K. Parasaran, Attorney General, A.K. Ganguli, P. Parmes waran and K. Swamy for the Respondents.
The following Order of the Court was delivered: ORDER In respect of the civil miscellaneous petition for clarification of this Court 's judgment dated 4th November, 1988, it is made clear that the assessable value of the processed fabric would be the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor plus the value of the job work done plus manufacturing profit and manufacturing expenses whatev er these may be, which will either be included in the price at the factory gate or deemed to be the price at the factory gate for the processed fabric.
The factory gate here means the ""deemed"" factory gate as if the processed fabric was sold by the processor.
In order to explain the position it is made clear by the following illustration: if the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor is Rs.20 and the value of the job work done is Rs.5 and the manufacturing profit and expenses for the processing be Rs.5, then in such a case the value would be Rs.30, being the value of the grey cloth plus the value of the job work done plus manufac turing profit and expenses.
That would be the correct as sessable value.
If the trader, who entrusts cotton or man made fabric to the processor for processing on job work basis, would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market, that would be taken by the Excise authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabric and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis provided that the declaration as to the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market, would include only the price or deemed price at which the processed fabric would leave the processor 's factory plus his profit.
Rule 174 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 346 enjoins that when goods owned by one person are manufactured by another the information is required relating to the price at which the said manufacturer is selling the said goods and the person so authorised agrees to discharge all the liabil ities under the said Act and the rules made thereunder.
The price at which he is selling the goods must be the value of the grey cloth or fabric plus the value of the job work done plus the manufacturing profit and the manufacturing expenses but not any other subsequent profit or expenses.
It is necessary to include the processor 's expenses, costs and charges plus profit, but it is not necessary to include the trader 's profits who gets the fabrics processed, because those would be post manufacturing profits.
","On a civil miscellaneous petition for clarification of this Court 's judgment dated 4th November, 1988, the Court.
HELD: The assessable value of the processed fabric would be the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor plus the value of the job work done plus manufacturing profit and manufacturing expenses whatever these may be, which will either be included in the price at the factory gate or deemed to be the price at the factory gate for the processed fabric.
[345D E] The factory gate means the ""deemed"" factory gate as if the processed fabric was sold by the processor.
[345E] If the trader.
who entrusts cotton or man made fabric to the processor for processing on job work basis, would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market, that would be taken by the Excise authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabric and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis.
Such a declaration would include only the price or deemed price at which the processed fabric would leave the processor 's factory plus his profit.
It is necessary to include the processor 's expenses, costs and charges plus profit, but not the trader 's profits who gets the fabrics processed, because those would be post manufacturing profits.

5888,"ivil Appeal No. 4031 of 1988.
From the Judgment and Order dated 14.4.1988 of the Patna High PG NO 867 PG NO 868 Court in C.W.J.C. No. 1923 of 1988.
R.K. Jain, R.P.Singh and Y.D.Chandrachud for the Appellant.
U.S. Prasad for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.
Special leave granted.
The order dated 25th March, 1988 of the Collector is under challenge in this appeal.
The same reads as follows: ""Shri Raghu Nath Thakur S/o Late Gorakh Thakur, Village Repura, P.S. Puksha, District Samastipur had bid for Rs.11,900 (Rupees eleven thousands only) per month Dak in an auction of Beni Country liquor shop held on 27.3.88 and he as given the shop of Beni Country liquor but after signing in Bandobasti Register he did not deposit dak amount.
The name of Shri Raghu Nath Thakur S/o Late Gorakh Nath Village Repura, P.S. Pusa, Distt.
Samastipur is therefore placed in the black list for future under the orders passed by the Collector, Samastipur.
"" This order was passed pursuant to the order of the Collector.
The letter dated 25th March, 1988, states as follows: ""The Collector of the district after perusal of the said office note passed order on 25.3.88 which is produced in verbatim below: Ist bidder chunki defaulter hai atah security prapt kar len tatha bhavishya ke liae Black list karen.
"" Indisputably, no notice had been given to the appellant of the proposal of black listing the appellant.
It was contended on behalf of the State Government that there was no requirement in the rule of giving any prior notice before black listing any person.
In so far as the contention that there is no requirement specifically of giving any notice is concerned, the respondent is right.
But it is an implied principle of the rule of law that any order having civil consequence should be passed only after following the PG NO 869 principles of natural justice.
It has to be realised that black listing any person in respect of business ventures has civil consequence for the future business of the person concerned in any event.
Even if the rules do not express so, it is an elementary principle of natural justice that parties affected by any order should have right of being heard and making representations against the order.
In that view of the matter, the last portion of the order in so far as it directs black listing of the appellant in respect of future contracts, cannot be sustained in law.
In the premises, that portion of the order directing that the appellant be placed in the black list in respect of future contracts under the Collector is set aside.
So far as the cancellation of the bid of the appellant is concerned, that is not affected.
This order will, however, not prevent the State Government or the appropriate authorities from taking any future steps for blacklisting the appellant if the Government is so entitled to do so in accordance with law, i.e. giving the appellant due notice and an opportunity of making representation.
After hearing the appellant, the State Government will be at liberty to pass any order in accordance with law indicating the reasons therefor.
We, however, make it quite clear that we are not expressing any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the allegations made against the appellant.
The appeal is thus disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
","The appellant has bid in an auction of Beni Country Liquor Shop in the District of Samastipur and was given the shop being the highest bidder but he failed to deposit the bid money in time.
The Collector, Samastipur by an order cancelled the bid and black listed the appellant.
He then moved the High Court against the order of the Collector.
The High Court upheld the order of the Collector.
The appellant appealed to this Court by special leave.
Disposing of the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1.
It is an implied principle of the rule of law that any order having civil consequences should be passed only after following the principles of natural justice.

R.K. Garg, S.P. Singh, N.M. Popli, R.B. Misra, Uma Nath Misra and R.C. Kaushik for the Appellants.
R.B. Mehrotra for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MISRA, J.
Special leave granted.
The short question in these appeals is as to whether the High Court was right in upholding the decision of the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission to re hold the recruitment examination.
On the requisition of the State Government the State Public Service Commission had undertaken the recruitment to the post of Upper Zila Basic Shiksha Adhikari (Women), District Inspectress of Girls Schools/Associate Regional Inspectress of Girls Schools in Uttar Pradesh Educational Service Junior Scale (Women 's Branch) The advertisement inviting applications from eligible candidates was published on May 5, 1985 and a corrigendum was published on June 8, 1985.
The recruitment examination was in two stages written and interview/personality test.
After the written examina tion was over, on the basis of the results thereof success ful candidates upto a base limit have to be called to be interviewed.
On account of improper feeding into the comput er some of the candidates who had better performance in the written examination were not called and candidates securing lesser marks in the written examination were not only called for interview but were also finally selected.
When this position was known and upon an inquiry was factually estab lished, the Public Service Commission decided to cancel the entire recruitment examination and asked for re holding of it.
The High Court has upheld the action of the Public Service Commission and has dismissed the writ petitions.
We have heard counsel for the parties and are of the view that when no defect was pointed out in regard to the written examination and the sole objection was confined to exclusion of a group of successful candidates in the written examination from the interview, there was no justification for cancelling the written part of the recruitment examina tion.
On the other hand, the situation could have been appropriately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for a 126 fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination and select those who on the basis of the written and the freshly held interview became eligible for selection.
We allow the appeals, set aside the judgment of the High Court and direct that the order of the Public Service Com mission cancelling the written examination shall stand vacated.
In lieu thereof we direct that the results of the written examination shall stand sustained and shall form the basis for the interview part of the recruitment and on the basis of the two examinations and in terms of the recruit ment rules fresh selections shall be made.
We would clarify that with the dismissal of the special leave petitions the selection of the two Scheduled Caste candidates and five Backward Class candidates has become final and would not be disturbed.
The State Public Service Commission should have been more careful in dealing with the matter so that four years in the process of recruitment would not have been lost and the public cause would not have suffered; public time would not have been wasted in requiring re doing of what had once been done and the litigation could have been avoided.
We have also not been able to appreciate the justification for cancellation of the written part of the recruitment examina tion and drive the candidates to litigation.
On the facts alleged we direct that the recruitment which is now to be re done by completing the interview examination should be finalised within four months hence.
There shall be no order as to costs.
T.N.A. Appeals allowed.
","The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission conducted recruitment examination to the post of Upper Zila Basic Shiksha Adhikari (Women) in two stages written test and interview.
The Commission cancelled the entire recruitment examination for re holding it, after it was found that due to improper feeding into the computer candidates who secured lesser marks in the written examination were interviewed and finally selected while candidates who had better performance were not called for interview.
Writ petitions challenging the action of the Commission were dismissed by the High Court.
Hence these appeals.
Allowing the appeals and setting aside the judgment of the High Court, this Court, HELD: When no defect was pointed out in regard to the written examination and the sole objection was confined to exclusion of a group of successful candidates in the written examination from the interview, there was no justification for cancelling the written part of the recruitment examina tion.
[125G] The situation on the other hand could have been appro priately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for a fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination and selection of those who on the basis of the written and the freshly held interview became eligible for selection.

From the Judgement and Order dated 6.10.1989 of the Karnataka High Court W.A. Nos.
321 & 322 of 1989.
S.R. Bhat for the Petitioners.
R.N. Narasimha Murthy, K.H. Nobin Singh, M. Veerappa and S.N. Bhatt for the Respondents.
The following Order of the Court was delivered: A few facts are necessary for the disposal of these petitions.
The petitioners were the owners of certain lands which were acquired by the respondents under the provisions of Sections 17 and 19 of the Bangalore Development Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Bangalore Act"").
Under the provisions of Section 36 of the Bangalore Act, where the acquisitions, otherwise than by agreement, it will be regulated by the provisions , as far they are applicable, of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Land Acquisition Act"").
Section 11 A of the Land Acquisition Act, which section was included in the said Act in 1984 as set out hereinafter, very briefly states, provides that the Collector must make his award within two years from the date of the publication of the declaration and that if no award is made within that period, the entire proceedings for acqui 565 sition of the land shall lapse.
Under the Explanation to the first proviso to Section 11 A,""the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration is stayed by an order of a Court shall be excluded"".
It was, inter alia contended by the petitioners that as the awards in these cases has not been made within two years of the notification making the declaration under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, the entire acquisition proceedings had lapsed.
That contention was repelled along with certain other contentions in the judgment of the High Court which is sought to be impugned before us.
The relevant dates which have to be borne in mind in this connection, are as follows: The notification making the declaration under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act in respect of the lands in question was made on September 20, 1977.
On September 20, 1984 Section 11 A which introduced into the Land, Acquisition Act by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984, was brought into force.
Under the first proviso to Section 11 A it was prescribed that where the said declaration (under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act) has been published before the commencement of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984, the award must be made within a period of two years from such commencement.
Thus, the award should have been made within two years from September 20, 1984.
On September 11, 1985, the petitioners obtained an interim order from this Court directing status quo with regard to the possession of the lands in question in Special Leave Petition No. 294 of 1985 preferred against the order of the Karnataka High Court dated August 14, 1984, with which we are not directly concerned here.
The said Special Leave Petition No.294 of 1985 was dismissed on April 29, 1987.
On December 16 17, 1987, two writ petitions were field by the respective petitioners in the Karnataka High Court challenging the acquisition on the ground that the awards were not made within the stipulated time.
In these two writ petitions, the Karnataka High Court granted interim stay of further proceedings in respect of the acquisition of the said lands.
These petitions were dismissed by a learned Single Judge of that High Court on November 29, 1988.
Appeals against the decision of a learned Single Judge were dismissed by the Karnataka High Court on October 6, 1989, by a Division Bench of that High Court.
The petitioners preferred these Special Leave Petitions, namely S.L.P. Nos. 823 and 824 of 1990 against the decision of the Devision Bench of that High Court, and obtained an interim stay of dispossession therein.
Whatever the ultimate effect of the stay orders, in view of the provisions of Section 11 A of the Land Acquisition Act, to which we have already referred 566 earlier, it is beyond dispute that the fact of the stay orders was highly material in the determination of these Special Leave Petitions.
Curiously enough, there is no reference in the Special Leave Petitions to any to the stay orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter affidavit.
In our view, the said interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non disclosure of the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts.
On this ground alone, the Special Leave Petitions are liable to be rejected.
It is well settled in law that the relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of facts.
If he fails to do so and suppresses material facts, his application is liable to be dismissed.
We accordingly dismiss the Special Leave Petitions.
There will be no order as to costs of these petitions.
R.P. SLPs dismissed.
","Petitioners ' lands were acquired by the respondents under sections 17 and 19 of the Bangalore Development Act, 1976.
Section 36 of the said Act made applicable the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, where acquisition is otherwise than by agreement.
The notification making the declaration under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act in respect of the lands in question was made on 20.9.1977.
On 20.9.1984s.
11 A was introduced and brought into force by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 prescribing that where the declaration under section 4 of the Land Acquisition ACt was published before the commencement of the Land Acquistion (Amendment) Act, 1984, the award was to be made within two years from such commencement.
The awards should have thus been made within two years from 20.9.1984.
On 11.9.1985 the petitioners obtained an interim order from this Court directing status quo with regard to the possession of the lands in question in a special leave petition which was dismissed on 29.4.87.
on December 16 17,1987 two writ petitions were filed by the petioners in the High Court Challenging the acquisition, contending that as the awards were not made within two years of the notification making the declaration under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, the entire acquisition proceedings had lapsed.
The High Court granted interim stay in respect of the acquisition of the lands.
The petitions were later dismissed.
Appeals therefrom were also dismissed by a Division Bench.
The petitioners preferred these special leave petitions and obtained interim stay of dispossession.
Dismissing the special leave petitions, this Court, 564 HELD: 1.
The relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of facts.
If he fails to do so and suppresses material facts, his application is liable to be dismissed.[566B C] 2.Whatever the ultimate effect of the stay orders, in view of the provisions of section 11 A of the Land Acquisition ACt, the Fact of the stay orders was highly material in the determination of these special leave petitions.

4807,"Civil Appeal No. 1433 of 1977 Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 16th February, 1.977 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No. 752 of 1977.
J.D. Jain & Mrs. Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
Harbans Lal, I.S. Goel & R.N. Poddar for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, CJ.
Section 33 of the Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads Act; 1961 (""The Act"") provided in so far as relevant, that subject to rules made by the Government, a Panchayat Samiti may employ such servants as it may consider necessary for the efficient performance of the duties imposed upon it by the Act, rules or bye laws made thereunder or by.
any other law for the time being in force.
In pursuance of this power, the appellant was appointed as a clerk on June 1, 1963 by the Panchayat Samiti, Loharu, which is respondent 3 in this appeal.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
On January 21, 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On March 14, 1975 a resolution was passed by respondent 3 regularising the post of Head Clerk.
On April 1, 1975, the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
The Punjab Panchayat Samitis, Zilla Parishads (Haryana Amendment) Act, 1973 introduced extensive amendments in the Act of 1961.
Section 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
The Amending Act received the assent of the Governor 736 on April 25, 1973 and was published in the Haryana Gazette on June 13, 1973.
Sections 35(1) of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes connected therewith and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samiti from time to time.
Section 35(3) which dealt with the conditions of service of the Government servants allotted to the Panchayat Samitis, was amended by section 14 of the Amending Act of 1973.
Sub section (4) of section 14 of the Amending Act provides that persons employed by a Panchayat Samiti before April 1, 1973 and who were in service at the commencement of the Amending Act shall continue to service on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Panchayat Samiti"", until they are absorbed in the Government service or retire in such manner as may be prescribed.
Acting in pursuance of the provision of section 14(4) of the Amending Act, the Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk though, as stated earlier he was working as a head Clerk in the Loharu Panchayat Samiti.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post, he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
The writ petition having been dismissed by the High Court, the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.
The appellant was appointed as a clerk by the Loharu Panchayat Samiti in 1963, long before the Amending Act came into force on June 13, 1973.
He was, therefore, entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.
But, as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973, the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
The fact that the appellant was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis in January 1974, or the further fact that he was appointed as a Head Clerk on April 1, 1975, cannot improve his position for the simple reason that these appointments were made after June 13, 1973, being the date on which the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to.
the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 14(4) of the Amending Act, the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Since the appellant, according to the terms and conditions of his service with the Panchayat, was entitled to be considered for promotion to the post of a Head Clerk, his appointment as a Head Clerk prior to his absorption in Government service had to be recognised and protected, despite the fact that such appointment was made after June 13, 1973 when the Amending Act came into force.
There is no substance in this contention.
Even assuming for the purposes of argument that the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service, what is relevant for our purpose is not whether the appellant was entitled to be considered for promotion but, whether the Panchayat Samiti had the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
Clearly, it had fortified that right on June 13, 1973.
It could not, therefore, have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk, as it purported to do, in January 1974 on an ad hoc basis or in April 1975 on a regular basis.
The appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law, the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
For these reasons, the appeal fails and is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
S.R. Appeal dismissed.
","Section 33 of the Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads Act, 1961 provided that subject to rules made by the Government, a Panchayat Samiti may employ such servants as it may consider necessary for the efficient performance of the duties imposed upon it by the Act, rules or bye laws made thereunder or by any other law for the time being in force.
The Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads (Haryana Amendment Act, 1973 which came into force from June, 13, 1973, introduced extensive amendments.
Section 33 of the Act was deleted by Section 13 of the Amending Act, Sub section (4) of Section 14 the Amending Act, provided that persons employed by a Panchayat Samiti before April 4, 1973 and who were in service at the commencement of the Amending Act, ""shall continue to serve on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Panchayat Samiti"" until they are absorbed in the Government Service or retire in such manner as may be prescribed.
Section 35(1) of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes annexed therewith, and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samitis from time to time.
The appellant was appointed as a clerk on June 1, 1963 by the Panchayat Samiti, Loharu.
He was confirmed in that post ill course of time.
On January 21, 1974, he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On March, 14 1975 a resolution was passed by the Samiti regularising the post of Head Clerk.
On April 1, 1975, the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
Acting in pursuance of the provision of Section 14(1) of the.
the Amending Act, The Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk, though he was working as a Head Clerk since January 21, 1974.
Being aggrieved the appellant filed a Writ Petition and prayed for a direction to absorb him as a Head Clerk.
The Writ Petition having been dismissed by the High Court, the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.1.
The Panchayat Samiti had no right to appoint the appellant to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
As a result of the deletion of Section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973, the 735 Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointment to the Panchayat.
It could not therefore have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk, as it purported to do so, in January, 1974 on an adhoc basis or in April 1965 on a regular basis.
[737D] 1.2.
Though the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service, in the instant case, the appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law, the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.

2796,"N: Criminal Appeal No. 87 of 1967.
721 Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 24, 1967 of the High Court of Mysore in Criminal Appeal .No.
29 of 1965.
A. section R. Chari and R. V. Pillai, for the appellants.
Shyamala Pappu and section P. Nayar, for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hidayatullah, C.J.
, These are 14 appellants who appeal against their conviction under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code and sentences of 5 years ' rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1,000/ passed on them.
Originally 20 persons were tried and convicted for the same offence and received a like sentence.
14 alone have appealed to this Court.
The incident which took place on July 28, 1962 was theft by dacoity of certain cotton pieces from two carts within the limits of Lingsugar Police Station at about 11 30 p.m.
The facts are that two traders in cloth sent their wares in carts for sale.
The cartmen halted after the market was over on the way for food.
Thereafter six carts left for Mudgal at about 10 p.m.
When the carts reached a Nala called Heri Halla about three miles from Lingsugur at about 11 30 p.m., 20 persons are said to have approached the carts and pelted stones.
It was a dark night and the assailants were not identified.
It appears that four out of the six carts escaped, but two carts were looted.
The police investigated the case and arrested the 20 persons who were accused in the case as being the culprits involved in this incident.
It is not necessary to go into rest of the case or the evidence on which the case of dacoity was established, because dacoity as such is not challenged before us.
The accused were convicted on the sole evidence of having in their possession pieces of cloth which were later identified to belong to the traders.
Searches took place between July 30, 1962 and August 17, 1962.
In these searches cloth which was undoubtedly stolen at the time of the dacoity was found in their houses.
The High Court, and the Court below drew from this the conclusion that the appellants were themselves the dacoits, and convicted them accordingly under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to ' 5 years ' rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 100/ .
In this appeal, the only contention raised by Mr. A. section R. Chari is that the presumption that they were dacoits ought not to have been drawn since the circumstances do not admit the drawing of such a presumption in the case, According to Mr. Chari, the presumption to be drawn ought to have been one under section 41 1 722 of Indian Penal Code or at the most tinder section 412 of the Indian Penal Code but not of complicity in the crime of dacoity.
He contends that the circumstances under which the one presumption or the other may be drawn under section 114 of the have not been stated by law and therefore it is necessary always to start with the lesser presumption and draw the higher presumption only when there is some other evidence to show the complicity of the persons in the crime itself.
According to him there is no other evidence in the case which points, to the complicity of the 14 appellants in the crime of dacoity and therefore as they cannot be suspected to be dacoits themselves, the only presumption to be drawn is one of receivers of stolen property or as receivers of property which was stolen in a dacoity.
In our opinion, the law advocated by Mr. Chari is not correct.
If there is other evidence, to connect an accused with the crime itself, however small, the finding of the stolen property with him is a piece of evidence which connects him further with the crime.
There is then no question of presumption.
The evidence strengthens the other evidence already against him.
It is only when the accused cannot be connected with the crime except by reason of possession of the fruits of crime that the presumption may be drawn.
In what circumstances the one presumption or the other may be drawn, it is not necessary to state categorically in this case.
It all depends upon the circumstances under which the discovery of the fruits of crime are made with a particular accused.
It has been stated on more than one occasion that if the gap of time is, too large, the presumption that the accused was concerned with the crime itself gets weakened.
The presumption is stronger when the discovery of the fruits of crime is made immediately after the crime is.
committed.
The reason is obvious.
Disposal of the fruits of crime requires the finding of a person ready to receive them and the shortness of time, the nature of the property which is disposed of, that is to say, its quantity and its character determine whether the person who had the goods in his possession received them from another or was himself the thief or the dacoit.
In some cases there may be other elements which may point to the way as to how the presumption may be drawn.
They need not be stated here for they differ from case to case.(In the present case, the goods stolen were a large quantity of cloth taken for sale to the market.
These goods were not sold and were being taken back to the dealers by the cartmen.) A large number of persons said to be 20 in number pelted stones at the cartmen and looted the, property.
Immediately afterwards a number of searches were made and the goods were found with various persons who were prosecuted as offenders and they have been presumed to be involved in the dacoity itself.
It may be 723 noticed that from each person a large number of goods of the same type such as 20 choli pieces or ten pieces of cloth were found.
(It is, impossible to think that within the short time available, these goods could have been easily disposed of to receivers of stolen property or could be placed in the custody of friends till such time as the original offenders could take them away.) The time gap in some cases is as short as two days and in some others it is not more than five days.
In two cases only the time gap is about 19 days.
Even then we think that the time gap is too short for original offenders to have disposed of the property to these appellants Or to have left the goods in their custody till such time as the original offenders could have taken them away.
We are, therefore, satisfied that the proper inference was drawn in this case.
It must not be forgotton that the offence was committed at night by as many as 20 persons or more.
The houses of 20 persons were searched and large quantities of the stolen goods were found in their houses.
It is impossible to think that these 20 persons were merely receivers of stolen property from some other 20 persons who were the dacoits.
It is legitimate therefore to raise the presumption in this case that the persons with whom the goods were found were the dacoits themselves.
This presumption has been drawn and in our opinion rightly in this case The conviction was therefore correct in 'all the circumstances of the case.
As regards the sentence, the offence no doubt was serious.
But no injury beyond one appears to have been caused.
Therefore we think that a sentence of three years ' rigorous imprisonment will meet the ends of justice in this case.
The sentence is reduced to three years ' rigorous imprisonment.
The sentence of fine will stand.
The appeal is allowed to this extent.
G.C. Appeal partly allowed.
","Two carts loaded with cloth returning alongwith others from a weekly village market were looted by 20 or more persons.
The houses of 20 persons including the 14 appellants were searched and the looted cloth was recovered from their Possession.
They were tried and held guilty Linder section 395 of the Indian Penal Code.
The High Court dismissed their appeals.
In appeal by special leave to this Court their only contention was that in the absence of other evidence connecting them with the dacoity, the presumption to be drawn from the possession of stolen clothes ought to have been one under section 411 of he Indian Penal Code or at the most under section 412 of the Indian Penal Code and not of complicity in the crime of dacoity.
It was urged that since section 114 of the Evidence Act did not lay down definitely the presumption to be drawn in a given set of circumstances it was necessary always to start with the lesser presumption and draw the higher presumption only when there was some other evidence to.
show the complicity of the persons in the crime itself.
HELD : If there is other evidence to connect an accused with the crime itself, however small, the finding of the stolen property with him is a piece of evidence which connects him further with the crime.
There is then no question of presumption.
The evidence strengthens the other evidence already against him.
It is only when the accused cannot be conis stronger than if there is a large gap of time.
Disposal of the fruits of crime that the presumption may be drawn.
In what circumstances the one presumption or the other may be drawn will differ from case to case [722 D] When the discovery of the fruits of crime is made immediately after the commission of the crime the presumption of complicity in the crime nected with the crime except by reason of possession of the fruits of crime requires the finding of a person ready to receive them and the 'shortness of time, the nature of the property which is disposed of, that is to say, its quality and character determine whether the person who had the goods in his possession received them from another or was himself the thief or dacoit, [722 F] In the present case the offence was committed at night by as many as 'IO persons or more.
Shortly after the offence the houses of 20 persons were searched and large quantities of the stolen goods were found in their houses.
It was impossible that these 20 persons were merely 'receivers of stolen property from some other 20 persons who were the decoits.
It was legitimate therefore to raise the presumption in this case that the persons with whom the goods were found were the dacoits themselves.

4963,"Tax Reference Cases Nos. 3 to 5 of 1975 Tax Reference under Section 257 of the Income tax Act, 1961 made by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal, Cuttack Bench, Cuttack P.A. Francis, Champat Rai and Miss A. Subhashini for the Appellant.
C.S.S. Rao for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 308 PATHAK, J.
: These references under s.27(1) of the have been made by the Income Tax Appellate tribunal, Cuttack Bench at the instance of the Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Orissa for the opinion of this Court on the following question of law: ""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Wealth Tax Officer was in law justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee interest due on accrual basis (though not realised) on the outstandings of the money lending business, the accounts of the assessee being maintained on cash basis ?"" The respondent assessee was assessed to wealth tax for the assessment years 1965 66, 1966 67 and 1967 68 (the respective valuation dates being March 31, 1965, March 31, 1966 and March 31, 1967), in the status of a 'Hindu Undivided Family.
In each of the assessments, the Wealth Tax Officer included a sum of Rs. 1,50,000 estimated as the accrued interest on the assessee 's money lending investments.
The assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and urged that as it maintained its books of account in accordance with the cash system of accounting the accrued interest on the money lending investments could not be included in the wealth tax assessments.
The contention found favour with the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and accordingly he deleted the additions of Rs. 1,50,000 representing accrued interest.
In doing so the Appellate Assistant Commissioner followed ""Commissioner of Wealth tax Bihar and Orissa vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju (Orissa)(1), The Wealth Tax Officer appealed to the Appellate Tribunal and contended that accrued interest was liable to be included in the wealth tax assessments of the assessee.
The Wealth Tax Officer sought support from a judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedreva Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth tax(2) A.P.
The Appellate Tribunal observed that the judgment of the Orissa High Court was binding on it, and accordingly by a consolidated order dated April 3, 1972, it dismissed the appeals.
The Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under sub section
(1) of section 27 of the Wealth (1) (2) 309 Tax Act for a reference of the cases to this Court in view of the conflict of opinion between the Orissa High Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court, and so these references have been made.
The question can be disposed of shortly.
Under section 3 of the Wealth Tax Act, wealth tax is charged for every assessment year in respect of the net wealth of the assessee on the corresponding valuation date.
The expression ""net wealth"" is defined by cl.
(m) of s.2 of the Act as ""the amount by which the aggregate value . .
Of all the assets, wherever located, belonging to the assessee on the valuation date. is in excess of the aggregate value of all the debts owed by the assessee on the valuation date. "" According to the scheme of the Wealth Tax Act, the net wealth of an assessee has to be determined as it obtains on a particular date.
That is the ""valuation date"".
Clause (q) of s 2 defines the expression ""valuation date"" as follows: ; ""(q) Valuation date, in relation to any year for which an assessment is to be made under this Act, means the last day of the previous year as defined in (Section 3) of the Income Tax Act, if an assessment were to be made under that Act for that year; Provided that (i) Where in the case of an assessee there are different previous years under the Income Tax Act for different sources of income, the valuation date for the purposes of this Act shall be the last day of the last of the previous years aforesaid, (ii) in the case of a person who is not an assessee within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, the valuation date for the purposes of this Act shall be the 31st day of March immediately preceding the assessment (z year; (iii)where an assessment is made in pursuance of section 19A, the valuation date shall be the same valuation date as would have been adopted in respect of the net wealth of the deceased if he were alive.
"" 310 The computation of the net wealth of an assessee calls for a determination of his assets and debts as on the valuation date.
The definition embodied in the substantive part of cl.
(q) of s.2 indicates that broadly Parliament has fixed upon the last day of the ""previous year"", as defined under the Income Tax Act, as the valuation date.
The figure of net wealth of the assessee at the end of the ""previous year"" takes into account the financial activities of the assessee during that ""previous year"".
His financial activities during that period determine how his net wealth on a particular valuation date differs from his net wealth on the immediately preceding valuation date.
There is an obvious advantage in adopting as the valuation date the last day of a period which is also the relevant period under the Income Tax Act.
The reasons for defining the valuation date in terms of the last day of the income tax ""previous year"" stop there.
The system of accounting, mercantile or cash or hybrid, is of no relevance for the purpose of determining the assets of the assessee.
That appears plainly from the definition or ""net wealth"" which speaks of ""the aggregate value. of all the assets"" belonging to the assessee on the valuation date.
All the assets of the assessee, bar those expressly excepted by the statute, are to be taken into account, and it is immaterial whether the assessee employs one system of accounting or another.
There is clear indication that the assets to be considered are not circumscribed by any consideration of the particular system of accounting adopted by the assessee.
The assets are not confined to cash.
Where the asset is an asset other than cash, its value is determined pursuant to sub section
(I) of s.7 as the estimated price, which, in the opinion of the Wealth Tax Officer, the asset would fetch if sold in the open market on the valuation date.
In other words, it would be the estimated open market value of the rights in the property which constitute the asset.
When we speak of the value of a property, on a legal plane we refer to the value of the rights in that property.
It is apparent that what accrues as a right also falls to be included within the assets of an assessee under the Wealth Tax Act.
That being so, the conclusion is inescapable that even though the accounts of the assessee are maintained on cash basis interest due on accrual basis, though not realised, on the outstandings of the money lending business are liable to be included in the net wealth of the assessee.
In this view of the matter, we approve of the opinion expressed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedrevu Venkappa Rao (supra) 311 and in Commissioner of Wealth Tax, A.P. I vs Pachigolla Narasimha Rao(1) and the Calcutta High Court in Dipti Kumar Basu vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax, West Bengal(2) and hold that the view taken by the Orissa High Court in Commissioner of Wealth tax vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju (Orissa) (supra) and by the Karnataka High Court in A. T. Mirji vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Karnataka(3) cannot be accepted.
In the result, the question is answered in the affirmative, in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
There is no order as to costs.
","The respondent assessee was assessed to wealth tax for the assessment years 1965 66, 1966 67 and 1967 68, in the status of a Hindu Undivided Family '.
In each of the assessment years, the Wealth Tax Officer included a sum of Rs. 1.5 lakhs estimated as the accrued interest on the assessee 's money lending investments.
The assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, con tending that as the books of account were maintained in accordance with the cash system of accounting, the accrued interest on the money lending investment could not be included in the Wealth Tax assessments, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner following the decision of the Orissa High Court in Commissioner of Wealth tax Bihar and Orissa vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju (Orissa) (1971)79 ITR 330 deleted the additions representing accrued interest.
The Wealth Tax Officer, appealed to the Appellate Tribunal and con tended that the accrued interest was liable to be included in the Wealth Tax assessment of the assessee, relying on the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedrevu Venkappa Rao vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax A.P.
The Appellate Tribunal dismissed the appeal, as it was bound by the decision of the Orissa High Court.
The Commissioner of Wealth Tax applied under Section 27(1) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 for a reference to the Supreme Court in view of the conflict of opinions between the Orissa High Court and the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the question: ""Whether the Wealth Tax Officer was justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee, interest due on accrual basis (though not realised) on the outstandings 307 of the assessee 's money lending business, the accounts being maintained on cash,"" was referred to this Court.
^ HELD: 1.
Even though the accounts of the assessee are maintained on cash basis interest due on accrual basis, though not realised, on the out standings of the money, lending business is liable to be included in the net wealth of the assessee.
[310G] 2.
The value of a property refers to the value of the rights in that property.
What accrues as a right also falls to be included within the assets of an assessee under the Wealth Tax Act 1957.
[310F] 2.1.
The system of accounting, mercantile or cash or hybrid, is of no relevance for the purpose of determining the assets of the assessee.
That appears plainly from the definition of ""net wealth"" which speaks of ""the aggregate value. of all the assets"" belonging to the assessee on the valuation date.
All the assets of the assessee, bar those expressly excepted by the statute, are to be taken into account, and it is immaterial whether the assessee employs one system of accounting or another.

The assets are not confined to cash.
Where the asset is an asset other than cash, its value is determined pursuant to sub section (I) of section 7 as the estimated price, which, in the opinion of the Wealth Tax Officer, the asset would fetch if sold in the open market on the valuation date.
It would be the estimated open market value of the rights in the property which constitute the asset.

6413,": Criminal Appeal No. 8 18 of 1979.
From the Judgment & Order dated the 27.10.1979 of the Madras High Court in Crl.
A. No. 4 of 1977.
A.S. Nambiar and K.R. Nambiar for the Appellant.
V. Krishnamurthy for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FATHIMA BEEVI, J.
This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 27.10.1979 of the High Court of Madras con firming the conviction of the appellant under section 161, I .P.C. and under section 336 5(2) read with section 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corrup tion Act.
The appellant had been sentenced to undergo R.I. for 15 months under section 5(2) read with section 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act with no separate sen tence under section 161 I.P.C.
The brief facts of the case are as under.
The appellant, Sunderamoorthy was an Accountant cum Headclerk in the Tamil Nadu Forest Training School at Vaigai Dam.
He took charge of the office on 6.10.1975 and had been residing in a house opposite the training school.
PW 3, the Principal of the training school issued exhibit P 2 show cause notice to the PW 1, Venkataswamy, the canteen contractor, as to why his licence for running the canteen should not be cancelled.
This was on the basis of a complaint made by the appellant that the food served in the canteen was substand ard.
The appellant had taken food in the canteen for two days and being dissatisfied discontinued the practice before the notice was issued.
The prosecution case is that the accused thereafter sent for PW 1, informed him that he would help him in restoring the licence and demanded a bribe of Rs. 100.
On 21.10.1975, the appellant is stated to have pressed the demand to PW 1.
The latter made a complaint to PW 6 who thereupon arranged a trap.
As instructed, PW 1 was ready with ten rupees currency notes.
PW 6 after drawing up a mahazar in the presence of PW 2, Jaganathan, Assistant of the Office of the Special Tehsildar, Usilampatti directed PW 1 to give the notes to the appellant.
PW 1 handed over the money to the appellant who received the same.
When PW 1 emerged, PW 6 along with PW 2 confronted the appellant.
The appellant produced the currency notes.
PW 6 conducted the phenolphthalein test with reference to the fingers of the appellant.
The test was positive, the currency notes were seized and the appellant arrested.
PW 3, the Principal produced the concerned file relating to show cause notice, from the house of the appellant on the same day.
Finally, the appellant was chargesheeted.
At the trial, the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
PW 1 affirmed the fact that the appellant made the demand and had also received the amount on 22.10.
The recovery of the currency notes from the appellant was not challenged.
The plea of the appellant was that PW 1 had returned the amount due to him and there had been no demand for a bribe as there had been no occasion for doing so.
The Trial Court accepted the prosecution evidence, rejected the plea of the appellant and recorded the conviction.
Before the High Court, the .contentions of the appellant were that there was no independent evidence regarding the demand, the messenger who had contacted PW 1 at the 337 behest of the appellant had not been examined, the solitary evidence of PW 1 is insufficient, the explanation offered by the appellant was probable and there is no conclusive evi dence to hold that the appellant.
was guilty.
It was also urged that the appellant being new in the office could exert little influence on the Principal and the whole story is, therefore improbable.
These contentions did not find favour with the High Court.
It took the view that the evidence of PW 1 find corroboration in the testimony of PW 2 and 6 and the contemporary records.
The recovery of the currency notes from the appellant proves the guilty conduct of the appel lant in view of the presumption arising under section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act which has not been rebutted.
The decisions of the Court in State of Rajasthan vs Mohamed Habeeb, ; C.I. Ernden vs State of Uttar Pradesh; , and Lohana Kantilal vs State, AIR 1954 Saurashtra 12 1 were referred to.
The High Court thought that though the conviction under section 161 I.P.C. and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is to be maintained, no separate sentence need be award ed under section 161 I.P.C.
The appellant has reiterated the contentions before us.
The learned counsel appearing for the appellant, however, maintained that the appellant had a consistent case even from the earliest opportunity that the currency notes found in his possession was the money returned by PW 1, the cir cumstances of the case would probabalise this case of the appellant and the presumption, if any, arising under section 4 is rebutted and the conviction cannot therefore be sus tained.
PW 6 has stated at the time of the seizure the explanation offered by the appellant was that PW 1 had returned the loan and that he had given the money for the Dipawali.
The case that has been developed in the course of the trial is not that of a loan transaction but payment of an advance of Rs. 125 in the canteen when the appellant started to take food there.
The case of Dipawali gift or return of a loan given to PW 1 has not been even suggested.
It cannot, therefore, be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
PW 3, the Principal has averred in unequivocal terms that Ex.
P 2 memo had been issued on the basis of the complaint received from the appellant that on getting the explanation from PW 1 he on 18.10.1975 itself passed orders and closed the file.
The order made was not disclosed to PW 1 and till 22.10.1975, the file itself was kept by the appellant in his personal custody.
He had thereafter received the amount of Rs. 100 from PW 1.
This conduct of the appellant is clearly incon sistent with the transaction of loan or return of money by PW 1. 338 This Court observed in Dhanvantrai Balwantrai Desai vs State of Maharashtra, AIR 1964 SC 575 as under: ""Where any gratification (other than legal gratification) or any valuable thing is proved to have been received by an accused person the court is required to draw a presumption that the person received that thing as a motive of reward such as is mentioned in section 161, I.P.C. Therefore, the Court has no choice in the matter, once it is established that the accused person has received a sum of money which was not due to him as a legal remuneration.
Of course, it is open to that person to show that though that money was not due to him as legal remuneration it was legally due to him in some other manner or that he had received it under a transaction or an arrangement which was lawful.
The burden resting on the accused person in such a case would not be as light as it is where a presumption is raised under section 114 of Evidence Act and cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused is reasonable and probable.
it must further be shown that the explanation is a true one.
The words 'unless the contrary is proved ' which occur in this provision make it clear that the presumption has to be rebutted by 'proof ' and not by a bare explanation which is merely plausible.
A fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the Court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists.
Unless, there fore, the explanation is supported by proof, the presumption created by the provision cannot be said to be rebutted.
"" On a careful consideration of the facts and circum stances, we are not satisfied that the appellant had even by preponderance of probability succeeded in rebutting the presumption.
The argument that clause (d) of section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not attracted on the proved facts is also not impressive.
We find no merit in the appeal.
It is accordingly dismissed.
N.V.K. Appeal dismissed.
","The appellant was an Accountant cum Headclerk in the Forest Training School, PW 3 the Principal of the training school, and PW I the canteen contractor.
The prosecution alleged that on the basis of a complaint made by the appel lant that the food served in the canteen was substandard, PW 3 issued a show cause notice to PW I, as to why the licence for the canteen should not be cancelled and that thereafter the appellant sent for PW I and demanded a bribe of Rs. I00.
As the appellant pressed the demand from PW 1, the latter made a complaint to PW 6, the inspector, who arranged a trap.
The trap was arranged.
PW I handed over the money to the appellant, who received the same.
PW 6 conducted the phe nolphthalein test with reference to the fingers of the appellant.
The test was positive.
The currency notes were seized, and the appellant arrested chargesheeted.
The Trial Judge accepted the prosecution evidence, rejected the pleas of the appellant that PW 1 had returned the amount of Rs. 100 due to him, that there had been no demand for a bribe as there had been no occasion for doing so, and recorded conviction.
The appellant appealed to the High Court and contended that there was no independent evidence regarding the demand, the messenger who had contacted PW 1 at the behest of the appellant had not been examined, the solitary evidence of PW I is insufficient and that the explanation offered by the appellant was probable and that there is no conclusive evidence to hold that the appellant was guilty.
The High Court took the view that the recovery of the currency notes from the appellant prove his guilty conduct, in view of the presumption arising under section 4(1) 01 ' the Prevention of Corruption Act and that the same has not been rebutted and held that though the conviction under 335 section 161 I.P.C. and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is to be maintained, no separate sen tence need be awarded under section 161 I.P.C. It, accord ingly, confirmed the conviction of the appellant and sen tenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 15 months.
In the appeal to this court, it was contended that the appellant had a consistent case even from the earliest opportunity, that the currency notes found in his possession was the money returned by PW I, and that the presumption, if any, arising under section 4 was rebutted, and the convic tion cannot therefore be sustained.
Dismissing the appeal, this Court HELD: 1.
The appellant has not even by preponderance of probability succeeded in rebutting the presumption under section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
[338C] 2.
The Court has no choice once it is established that the accused person has received a sum of money which was not due to him as a legal remuneration, but to draw a presump tion that the person received the money as a motive of reward.
However, it is open to that person to show that though that money was not due to him as legal remuneration, it was legally due to him in some other manner or that he received it under a transaction or an arrangement which was lawful.
The explanation offered by the person should be a true one and not one which is merely plausible.

Petition No. 15001 of 1989.
AND I.A. No. 1 of 1989 in S.L.P. No. 12288 of 1984.
From the Judgment and Order dated 20.4.1984 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court Appeal No. 472 of 1976.
K. Mahadeva Reddy, Ms. Manjul Gupta, T.V.S.N. Chari and A. Subba Rao for the Petitioner.
K. Ram Kumar, S.A. Ahmed, Tanweer Abdul and Mohan Pandey for the Respondents.
The following Order of the Court was delivered: 540 The special leave petition under Article 136 of the Constitution is directed against the affirming judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in a suit for title and injunction.
In view of the fact that a petition of compromise in respect of the entire subject matter of litigation has been filed in this Court it is unnecessary to refer to the facts leading to the litigation.
We shall, therefore, confine the discussion to matters pertinent to the compromise.
Subbamma adopted one K.V Seshiah.
Seshiah married two wives.
Through the first wife he had a son born to him by name Sudarshan Gupta and through the second another son by name Anand Babu.
In February, 1985, during the pendency of the special leave petition the adoptive mother died.
Sudarshan and Anand Babu led claim to the entire property of Subbamma exclusively to each of them under two different wills said to be by subbamma and each contended that the other will was a forged one.
With the death of the adoptive mother, Seshiah led claim to the entire property as heir.
While each of the parties had taken such stand in the litigation a compromise was brought about on 21.8.1987 between the father and his two sons and the same was filed in this Court.
The terms of the compromise stipulated payment of Rs. 1 lakh by the father to each of his two sons in lieu of relinquishment of their interest.
When the matter was listed before the Court for recording of the compromise, Sudarshan Gupta, second respondent herein, maintained that he had not been paid Rs.1 lakh as stipulated and he had no intention to accept the compromise.
The question as to recording of the compromise was taken up by the Court and parties have been heard.
One of the stipulation in the compromise deed which has admittedly been signed by the father and his two sons stipulates: ""The petitioner has given to the second and third respondents (the two sons) an amount of Rs. 1 lakh each and the second and third respondents have received the same."" In the face of such a statement in the compromise deed signed by the parties the second respondent had disputed the fact of payment and has, in the meantime, alienated about 81 acres of property which constitutes the subject matter of dispute to third parties.
The alienees 541 have now been brought on record unders order of this Court.
We have heard counsel for the original parties as also the alienees.
The alienations are for about a purported consideration of Rs. 4 lakhs.
The sale deeds indicate that a sum of Rs. 1 lakh had been received earlier and a net amount of Rs.77,124 out of the consideration money under these documents has been paid before the registering authority.
The alienees have admittedly been in possession of the property from the date of the sales which is more than three years ' old by now.
Admittedly, the transfers are pendente lite.
In fact, if the compromise is valid and binding the alienor respondent No. 2 had no interest in the property to part with in view of the stipulation in the compromise that on receipt of Rs. 1 lakh he relinquished his entire interest in the property.
The alienees have made an attempt to hold out that there were agreements for sale prior to the compromise for which there is no acceptable evidence.
We think we have to find that the alienees had no interest in the property prior to the compromise and we must hold that the sale deeds are subsequent to 21.8.1987.
Mr Ram Kumar who appeared for the second respondent, apart from maintaining that his client has not received the sum of Rs.1 lakh has not been able to point out any justification as to why the compromise should not be acted upon and on the basis of it the litigation may not be disposed of.
The factum of compromise is not in dispute.
Respondent No. 2 and his counsel Mr. Ram Kumar have accepted the fact that the parties have signed the compromise petition which contain terms which they had accepted and all parties have accepted the document of compromise to be genuine.
Counsel for the alienees has taken the stand that the said alienations are valid and the transferees have become owners of the property and has even maintained that there have been improvements of the property by the alienees.
He sought to rely on certain decisions which on being referred to were found to be totally inapplicable to the facts of the case.
On the other hand, we find that a similar question arose before the Orissa High Court in the case of Bhoja Govinda Maikap & Anr.
vs Janaki Dei & Ors., AIR (1980) Ori.
108 where the power of the Court under Order 23, rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the face of an objection of one of the parties to the compromise was considered.
Relying upon several authorities of different High Courts and one of the Privy Council referred to in the decision, the High 542 Court held that once the Court was satisfied that there was a compromise it was for the Court to record the same and no option lay before the Court to act otherwise.
We are in accord with the principle indicated in the said decision and are of the view that as the compromise petition is genuine and lawful the same has to be acted upon.
We direct that the compromise petition shall be accepted and in terms thereof the suit shall be disposed of and the terms of the compromise shall form part of the order to be drawn up in this Court for disposing of the special leave petition.
With a view to settling all equities between the parties and with the consent of Seshiah who is present in Court, and counsel for the sons and after hearing the Advocate for the alienees, we make the following directions: 1.
Seshaiah shall pay a sum of Rs. 1 lakh more to Sudarshan Gupta within eight weeks from today.
This amount shall be deposited in the Registry of this Court within the time indicated and Sudarshan Gupta shall be free to withdraw the amount.
Rs 77,124 being the amount paid by the alienees before the Sub Registrar in respect of the sale deeds shall be deposited within the same period in the Trial Court and the alienees of the different sale deeds would be entitled to withdraw the amounts on the basis of the record made by the Sub Registrar on each of the sale deeds.
The alienees have no right created under the alleged sale deeds.
Their possession is without authority of law.
Ordinarily, they would have been liable to account for mesne profits.
In view of the fact that there was the allegation of payment of Rs. 1 lakh to Sudarshan Gupta which we have not investigated and to meet the further allegation that some improvements have been made to the property which too we have not gone into, we direct that the mesne profits shall be set off against the same.
Under orders of this Court security has been furnished for mesne profits.
In view of the aforesaid direction, the security furnished in the Trial Court shall stand discharged and the alienees will have no liability to account for mesne profits.
We declare and clarify that none of the sale deeds is valid and none of the alienees has any interest in the aforesaid property.
543 4.
The alienees shall deliver vacant possession of the property by 30th of April, 1991, to Seshiah and in the event of failure to do so the Trial Court is directed by our present order to deliver vacant possession of the entire property in suit including those which are covered by the sale deeds in favour of the alienees to Seshiah within one month therefrom.
If necessary, the Trial Court may appoint a Commissioner and take police help for executing this order and such cost shall ultimately be borne by the defaulting alienees but may initially be met by Seshiah.
There would be no order for costs.

On the death of the adoptive mother, the appellant laid claim to her entire property as heir.
While each of the parties had taken such stand, in the litigation a compromise was brought about on 21.8.1987 between the appellant and his two sons, the respondents 2 and 3 and the same was filed in this Court and in terms of the compromise the appellant, to make payment of Rs. 1 lakh to each of his two sons in lieu of relinquishment of their interest.
When the matter was listed for recording the compromise, the respondent No. 2 contended that as he had not been paid Rs. 1 lakh as stipulated in the compromise, in the meanwhile he had alienated about 81 acres of the suit properties to the third parties.
The alienees had been also impleaded as parties under the orders of this Court.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the February 4, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1256 of 1954, arising out of the judgment and order dated June 19, 1954, of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, in Case No. 176/S of 1953.
Hardayal Hardy, for the appellants.
H. J. Umrigar and B. H. Dhebar, for the respondent.
April 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.
This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay reversing the judgment of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, and thus convicting accused Nos. 1 & 5 under section 31(1) read with section 33(1) of the (XIV of 1947) (hereinafter called the Act) and sentencing accused No. 1 to a fine of Rs. 250 and accused No. 5 to a fine of Rs. 50, 736 The appellants are the Andheri Marol Kurla Bus Service who was accused No. 1 (now appellant No. 1) and its Manager H. M. Khan who was accused No. 5 (now appellant No. 2).
Some disputes arose between the appellant No. 1 and its workmen.
On December 13, 1951, the Conciliation Officer wrote to the appellant No. I and enclosed the demands of the Union which were dated August 9, 1951.
On December 31, 1951, the appellant No. I was asked to appear before the Conciliation Officer on January 9, 1952, and after getting one adjournment the appellant No. I appeared before the Conciliation Officer on January 17, 1952, and filed its Written Statement and raised various objections.
The next date of hearing was January 31, 1952, and the proceedings went on till June 2, 1952, when the appellant No. 1 wrote to the Conciliation Officer saying that no useful purpose would be served by holding any further meetings.
On May 9, 1952, the Union had also indicated to the Conciliation Officer that the negotiations had failed.
On March 18, 1952, the appellant dismissed Louis Pereira, a bus conductor and proceedings were taken on a complaint by Assistant Commissioner of Labour under section 33 read with section 31 of the Act against 5 accused persons the two appellants and the partners of appellant No. 1.
The Chief Presidency Magistrate acquitted all the accused including the appellants and held that as the conciliation proceedings had continued for a period of more than 14 days as from January 17, 1952, further proceedings for conciliation were illegal and therefore the accused persons could not be convicted under section 31(1)of the Act.
The State took an appeal to the High Court and the judgment of acquittal was reversed and of the accused persons the two appellants were convicted and the others were acquitted.
The two appellants have appealed by special leave.
The question for decision is whether the conciliation proceedings could be said to be pending when Louis Pereira was dismissed.
If the answer is in the affirmative then the appellants have been properly convicted and if not the conviction must be set aside.
Section 31(1) makes the contravention of the provision 737 of section 33 of the Act an offence punishable with imprisonment for a period which may extend to six months or with fine or with both.
Section 33(1) pro K. vides: section 33(1) "" During the pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a conciliation officer or a Board or of any proceeding before a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal in respect of an industrial dispute, no employer shall: (a) in regard to any matter connected with the dispute, alter to the prejudice of the workmen concerned in such dispute, the conditions of service applicable to them immediately before the commencement of such proceedings; or (b) for any misconduct connected with the dispute, discharge or punish, whether by dismissal or otherwise, any workmen concerned in such dispute, save with the express permission in writing of the authority before which the proceeding is pending "".
Therefore the question reduces itself to the meaning of the words "" pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a conciliation officer "".
The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that the object of conciliation is to get a settlement made with expedition and therefore under section 12 the Conciliation Officer was bound to make his report within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period fixed by the appropriate Government.
From this it was submitted that as 14 days had expired before March 18, 1952, the dismissal could not be said to be one within the words "" pendency of conciliation proceedings "".
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
That sub section is as follows: section 20(1). . . . . . . . . (2) A conciliation proceeding shall be deemed to have concluded 93 738 (a) where a settlement is arrived at, when a memorandum of the settlement is signed by the par ties to the dispute; (b) where no settlement is arrived at, when the report of the conciliation officer is received by the appropriate Government or when the report of the Board is published under s, 17, as the case may be; or (c) when a reference is made to a Court, Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal under section 10 during the pendency of conciliation proceedings "".
The provisions of sub section 2 apply to all conciliation proceedings whether in regard to utility services or otherwise.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached, when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
The conciliation proceedings therefore do not end when the report under section 12( 6) is made by the Conciliation Officer but when that report is received by the appropriate Government.
It was contended that the conciliation proceedings should be held to terminate when the Conciliation Officer is required under section 12(6) of the Act to submit his report but the provisions of the Act above quoted do not support this contention as the termination of the conciliation proceedings is deemed to take place when the report is received by the appropriate Government.
This is how section 20(2)(b) was interpreted in Workers of the Industry Colliery, Dhanbad vs Management of the Industry Colliery (1).
It was next contended that on this interpretation the conciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond what was contemplated by the Act and the termination would depend upon how soon a report is received by the appropriate Government.
It is true that section 12(6) of the Act contemplates the submission of the report by the Conciliation Officer within 14 days but that does not affect the pendency of the conciliation proceedings and if for some reason the Conciliation Officer delays the submission of his report his action (1) ; 739 may be reprehensible but that will not affect the interpretation to be put on section 20(2)(b) of the Act.
Section 12 lays down the duties of the Conciliation_ officer.
He is required to bring about settlement between the parties and must begin his investigation without delay and if no settlement is arrived at he is to submit his report to the appropriate Government.
No doubt section 12 contemplates that the report should be made and the proceedings closed within a fortnight and if proceedings are not closed but are carried on, as they were in the present case, or if the Conciliation Officer does not make his report within 14 days he may be guilty of a breach of duty but in law the proceedings do not automatically come to an end after 14 days but only terminate as provided in section 20(2)(b) of the Act.
Colliery Mazdoor Congress, Asansol vs New Beerbhoom Coal Co. Ltd (1).
As the conciliation proceedings were pending at the time when Louis Pereira was dismissed the appellants were rightly convicted under section 31(1) read with section 33 of the Act.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
","Conciliation proceedings were started in January.
1952 with respect to some disputes between appellant 1 and its workmen.
On May 9, 1952, the Union and on June 2, 1952, the appellant 1 indicated to the Conciliation Officer that the negotiations had failed.
In the meantime on March ~I8, 1952, the appellant 1 dismissed (1) I.L.R. 1947 All.
735 one of its workmen.
The two appellants and three others were prosecuted under section 31 Of the , for a breach of section 33 for dismissing a workman during the pendency of the conciliation proceedings.
The appellants contended that since section 12(6) required the report of the conciliation proceedings to be submitted within 14 days of the commencement thereof, the proceedings had terminated on the expiry of the 14 days and the dismissal was, therefore, not during the pendency of the conciliation proceedings.
Held that, in cases where no settlement was arrived at the conciliation proceedings terminated when the report of the Conciliation Officer was received by the appropriate Government and not on the expiry of 14 days from the commencement of the proceedings.
The commencement and termination of conciliation proceedings were determined by section 20 and not by section 12(6).
The dismissal of the workman was during the pendency of the conciliation proceedings and the appellants were guilty under section 31(1) of the Act.

B. Sen, P. L. Juneja, R. N. Sachthey and section P. Nayer, for the appellant.
Sardar Bahadur and Yougindra Khushalani, for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, C.J.
The judgment, reproduced below, was drafted by the late Mr. Justice Roy and we all had subscribed to it.
We beard the matter formally again on November 19, 1971.
We adopt the judgment as our own.
448 This is an appeal by the Union of India by way of special leave.
On April 9, 1959, the Central Government directed removal from service of Capt. section K. Rao under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.
The facts leading to his removal are as follows : Rao was a commissioned officer in the Indian Army and was attached to the Army Ordnance Corps Training Centre, Secundrabad.
It was alleged that on April 4, 1958, he committed acts of .gross misconduct.
The allegations were as follows : ""Knowing Kumari Prakash as the daughter of a brother Officer, Rao assisted her in going away from her parents protection and planning to run away with a sepoy. "" ""Rao, by threatening to cause harm to Kumari Prakash 's parents, intimidated her t o visit his house where he took her in his scooter to the unit lines of 51 1 1 Gurkha Rifles where he arranged her meeting with a sepoy of the unit."" ""He (i.e. Rao) acquiesced in the girl being met by the sepoy later at a tea shop nearby where she received a present of a sari and blouse from the sepoy in his presence."" ""Rao thus actively abetted in the attempt of brother officer 's daughter elope with a sepoy."" ""Rao then took Kumari Prakash to a hotel ""Saidya Lodge ' in Hyderabad and got a room to themselves by impersonating and giving a false identity as ""Mr. & Mrs. Prakash"".
An inquiry into the matter was made by Court of Inquiry.
The Chief of the Army Staff, after going through the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry, considered that the conduct of Capt.
Rao was most unbecoming of an officer.
As he was of opinion that trial of the officer by a General Court Martial was inexpedient, he ordered administrative action to be taken under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.
By memorandum dated September 4, 1958, Rao was called upon to submit his explanation by way of defence regarding the allegations against him.
The explanation of Rao was placed before the Central Government.
The Central Government found it to be unsatisfactory, and on April 9, 1959, an order was passed removing the respondent from service.
Rao thereupon filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for quashing the order of removal from service on the 449 ground, inter alia, that r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954, was ultra vires the , and that the action taken thereunder was without any authority.
In the petition Rao gave a somewhat different version of what had happened.
According to him he did not assist Kumari Prakash to go away from her parents ' house.
At the hearing of the petition the only point which was urged was the validity of r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.
If this rule was intra vires the , Rao has no case.
The Army Rules, 1954, including r. 14, were framed in exer cise of the powers conferred by section 191 of the .
Rule 14 of the Army Rules, 1954, is as follows: ""(1) When after considering the reports on an officer 's misconduct, the Central Gove rnment is satisfied or the C in C is of the opinion, that the trial of the officer by a court martial is inexpedient or impracticable but considers the further retention of the said officer in the service as undesirable, the C in C shall communicate the view of the Central Government or his views, as the case may be, to the officer together with all reports adverse to him and he shall be called upon to submit his explanation and defence.
(2) In the event of the explanation of the officer being considered unsatisfactory by the ""C in C, or when so directed by the Central Government, the case shall be submitted to the Central Government with the officer 's defence and the recommendation of the C in C as to whether the officer should be, (a) dismissed from the service; or (b) removed from the service; or (c) called upon to retire; or (d) called upon to resign.
(3) The Central Government, after due consideration of the reports, the officer 's defence, if any, and the recommendation of the C in C, may dismiss or remove the officer with or without pension or call upon him to retire or resign, and on his refusing to do so, the officer may be retired from or gazetted out of the service on pension or gratuity, if any admissible to him."" Under the aforesaid r. 14, action can be taken for misconduct against an officer whose further retention in service is not considered desirable.
without the officer being tried by a court martial.
450 Before removal he must, under the rule, be asked to submit his explanation and defence.
If the explanation is found to be unsatisfactory, the Central Government has been given the power to dismiss or remove the officer.
Rules are framed under section 191 of the .
Sub section (1) of section 191 gives power to the Central Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act.
Sub section 2(a) provides : ""Without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by sub section (1), the rules made thereunder may provide for (a) the removal, retirement, release or discharge from the service of persons subject to this Act."" Sections 18 & 19 which appear in Ch.
IV of the dealing with ""Conditions of Service"" provide as follows : S.18 ""Every person subject to this Act shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.
"" section 19 ""Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder the Central Government may dismiss, or remove from the service, any person subject to this Act.
"" Offenses under the have been dealt with in sections 34 to 70 in Ch.
VI, of which section 45 is as follows : section 45 ""Any officer, junior commissioned officer or warrant officer who behaves in a manner unbecoming his position and the character expected of him shall, on conviction by court martial, if he is an officer, be liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned; and, if he is a junior commissioned officer or a warrant officer, be liable to be dismissed or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned,"" It was argued by counsel for the respondent Rao that the contained specific provisions for punishment for unbecoming conduct, viz. section 45.
To give power to the Central Government to remove an officer without being tried and convicted by court martial was in derogation of section 45 of the .
Rule 14, therefore, was ultra vires the .
This argument is not correct.
Section 19 itself suggests that there should be rules, and subject to the provisions of the Act and such rules, the Central Government may dismiss or remove from the service any person 451 subject to the .
Section 191 (2) (a) specifically gives.
power to make a rule providing for the removal from the service of persons subject to the Act.
It follows that there may be a valid rule where under, subject to the other provisions of the Act, the Central Government may remove a person from the service.
Rule 14 is such a rule : it is, therefore, not ultra vires.
It was argued that the words ""subject to the provisions of this Act"" occurring in section 19 makes section 19 subject to section 45, and the Central Government has thus no power to remove a person from the service in derogation of the provisions of section 45.
But the power under section 19 is an independent power.
Although section 19 uses the words ""subject to the provisions of this Act"", it speaks of removal of a person from the service.
Section 45 provides that on conviction by court martial an officer is liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in this Act mentioned.
For removal from service under section 19 of the read with r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954, a court martial is not necessary.
The two sections 19 and 45 of the Act are, therefore, mutually exclusive.
The result is that r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954, is not ultra vires the .
The appeal is, therefore, allowed; but in the circumstances of the case without any order as to costs.
The case will now go back to the High Court for disposal on merits on the other questions raised by the respondent herein in the High Court.
V.P.S. Appeal allowed.
","The respondent, a commissioned officer in the Indian Army, was found to have committed acts of gross misconduct by a Court of Inquiry.
The Chief of the Army Staff was of the opinion that his trial by a General Court Martial was inexpedient, and the respondent was removed from service after following the procedure under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.
On the question whether r. 14, which gives power to the Central Government to remove an officer without being tried and convicted by Court Martial was in derogation of section 45, , which specifically provides for conviction by court martial and punishment for unbecoming conduct, HELD : The rule is not ultra vires.
[451 D] (1) Section 19 of the Act provides that subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder the Central Government may remove from service, any person subject to the Act.
Therefore, the section itself suggests that there should be rules regarding removal from service, and section 191 (2) (a) of the Act specifically gives power to make a rule providing for the removal from the service of persons subject to the Act.
[450 H; 451 A B] (2) Although section 19 uses the words ""subject to the provisions of this Act"", the section is not subject to section 45.
The power under section 19 is independent of the power under section 45, because, while section 19 speaks of removal of a person, section 45 provides that on conviction by Court Martial an officer is liable to be cashiered or to suffer such less punishment as is in the Act mentioned.

2727,"Appeal No. 1671 of 1966.
Appeal from the judgment and decree dated March 31, 1965 of the Madras High Court in Appeal No. 276 of 1962.
M.K. Ramamurthi, Vineet Kumar, L Ramamurthy and Shyamala Pappu, for the appellant.
A.V. Rangam, for the respondents.
425 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J.
This appeal is brought by certificate from the judgment of the Madras High Court dated March 31, 1965 in A.S. No. 276 of 1962.
The appellant 'brought the suit in O.S. No. 3 of 1961 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Nagapattinam for setting aside the order dated May 10, 1960 of respondent No. 1 the Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, Madras who had affirmed earlier the order of the second respondent, the Deputy Commissioner, holding that the trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil in Manjakollai village was not hereditary.
The appellant was elected as a trustee by the Sengunatha Mudaliars of Manjakollai village at a meeting held on June 27, 1957.
According to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and is affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple.
The appellant said that the temple was declared as an ""exempted"" temple under the provisions of Madras Act 1 of 1925.
The case of the appellant was that the trusteeship of the temple was ""hereditary"".
The respondents, however, took a different view and proceeded on the basis that trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil was not hereditary.
The Subordinate Judge held that the appellant was a hereditary trustee and the suit was not barred by limitation.
The respondents took the matter in appeal to the Madras High Court which by its judgment dated March 31, 1965 allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Subordinate Judge Nagapattinam.
Section 6, sub section
(9) of Madras Act 19 of 1951 states: ""In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context (9) 'hereditary trustee ' means the trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office devolves by hereditary right or is regulated by usage or is specifically provided for by the founder, so long as such scheme of succession is in force;"" This Act has been substituted by Madras Act 22 of 1959 but the definition of the trustee is identical in both the Acts.
The question to be considered in this appeal is whether the appellant is a hereditary trustee Within the meaning of the section.
The definition includes three types of cases: (1) succession to the office of trusteeship devolving by hereditary right; (2) succession 426 to such office being regulated by usage; and (3) succession being specifically provided for by the founder on condition that the scheme of such succession is still in force.
It is not the case of the appellant that the trustees of the temple of the Kumaran Koil are hereditary trustees because their office ' devolves by hereditary right or because succession to that office is specifically provided for by the founder.
The contention on behalf of the appellant is that the succession is ""regulated by usage"".
It was said that according to the usage of the temple the trustees were elected for a period of one year each at a meeting of the members of the Sangunatha Mudaliar Community and so the appellant must be held to be a trustee within the meaning of section 6(9) of Act 19 of 1951.
In our opinion, there is no warrant for this argument.
The phrase ""regulated by usage"" in section 6(9) of the Act must be construed along with the phrase ""succession to this office"" and when so construed that part of the definition would only apply where the ordinary rules of succession under the Hindu law are modified by usage and succession has to be determined in accordance with the modified rules.
The word ""succession"" in relation to property and rights and interests in property generally implies ""passing of an interest from one person to another"" (vide in Re: Hindu Women 's Right to Property Act, 1941 (1).
It is now well established that the office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property.
This is so whether the trustee has a beneficial interest of some sort or not (see Ganesh Chunder Dhur vs Lal Behary(2) and Bhabatarini vs Ashalata(3).
Ordinarily a shebaitship or the office of dharmakartha is vested in the heirs of the founder unless the ,founder has laid down a special scheme of succession or except when usage or custom to the contrary is proved to exist.
Mukherjea J., in Angurbala Mullick vs Debabrata Mullick(4) delivering the judgment of this Court observed: ""Unless therefore, the founder has disposed of the shebaitship in any particular manner and this right of disposition is inherent in the founder or except when usage or custom of a different nature is proved to exist, shebaitship like any other species of heritable property follows the line of inheritance from the founder."" In the case of mutts, whose heads are often celibates and sometimes sanyasins, special rules of succession obtain by custom and usage.
In Sital Das vs Sant Ram(5) the law was taken as wellsettled that succession to mahantship of a mutt or religious institution is regulated by custom or usage of the particular institution except where the rule of succession is laid down by the founder himself who created the endowment.
In that case the custom in (1) (2) 63 I. A. 448.
(3) 70 I.A. 57.
(4) ; ,5, (5) A.LR.
1954 S.C. 606.
427 matters of succession to mahantship was that the assembly of bairagis and worshippets of the temple appointed the successor; but the appointment had to be made from the disciples of the deceased mahant if he left any, and failing disciples, any one of his spiritual kindred.
Such a succession was described as not hereditary in the sense that on the death of an existing mahant, his chela does not succeed to the office as a matter of course, because the successor acquires a right only 'by appointment and the authority to appoint is vested in the assembly of the bairagis and the worshippets.
In Sri Mahant Paramanda Das Goswami vs Radhakrishna Das(1) the Madras High Court took the view that where succession to the mahantship is by nomination by the holder in office, it was not a hereditary succession.
In that case Venkatasubba Rao, J. said: ""If the successor owes his title to nomination or appointment, that is, his succession depends on the volition of the last incumbent and does not rest upon independent title, I am inclined to the view that the office cannot be said to be hereditary."" Krishnan J., stated as follows: ""Where succession is by nomination by the holder in office of his successor it seems to be impossible to contend that it is a hereditary succession.
Hereditary succession is succession by the heir to the deceased under the law, the office must be transmitted to the successor according to some definite rules of descent which by their own force designate the person to succeed.
There need be no blood relationship between the deceased and his successor but the right of the latter should not depend upon the choice of any individual.
"" It is true that the artificial definition of hereditary trustee in section 6(9) of the Act would include even such cases.
But the election to the office of trustee in the present case is for a fixed period of one year and not for life.
It is, therefore, difficult to hold that the office of the appellant is hereditary within the meaning of section 6(9) of the Act.
It is not possible to say that there is a succession of As office to another when on the efflux of the period for which A was appointed, there is a vacancy and B is elected to that vacancy.
It is quite possible that for that vacancy A himself might be reelected because a retiring trustee is eligible for reelection.
The possibility of A being the successor A himself is not merely an anomaly, it is an impossible legal position.
No man can succeed to his own office.
In Black 's Law Dictionary the word 'succession ' is defined as follows: ""The revolution of title to property under the law of descent and distribution.
(1) 428 The right by which one set of men may, by succeeding another set, acquire a property in all the goods, movables, and other chattels of a corporation.
The fact of the transmission of the rights, estate, obligations, and charges of a deceased person to his heir or heirs.
"" The view we have taken is borne out by the reasoning of the Madras High Court in State of Madras vs Ramakrishna(1).
For these reasons we hold that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.
V.P.S. Appeal dismissed.
","The appellant was elected as a trustee of a temple for one year.
The temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of the community and according to the usage of the temple, the trustees were elected for one year, at a meeting of the members of the community.
On the question whether the appellant has a hereditary trustee, because he was, under section 6(9) of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951, the 'trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office is regulated by usage ', HELD: The phrase 'succession to whose office is regulated by usage ' would only apply when the ordinary rules of succession under the Hindu law are modified by usage, and succession has to be determined in accordance with the modified rules.
The office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property.
Succession in relation to property implies passing of an interest from one person to another.
[428 C D] In the present case, the election to the office was for a fixed period of one year.
In such a case, it is not possible to say there is a succession to the office, because: (a) on the efflux of the period for which one trustee is appointed, there is a vacancy and another is elected to that vacancy, and (b) since there is a possibility of the same trustee being reelected, an impossible legal position arises in which a person could be a successor of himself.

1778,"Appeal No. 251 of 1963.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 20, 1957, of the Patna High Court in Civil Revision No. 40 of 1956.
M. C. Setalvad, and R. C. Prasad, for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
March 24, 1964.
The short question which arises in this appeal is whether the term ""wages"" as defined by section 2(vi) of the (No. 4 of 1936) (hereinafter called 'the Act ') includes wages fixed by an award in an industrial dispute between the employer and his employees.
This question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2(vi) before it was amended in 1958.
The subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2(vi) (a) that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court, would be included in the main definition under section 2(vi).
The point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.
It is common ground that between the appellant, Sasamusa Sugar Works Ltd., and its workmen, the respondents, an award had been made by an Industrial Tribunal fixing the pay of the employees at Rs. 2/2/ per day, and in pursuance of the said award, the management of the appellant had entered into an agreement with the respondents that effect would be given to the wage structure, prescribed by the said award.
This agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.
In spite of the award and the agreement, the appellant paid its employees only As.
/ 10 / per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
The respondents contended before the payment of wages authority that the refusal of the appellant to pay to them wages at the rate awarded, in substance, amounted to an illegal deduction from their wages and on that basis, they asked for an order from the authority directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the said prescribed wages.
The appellant raised two pleas against the respondents ' claim.
It urged that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable, because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi) and it also argue,, that the claim of the respondents was barred by limitation.
421 The authority has found that section 2(vi) includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal, and so, it has rejected the appellants ' contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.
In regard to the question of 'limitation, the authority did not decide the said question as a preliminary question, because it held, and, in our opinion, rightly, that it was a mixed question of fact and law, and so, it had to be tried after recording evidence.
The appellant challenged the correctness of the conclusion of the authority that the applications made by the res pondents were competent under section 15 of the Act before the Patna High Court by filing a petition under article 226 of the Constitution.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case, because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2(vi) of the Act.
On that view, the writ petition filed by the appellant was dismissed.
It is this order which the appellant seeks to challenge before us by its present appeal by special leave.
Section 2(vi) as it stood at the relevant time, provides, inter alia, that wages means all remuneration, capable of being expressed in terms of money, which would, if the terms of the ,contract of employment, express or implied, were fulfilled, be payable.
Mr. Setalvad for the appellant contends that before it is held that the wages prescribed by the award fall under section 2(vi), it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment, either express or implied.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied; but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment, and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment, the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2(vi).
That, in brief, is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
We are not inclined to hold that even under the unamended definition of wages, rates of remuneration prescribed by an award could not be included.
In dealing with the question of construing the unamended definition of the term ""wages"", it is essential to bear in mind the scope and character of the powers conferred on Industrial 'Tribunals when they deal with industrial disputes under the provisions of the Indus trial Disputes Act.
It is now well settled that unlike ordinary civil courts which are bound by the terms of contract between the parties when they deal with disputes arising between them in respect of the said terms, Industrial adjudication is not bound to uphold the terms of contract between the employer and the employees.
If it is shown to the satisfaction of Industrial adjudication that the terms of contract of employment, 422 for instance, need to be revised in the interests of social justice. it is at liberty to consider the matter, take into account all relevant factors and if a change or revision of the terms appears to be justified, it can, and often enough it does, radically change the terms of the contract of employment.
The development of industrial law during the last decade bears testimony to the fact that on references made under section 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, terms of employment have constantly been examined by industrial adjudication and wherever it appeared appropriate to make changes in them, they have been made in accordance with the well recognised principles of fair play and justice to both the parties.
Therefore the basic assumption made by Mr. Setalvad in contending that section 2(vi) cannot take in the wages prescribed by the award, is not well founded.
When an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure, in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award.
In a sense, the latter wage structure must be deemed to be a contract between the parties, because that, in substance, is the effect of industrial adjudication.
The true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made, the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted for them.
That being so, it is difficult to accede to the argument that the wages prescribed by the award cannot be treated as wages under section 2(vi) of the Act before it was amended.
The amendment has merely clarified what, in our opinion, was included in the unamended definition itself.
In this connection,we may incidentally refer to the decision of this Court in the South Indian Bank Ltd. vs A. R. Chacko(1), where it has been observed by this Court that the very purpose for which industrial adjudication has been given the peculiar authority and right of making new contracts between employers and workmen makes it reasonable to think that even though the period of operation of the award and the period for which it remains binding on the parties may elapse in respect of both of which special provisions have been made under sections 23 and 29 respectively the new contract would continue to govern the relations between the parties till it is replaced by another contract.
This observation clearly and emphatically bring out that the terms prescribed by an award, in law, and in substance, constitute a fresh contract between the parties.
This question appears to have been considered by the Bombay and the Calcutta High Courts.
In Jogendra Nath (1) A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 15.
423 Chatterjee and Sons vs Chandreswar, Singh(1), the Calcutta High Court appears to have taken the view which supports Mr. Setalvad 's argument, whereas in the Modern Mills Ltd. vs V. R. Mangalvedhkar(2), and in V. B. Godse, Manager, Prabha Mills Ltd., vs R. M. Naick, Inspector, under the Payment of Wages Act(3), the Bombay High Court has interpreted section 2(vi) to include wages directed to be paid by industrial adjudication.
In our opinion, the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
The result is, the appeal fails and is dismissed.
The matter will now go back to the authority under the Act for disposal in accordance with law.
There would be no order as to costs.

","In pursuance of an award made by an Industrial Tribunal fixing the pay of the employees at Rs. 2/2/ per day, the management of the appellant had entered into an agreement with its workmen, that the effect would be given to the wage structure prescribed by the said award.
In spite of the award and the agreement, the appellant paid its employees only As.
/10/ per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act.
They asked for an order from the payment of wages authority directing the appellant to pay the said prescribed wages.
Against the respondent 's claim it was urged by the appellant that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable, because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2(vi) of the Act.
The authority rejected the appellant 's contention.
The appellant then challenged the correctness of the conclusion of the authority before the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution.
The High Court dismissed the writ petition and affirmed the finding of the authority.
It held that section 15 was applicable to the case, because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2(vi) of the Act.
On appeal by Special Leave the appellant contended that before it is held that the wages prescribed by the award fall under section 2(vi), it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment, either express of implied.
Held: The argument is not well founded.

3292,"Civil Appeal No. 159 of 1974.
From the Judgment and Order dated 4 4 1973 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in R.S.A. No. 1482 of 1961.
488 N. N. Goswamy and Arvind Minocha, for the appellant.
Kapil Sibbal and D. Probir Mitra, for respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MATHEW, J.
This is an appeal by special leave against a decree passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana holding that the appeal filed by the plaintiff appellant has abated and dismissing his suit.
The appellant brought the suit on the allegation that there was one Shiromani Nirankari Dera at Patiala, that this institution had two branches one at Landeke in Moga Tehsil and the other at Nanga Kheri in the erstwhile Patiala State, and that he, as mahant in charge of the Shiromani Dera at Patiala had the right to manage the properties attached to the Dera at Landeke.
The prayer in the plaint was for recovery of possession of the Dera and the properties attached to it.
Som Dass, the defendant, contended that the Dera at Landeke was an independent Dera and that he was in possession of the properties of the Dera as its lawfully appointed mahant.
The trial court decreed the suit.
In appeal by the defendant the decree was reversed.
Against that decree, an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
While the appeal was pending in the High Court, Som Dass, the defendant, died on 13 10 1970.
No application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.
An application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.
The correctness of the date of death of Som Dass was contested by Shiam Dass.
The High Court referred the question to the trial Court for enquiry and decision.
The trial Court, after taking evidence, found that Som Dass died on 13 10 1970.
Thereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.
The High Court found no substance in the plea that the appellant had no knowledge about the date of the death of Som Dass and held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement.
The appellant had raised an alternative contention before the High Court that there was no abatement of the appeal even if Som Dass was not impleaded within the period prescribed as he claimed to represent the dera as its duly elected Chela.
The High Court held that after the death of Som Dass, Shiam Dass, as his Chela ""inherited the sum total of the rights which earlier vested in Som Dass and when a controversy is raised about such rights, then the appellant was bound to bring on record the legal representatives of the deceased within the time prescribed by law.
"" 489 We do not think that the view of the High Court was correct.
The suit was filed on the basis that the appellant as the lawfully appointed mahant was entitled to manage the properties of the Dera at Landeke, that the defendant was unlawfully claiming to be the mahant of the Dera and entitled to manage the properties of the Dera, and that the appellant was entitled to be in possession of the properties.
As already stated the contention of the defendant was that though the properties belonged to the Dera, he was its lawfully appointed mahant and that the appellant had no right to recover possession of the property of the Dera.
When Som Dass died, the interest which was the subject matter of the suit, devolved upon Shiam Das as he was elected to be the Mahant of the Dera and the appeal could be continued under Q. 22, r. 10, of the Civil Procedure Code against the person upon whom the interest had devolved.
Order 22, rule 10 reads: ""R. 10(1) In other cases of an assignment, creation or devolution of any interest during the pendency of suit, the suit may, by leave of the Court, be continued by or against the person to or upon whom such interest has come or devolved.
(2) The attachment of a decree pending an appeal there from shall be deemed to be an interest entitling the person who procured such attachment to the benefit of sub rule (1).
"" This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative, the rule that has to be applied is Order 22, rule 10 and not rule 3 or 4, whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
Order 22, rule 10, is not confined to devolution of interest of a party by death, it also applies if the head of the mutt or manager of the temple resigns his office or is removed from office.
In such a case the successor to the head of the mutt or to the manager of the temple may be substituted as a party under this rule.
The word 'interest ' which is mentioned in this rule means interest in the property i.e., the subject matter of the suit and the interest is the interest of the person who was the party to the suit.
It was, however, contended on behalf of the respondent that there was no devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit on the death of Som Dass, since there was no certainty as to the person who would be elected as mahant to succeed him.
The argument was that it was uncertain on the death of Som Dass as to who would become the mahant by election, that it was only when a person succeeded to the mahantship on the death of a previous mahant by virtue of law 490 or custom that there would be devolution of interest in the subject matter of the suit and, therefore, Order 22, rule 10, would not be attracted.
We see no force in this argument.
We are of the view that devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when Shiam Dass was elected as mahant of the Dera after the death of Som Dass.
Som Dass was sued in his capacity as a person who claimed (though illegally according to the appellant) as mahant of the Dera.
Som Dass contended that he was lawfully appointed as mahant of the Dera.
He never set up any claim which was adverse to the Dera or its properties.
The suit against Som Dass was not in his personal capacity but in his capacity as de facto mahant.
In other words, the suit was for possession and management of the Dera and the properties appertaining to it by the appellant purporting to be the de jure mahant against Som Dass as de facto mahant.
The fact that it was after Som Dass died that Shiam Dass was elected to be the mahant of the Dera can make no difference when we are dealing with the question whether the interest in the subject matter of the suit devolved upon him.
The subject matter of the suit was the interest of Som Dass in the Dera and its properties and it devolved upon shiam Dass by virtue of his election as mahant subsequent to the death of Som Dass.
And, as it was in a representative capacity that Som Dass was sued and as it was in the same representative capacity that the appeal was sought to be continued against Shiam Dass, Order 22, rule 10 will apply(1).
In Thirumalai vs Arunachella (2) the Court held that a succeeding trustee of a trustee who filed a suit and thereafter died during its pendency was not legal representative of the predecessor in office.
The Court said that where some of the trustees die or retire during the pendency of a suit and new persons are elected to fill their place, it is a case of devolution of interest during the pendency of a suit and the elected persons can be added as parties under Order 22, rule 10 notwithstanding that the period of limitation for impleading them had expired.
In Roshan Lal vs Kapur Chand the Court took the view that newly appointed trustees are not legal representatives of the trustees who had filed the suit and thereafter died during the pendency of the suit, that they can be added as parties under Order 22, rule 10 notwithstanding the fact that the period of limitation for an application to 491 impleaded them under Order 22, rule 3 had elapsed.
The Court said (at p. 384): ""Such an application is obviously not an application under O. 22, R. 3 Civil Procedure Code.
"" We also see no reason why the High Court should not have granted leave to the appellant to prosecute the appeal.
In the result we reverse the decree of the court below and direct the High Court to dispose of the appeal on merits.
We allow the appeal but, in the circumstances, make no order as to costs.
V.P.S. Appeal allowed.
","The appellant filed the suit on the basis that as the Mahant of a Dera he was entitled to possession and management of the properties of its branch Dera.
The defendant contended that it was an independent Dera and that he was in possession of the properties as its lawfully appointed Mahant.
The trial court decreed the suit but in appeal the decree was reversed.
While the second appeal, preferred by the appellant, was pending in the High Court, the defendant died.
As the application to implead the elected successor of the defendant was filed beyond the period prescribed for an application under O. 23, rr. 3 and 4, the High Court held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement.
In appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that even if the Chela, who had been elected as the Mahant on the death of the defendant, was not impleaded within the period prescribed, there would be no abatement, because he represented the Dera.
Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: (1) When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative, the rule that has to be applied is O. 22, r. 10 and not O. 22, rr. 3 or 4, whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
The word 'interest ' in the rule means interest in the property, i.e., the subject matter of the suit, and the interest is the interest of the person who was the party to the suit.
This rule is based on the principle that the trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit.
The suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
[489F G] In the present case, when the defendant died, the interest which was the subject matter of the suit devolved upon his successor elected as the Mahant of the Dera, and therefore, the appeal could be continued under O. 22 r. 10, C.P.C. [489B C] (2) Though it was uncertain on the death of the defendant as to who would become the Mahant by election, it would not make any difference for the application of O. 22, r. 10.
The devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when the new Mahant was elected.
The suit was for possession and management of the Dera and the properties appertaining to it by the appellant purporting to be the de jure Mahant against the defendant as a de facto Mahant.
The subject matter of the suit was the interest of the defendant in the Dera and its properties and it devolved upon the new Mahant by virtue of his election subsequent to the death of the defendant.
As it was in a representative capacity that he defendant was sued and that it was in the same representative capacity that the appeal was sought to be continued against the new Mahant, O. 23, r. 10 will apply.

4451,"ivil Appeal No. 196 of 1 970.
From the judgment and decree dated April 21, 1969 of the Allahabad High Court in First Appeal No. 80 of 1964.
S.T. Desai, A.T.M. Sampath, Mukul Mudgal and Raju Ramachandran for the Appellants.
R.K. Garg, Mrs. Urmila Sirur and Shiv Pujan Singh, for the Respondents.
(b) of clause (I) of Article 133 of the Constitution granted by the Allahabad High Court against its judgment and decree dated April 21, 1969 disposing of appeals out of a suit for declaration and possession.
The plaintiffs filed a suit claiming that the property in dispute belonged to the Math Sauna or the deity Sri Thakur Gokarneshwar 661 Mahadeo Ji installed in the Math Sauna temple, and that Mahant Sadashiva Yati was in possession as Mahant and Sarbarakar.
It was claimed that in the event of Mahant Sadashiva Yati being found out of possession a decree for possession should be made.
Sadashiva Yati pleaded that on the death of Mahant Shivshanker Yati he was elected Mahant of Math Sauna and was, therefore, entitled as Sarbarakar to all the properties recorded in the deity Mahadeo Ji or in the name of Mahant Shivshanker Yati.
These properties included properties in village Amauli.
He asserted that Shivshanker Yati possessed no personal property.
The suit was contested by the first defendant, Kedar Nath Chaubey, also referred to as Uma Shanker Yati.
He alleged that Mahant Shivshanker Yati owned personal properties which included the properties in village Amauli, that he was the chela of Mahant Shivshanker Yati and the Amauli properties had passed to him under a will executed by the Mahant.
We are concerned in this appeal solely with the Amauli properties.
Math Sauna is an old Math situated in the village of that name in Tehsil Saidpur in the district of Ghazipur.
One of the earliest Mahants of the Math Mahant Gokaran Yati, raised a temple in the premises of the Math and installed a deity acclaimed by the name of ""Gokarneshwar Mahadeo"".
On his death he was succeeded by Mahant Shivbaran Yati, who executed a waqf deed on November 12, 1892 dedicating various properties to the deity with the intent that arrangements for bhog, deepdan and other expenses be met from them.
The surplus, the deed directed was to be employed for acquiring further property in the name of the deity and was not to be applied by the Sarbarakar to his personal use.
The learned Civil Judge decreed the suit but included a finding in his judgment that Sadashiv Yati was not a regularly constituted Mahant of Math Sauna and Sarbarakar of the deity.
Two appeals were filed in the High Court.
First Appeal No. 80 of 1964 was filed by Kedar Nath Chaubey @ Uma Shanker Yati against the declaration that the Amauli properties were owned by Math Sauna or the deity and that Sadashiv Yati was in possession thereof as Mahant and Sarbarakar.
The other appeal, First Appeal No. 270 of 1965 was filed by the plaintiffs for the relief that Sadashiv Yati was a properly constituted Mahant of Math Sauna and Sarbarakar of the deity.
The High Court allowed both the appeals by its judgment and decree dated April 21, 1969.
It held that the Amauli properties had been purchased by Shivshanker Yati in 1921 from 662 the personal and separate funds inherited by him from his predecessor Shivpher Yati, and that the Amauli properties must, therefore, be regarded as his personal and separate properties and they did not belong to the Math or the deity.
The present appeal is directed against that part of the judgment and decree of the High Court.
It is admitted between the parties that the Amauli properties were purchased by Mahant Shivshankar Yati for Rs. 40,000 forming part of a fund left behind by his predecessor Mahant Shivpher Yati.
The point for decision is whether the fund was the personal property of Mahant Shivpher Yati, and if so, whether it devolved on Mahant Shivshankar Yati.
The Mahants and members of Math Sauna belonged to the Dashnami Sanyasi sect.
The material on the record establishes that they could own and possess personal property.
They included sanyasis who had formerly been married men and householders, men who had passed through the grihastha ashram.
Some of them continued to possess and even to acquire personal property after taking sanyas.
It was observed in Sushil Chandra Sen vs Gobind Chandra Das(l) that Dashnami sanyasis mixed freely in the business world and carried on trade and often accumulated property.
This Court in Gurcharan Prasad vs Krishnanand (2) affirmed that Nihang Dashnami Sanyasis could pursue money lending business and could own property as absolute owners, and enjoy them as their personal property.
That certain sects of sanyasis could acquire personal property was accepted by that eminent Judge, Dr. B.K. Mukherjee, in his ""Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trusts"",(a) where he says: ""A Mohunt, and for the matter of that, any other Sanyasi can acquire personal property of his own.
The Pronamis given to a Mohunt are generally his personal property.
The mere fact that a Mohunt is an ascetic does not raise any presumption that a property in his possession is not his personal property.
Strictly speaking, there is no presumption either one way or the other, and in each case the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish that the properties in respect of which he is asking for possession are properties to the possession of which he is entitled in the right in which he sues"".
663 There is reason to believe that Mohant Shivbaran Yati, Mohant Shivpher Yati and Mahant Shivshankar Yati were not celibates and had been grihasthas, and were entitled to possess, enjoy and acquire personal property.
The evidence discloses that Mahant Shivpher Yati was held in high regard on account of his personal learning and attainments, and has a large number of chelas including many affluent persons from whom he received personal bhents or pranamis of large amounts of money.
His personal property, on his death, included cash, sovereigns and gold besides two fixed deposits with the Bank of Bengal of Rs. 45,000.
He had also inherited the personal property of Mahant Shivbaran Yati, who owned three private properties in village Shiv Dass in the district of Banaras.
On his death in 1917, all those properties and wealth devolved on Mahant Shivshankar Yati.
He was granted a succession certificate by the District Judge, Ghazipur in respect of the two fixed deposits made by Mahant Shivpher Yati in the Bank of Bengal.
Mahant Shivshankar Yati employed the inherited money in the purchase of two properties in village Amauli in 1921 paying Rs 30,000 for a full interest in one property and Rs. 10,000 for a moiety share in the other.
In respect of both properties, the revenue records mentioned the name of Mahant Shivshankar Yati and not that of the Math or the deity.
Small parcels of these properties were transferred by Mahant Shivshankar Yati from time to time, and none of those transfers was challenged by the plaintiffs in the present suit.
It is urged for the appellants that where a nucleus of dedicated property exists, the acquisition of additional property should be attributed to the application of the nucleus and must, therefore, be regarded as property belonging to the Math or the deity.
As has been observed, there can be no presumption either way.
All the facts and circumstances must be taken into consideration and on a balancing of the entire evidence it has to be determined whether the property can be said to belong to the Math or deity or is the personal property of the Mahant, the burden of proof resting on the party who makes the claim.
In the present case, it is difficult to conclude from the material before us that the total income from the properties belonging to the Math and the deity left any appreciable surplus after meeting the expenditure on account of bhog, arpan, deepdan, daily and annual puja and the other obligations specified in the waqf deed.
We are in agreement with the High Court that the fund from which the Amauli properties were acquired constituted the personal property of Mahant Shivpher Yati.
On his 664 death in 1917, the fund passed to Mahant Shivshankar Yati, who in 1921 employed it for the purchase of the Amauli properties.
Mahant Shivshankar Yati executed a will in 1956, and it appears beyond dispute that by virtue of this will the Amauli properties devolved on Uma Shankar Yati.
It is pointed out before us that in assessment proceedings under the U. P. Agriculture Income Tax Act 1948, the Amauli properties were described by Mahant Shivshankar Yati as properties of the Math and therefore a claim to exemption from the levy was made.
The High Court has found that the claim was not accepted by the assessing authority, and that the position in regard to those properties taken in the assessment proceedings was adopted by the Mahant only for the purpose of escaping personal liability to tax.
We concur with that finding.
In our judgment, the High Court is right in the view that the Amauli properties constitute the personal property of Uma Shankar Yati and do not form part of the properties of the Math Sauna or of the deity, Sri Thakur, Gokarneshwar Mahadeoji.
In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
P.B.R. Appeal dismissed.
","The plaintiffs in their suit claimed that the properties in dispute belonged to the Math Sauna temple and that one of the plaintiffs Mahant Sadashiva Yati on the death of his predecessor was elected as Mahant of the temple and that therefore as Sarbarakar he was entitled to all the properties recorded in the name of the deity or his predecessor.
The defendant claimed that by virtue of a will executed by Mahant Shivshankar Yati, the predecessor Mahant, the properties in dispute which were his personal properties devolved on him.
The Civil Judge decreed the plaintiffs ' suit with a finding that Mahant Sadashiv Yati was not the Sarbarakar.
Upholding the respondent 's claim, the High Court in appeal, held that the properties did not belong either to the Math or the deity but were the personal and separate properties of Mahant Shivshankar Yati.
In appeal to this Court the appellants impugned the correctness of the High Court 's view.
Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: The properties in dispute did not form part of the properties of Math Sauna or of the deity but were the personal properties of the respondent.
[664 D E] It is well accepted that certain sects of Sanyasis (such as Dashnami Sanyasis in this case) could acquire personal property of their own and that the pronamis given to a Mahant are generally his personal property.
The mere fact that a Mahant is an ascetic does not raise any presumption that the property in his possession is not his personal property.
There is no presumption either way.
In each case the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish that the properties in respect of which he is asking for possession are properties to which he is entitled.
[662 F G] 660 In the instant case the three earlier Mahants before they took to sanyasa had been grahasthas.
They were entitled to possess, enjoy and acquire personal property.
Mahant Shivpher Yati, one of the predecessor Mahants, whose reputation as a man of learning and personal attainments was high, received personal bhents from many of his affluent chelas.
In addition, on the death of his predecessor Mahant Shivbaran Yati.
Mahant Shivpher Yati inherited his personal property, all of which devolved on Shivshankar Yati.
A succession certificate in respect of these properties was granted in the name of Shivshankar Yati.
The revenue records also showed him as the owner of the properties and not the Math or the deity.
None of the transfers of small parcels of these properties made by Mahant Shivshankar Yati from time to time was challenged by the plaintiffs at any time.
[663 A l] Whether a property was acquired by the application of the nucleus could only be determined after taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of a case and on a balancing of the entire evidence.
The burden of proof rests on the party making the claim.
[663 F G] In the present case there is no material on record to how whether the total income from the properties belonging to the Math and the deity, left any appreciable surplus after meeting the expenditure on bhog and other ceremonies.
The High Court rightly held that the fund from which the properties were acquired constituted the personal property of Mahant Shivpher Yati on whose death Shivshankar Yati employed it for the purchase of the properties and by virtue of his will the properties devolved on the respondent.

From the Judgment and Order dated 26.12.69 of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in W.P. Nos. 3956, 3971, 3983, 3899, 4421, 4474, 4537, 4544, 4570, 4825 and 4933/68.
D.K. Sen, Gopal Subramonium and R.N. Poddar for the Appellant.
Ex parte for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR, J.
In these 11 appeals only that part of the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court is assailed by the Union of India where the challenge to the validity of section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 has succeeded.
The challenge to the other provisions of the Act at the instance of persons engaged in gold trade, i.e, manufacturers, shroffs and dealers in gold was rejected by the High Court.
Section 28 of the Act runs thus: ""28.
Money lending business not to be carried on in licensed premises No licensed dealer shall unless authorised by the Administrator so to do, (a) carry on business as a money lender or banker on the security of any article, or ornament, or both, (b) permit any other person to carry on money lending, banking or any other business, in the same premises in which he carried on business as such dealer.
"" The High Court has struck down the aforesaid provision only on the ground that it suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power inasmuch as no criteria or guide lines have been 954 provided by reference to which the power conferred on the Administrator to refuse permission or grant permission should be exercised and that the section confers an arbitrary, uncanalised power upon the Administrator with the result that the licensed dealer is at his mercy while seeking permission to carry on money lending or banking business on the security of any article, ornament or both in the same premises in which he carried on business as such dealer.
The High Court 's reasoning in this behalf is to be found in its judgment at page 87 of the paper book and it runs thus: ""The Administrator as is evident from this provision, is given unlimited authority or power to refuse permission or to grant permission.
No rules have been framed prescribing the conditions or circumstances under which the Administrator could refuse permission or grant permission.
A dealer is at the mercy of the Administrator and is help less against the arbitrary exercise of the power by the Administrator when he chooses to negative the request.
It is clear that Section 28 confers an arbitrary and uncanalised power without any criteria for guiding the discretion of the Administrator.
Further, the section does not provide nor is any rule brought to our notice which enjoins upon the Administrator to give a hearing to dealer who seeks permission under this Section and give reasons in case he decides to refuse the permission.
"" Incidentally the High Court also proceeded to draw analogy from the reasoning adopted by this Court in its decision in Harakchand Ratanchand Banthias vs Asst.
collector of Central Excise Poona, II Division while declaring sec.
27(6) of the Act, as it stood prior to its amendment by the Amending Act No. 26 of 1969, constitutionally invalid on the ground of conferal of a very wide and vague power upon the Administrator to grant or renew a license to a dealer.
For the reasons which we shall indicate presently it is impossible to the reasoning given by the High Court for striking down sec.
28 in the manner done and in our view the analogy drawn by the High Court from the reasoning adopted by this Court while dealing with unamended sec.
27(6) of the Act is clearly inapplicable.
It is true that no express rule prescribing the conditions or circumstances under which the permission can be granted or refused (1) 955 has been framed nor any particular guide line has been expressly indicated in sec.
28 by reference to which the power conferred upon him thereunder could be exercised by the Administrator, but that is not decisive of the matter.
It cannot be disputed that sec.
28 is part and parcel of the entire scheme of Gold Control as envisaged by the Act and the object of the enactment and the scheme affords sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising his discretion under that section.
The main object in putting the Act on the Statute Book as indicated by its long title is ""to provide, in the economic and financial interests of the community, for the control of the production, manufacture, supply, distribution, use and possession of, and business in, gold ornaments and articles of gold and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
"" In Harakchand Banthria 's case (supra) this Court has further pointed out that even though import of gold into India had been banned considerable quantities of contraband gold were finding their way into the country through illegal channels affecting the national economy and hampering the country 's economic stability and progress, that the Customs Department was not in a position to effectively combat the smuggling over the long borders and coast line, that therefore anti smuggling measures had to be supplemented by a detailed system of control over internal transactions and that the Gold (Control) Act, 1968 was passed for this purpose.
In other words, the several restrictions that have been put on the activities of the traders doing business in gold will have to be viewed from the aforesaid perspective.
It is also clear that the restrictions which have been imposed in sec.
28 are meant to prevent the circumvention of other provisions of the Act.
Therefore, in our view the objective, the policy and the Scheme of the Act together with the necessity to ensure prevention of circumvention of the other provisions of the Act afford more than sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising the power of discretion conferred on him under sec.
In fact, sec.
5(1 of the Act requires that the Administrator should have regard to the policy and purposes of the Act in making his orders.
Moreover against his order under that section a revision lies to Central Government which implies that he will have to make judicious use of his power or discretion and any improper exercise is liable to be corrected by a higher authority.
If that be so it cannot be said that unfettered or uncanalised or arbitrary power has been conferred upon the Administration under sec.
Moreover, regard must be had to be the nature of the restrictions imposed by the Section.
It does not impose any blanket or 956 absolute prohibition upon a dealer from carrying on money lending, banking or any other business in the same premises in which he carries on business as a dealer but he is prevented only from carrying on business as money lender or banker on the security of any article, ornament or both unless authorised by the administrator.
Even the restriction in the case of a third person in carrying on business as a money lender, banker or any other business in the same premises is not absolute in as much as the Administrator can authorise the third person to carry on the business in the licensed premises of the dealer and while implementing such limited restrictions or granting relief against the same he will be guided by the policy and purposes of the Act and by the prime consideration that circumvention of the other provisions of the Act shall not be premitted.
Having regard to this position which obtains in the case sec.
28 cannot be struck down on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative power and its validity has to be upheld.
We may indicate that the same provision (section 28) was challenged before the Patna High Court in Bihar State Bullion Merchants ' Association vs Union of lndia(1) and the Gujarat High Court in Ramanlal Purshottamamdas Chokshi vs Union of India & Others (2) and these High Courts have upheld its validity.
We approve the view taken in those cases As regards the analogy drawn by the High Court from the reasoning adopted by this Court in Harakchand Banthia 's case (supra) while declaring unamended sec.
27(6) of the Act invalid we would like to point out that while conferring power on the Administrator in the matter of granting or renewing a license to a dealer the unamended sec.
27(6) in several of its clauses referred to certain concepts which Administrator was required to take into account, and these concepts were regarded as indefinite, uncertain and vague.
For instance under clause (a) the Administrator was required to have regard to the number of dealers existing 'in the region ' in which the applicant was intending to carry on business as dealer but the word 'region ' was no where defined in the Act; similarly clause (b) required the Administrator to have regard to the anticipated demand ', as estimated by him for the ornaments in that region but the expression 'anticipated demand ' was really vague and incapable of assessment leading to a great deal of uncertainty; similarly the expression (1)AIR 1971 Patna, 240.
(2)14 Guj.
L.R. 112. 957 'suitability of the applicant ' in cl.
(e) and 'public interest ' in cl.
(g) A did not provide any objective standard or norm and because such indefinite, uncertain and vague expressions or concepts had been used in some of the clauses under sec.
27(6) this Court struck down sec.
27(6) on the ground that it conferred a very wide and vague power on the Administrator.
It may be mentioned that after this provision was struck down by this Court Parliament has carried out the necessary amendment in the Act.
No such vague or indefinite expressions or concepts are to be found in sec.
28 by reference to which the Administrator is required to exercise his power.
In the absence of parity of situation or circumstances the doctrine of parity of reasoning cannot be invoked.
In the result we set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and declare sec.
28 of the Act valid.
The appeal succeeds but since the respondents have not appeared there will be no order as to costs.
S.R. Appeal allowed.
","Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 bars money lending business to be carried on in licensed premises, either by the licensed dealer or by any other person unless authorised by the Administrator to do so.
Drawing analogy from the reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court in its decision reported in Harakchand Ratanchand Banthia vs Assistant Collector or Central Excise, Poona, II Division, [1970] I SCR 479=AIR , the High Court of Andhra Pradesh struck down the said provision on the ground that it suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative power in as much, as no criteria or guidelines have been provided by reference to which the power conferred on the Administrator to refuse permission or grant permission should be exercised and that the section confers an arbitrary, uncanalised and unfettered power upon the Administrator with the result that the licensed dealer is at his mercy while seeking permission to carry on money lending or banking business on the security of any article, ornament or both in the same premises in which he carried on business as such dealer.
Hence the appeal by special leave.
Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.1 Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 cannot be struck down on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative power and its validity must be upheld.
[957C] 1.3 It is true that no express rule prescribing the conditions or circumstances under which the permission can be granted or refused has been framed nor any particular guide line has been expressly indicated in section 28 by reference to which the power conferred upon him thereunder could be exercised by the Administrator, but that is not decisive of the matter.
[954H; 955A] 952 1.3 Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 is part and parcel of the entire scheme of the Gold Control Act the objective, the policy and the scheme of the Act together with the necessity to ensure prevention of circumvention of the other provisions of the Act afford more than sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising the power or discretion conferred on him under section 28.
The several restrictions that have been put on the activities of the traders doing business in gold will have to be viewed, in the light of the purpose or which the Gold Control Act was passed viz., that even though import of gold into India had been banned considerable quantities of contraband gold were finding their way into the country through illegal channels affecting the national economy and hampering the country 's economic stability and progress, that the Customs Department was not in a position to effectively combat the smuggling over the long borders and coast line that therefore anti smuggling measures had to be supplemented by a detailed system of control over internal transactions.
In fact section 5 (1) of the Act requires that the Administrator should have regard to the policy and purposes of the Act in making his orders.
Moreover against his order under that section a revision lies to Central Government which implies that be will have to make judicious use of his power or discretion and any improper exercise is liable to be corrected by a higher authority.
Therefore, it cannot be! said that unfettered or uncanalised or arbitrary power has been conferred upon the Administrator under section 28.
1955B; E G] 1.4 further section 28 does not impose any blanket or absolute prohibition upon a dealer from carrying on money lending, banking or any other business in the same promises in which he carries on business as a dealer but he is prevented only from carrying in business as money lender or banker on the security of any article, ornament or both unless authorised by the Administrator.
Even the restriction in the case of a third person in carrying on business as a money lender, banker or any other business in the same premises is not absolute in as much as the Administrator can authorise the third person to carry of the business in the licensed premises of the dealer and while implementing such limited restrictions or granting relief against the same he will be guided by the policy and purposes of the Act and by the prime consideration that circumvention of the other provisions of the Act shall not be permitted.

6852,"(C) No. 677 of 1988.
(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).
P.N. Duda, N. Safaya, P.K. Choudhary and Ms. Rekha Pandey for the Petitioners.
Kapil Sibal, Additional Solicitor General, Ms. A. Subha shini and K. Swamy for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by V. RAMASWAMI, J.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners have questioned the con stitutional validity of Section 5 of the (12 of 1919) (hereinafter called 'the Act ').
The grounds on which the vires of the provisions is attacked are that the section gives an unguided, unchanelised and arbitrary power to the State Government to include any substance as poison for the purpose of restriction to be imposed on the posses sion for sale and sale of the same.
It was further contended that the restriction imposed on possession for sale and sale were not reasonable restrictions.
The petitioner 's have also taken the plea that though the Act is a Central enactment it is possible of unjust and unjustified discriminatory appli cation as it is left to each State Government to determine what substance they would include as poison and regulated and the decision in one State to include the substance as poison is not automatically made applicable to the other States.
The object of the enactment is to regulate the posses sion for sale and the sale, whether wholesale or retail of poisons and the importation of the same.
In other words, it is intended to control over the traffic in poisons.
Though the original enactment, the Poisons Act, 1904 was restrict ed, it was applicable to white arsenic, the expanded its provisions and enabled State Government to declare any substance as poison for the purposes of the Act by a notification under the Act or the rules made under the Act.
In exercise of this power by the Notification No. F. 10/44/72 fin.
(G) dated 7.8.1973 the Lt. Governor of Delhi amended the Delhi Poisons Rules, 1926 (hereinafter called the Rules) by including to the list of substances included in the Rules as ""Poisons"" ""the substance commonly known 222 as 'thinner ' containing spirit and other soluble material such as shellac in which the percentage of such soluble material does not exceed 30%"" as poison and consequential amendment of rules 12 and 13 of the Rules.
It was the con tention of the petitioners before the authorities that their ""unit is manufacturing only those thinners which contain only liquid substance, like as ecotone, ethyl acetate SDS etc.
and not all solubles.
"" According to them, therefore, the substance manufactured by them would not come within the amended Rules.
Though in the beginning the petitioners were contending that in substance manufactured by them did not come within Rule 2(x)(2) and there were some correspondence in this regard, when the competent authority held that the substance manufactured by the petitioners would come within the definition of 'thinner ' as contained in Rule 2(x)(2) of the Rules, the petitioners did not question the finding on any material.
Before us also they had not placed any materi al to show that the finding was wrong or that the substance would not come within Rule 2(x)(2).
In fact the learned counsel argued the petition on the basis that the petition ers are a manufacturer of 'thinner ' within Rule 2(x)(2) which has been declared as poison for purposes of the Act.
Originally the Act contained a schedule in which the list of substances declared as poisons were listed.
Later when Delhi Poisons Rules, 1926 were made in exercise of the powers under the Act those list of substances were included in the list enumerated in Rule 2 thereof.
Rule 2 was amended as already stated including 'thinner ' of the description mentioned therein as poison.
Section 5 of the Act the con stitutional validity of which is questioned reads as fol lows: ""5.
Presumption as to specified poisons: Any substance specified as a poison in a rule made or notification issued under this Act shall be deemed to be a poison for the purpose of this Act.
"" It was a law in force in the territory of India before the commencement of the Constitution and as such continued in force.
The Act is intended to regulate the importation, possession and sale of poisons.
Some substances were includ ed in the Rules made in 1926 as poisons and that is not in dispute.
Section 5 of the Act deals with presumption and states that any substance specified as a poison in a Rule or noti fication issued under the Act shall be deemed to be a 'po ison ' for purposes of the Act.
Rules of 1926 were made in exercise of the rule making power under Section 3 of the Act.
223 That Section enables the State Government to make Rules generally to carry out the purposes and objects of the Act.
Rules were amended in 1973 and duly notified as required by the Act.
Section 2(3) of the , 1/1904 defined poison as: ""Any substance which were applied to the body internally or externally, or in any way intro duced into the system, is capable, without acting mechanically, but by its own inherent qualities,.
or destroying life? When this Act 1/1904 was repealed and re enacted as Poison Act 12 of 1919 the definition was omitted and speci fied substances were included in the schedule with a power vested in the State Government to amend the same by Rules including other substances to the list of poisons.
It is not all poisonous substances that are brought within the regula tion under the Act.
It is those substances which the Govern ment consider its possession for sale or sale to be regulat ed in the interest of health and safety of the society.
This limitation is inherent in the scheme of the Act itself.
Of course no comprehensive definition can be given to the word poison.
Under this term would fall anything calcu lated to destroy life.
Substances harmless in themselves might become poison by the time or manner of their adminis tration.
Nothing is a poison unless regard be had to its administration.
A substance may be a deadly poison or a valuable medicine according to how and how much is taken.
If the resultant effect of administering into the system pro duces a violent, morbid or fatal changes or which destroys living tissues, the substance can be safely called poison.
Section 4 of the Act impliedly sets out certain guidelines when the State can notify a substance as poison.
It states that the State Government may by rule regulate the posses sion of any specified poison in any local area in which the use of such poison for the purpose of committing murder or mischief by poisoning cattle appears to it to be of such frequent occurrence as to render restriction on the posses sion thereof desirable.
Any substance which is used for purposes mentioned therein can definitely be declared as poison.
That is what the Government have done in this case.
It has become a notorious fact, which we can even take judicial notice of, that the substance known as 'thinner ' as it is or mixing with some other substances are taken as intoxicating spirits endangering the life.
In many cases deaths have also occurred due to drinking such substance.
If the Government thought in the circumstances that the posses sion or sale of the same is to be regulated it could not be said that they have no power to regulate.
Section 2 224 also enables the Government by Rule to regulate the posses sion for sale and the sale of the specified poison.
It is in exercise of this power Rule 13 was amended by substituting the old Rule by the following Rule: ""13 (1) All poisons kept for sale by any licence holder under these rules (except those kept by a chemist, druggist or compounder for the purchase of dispensing or compounding in compliance with the prescription of medical or veterinary practitioner) shall be kept in a box, almirah, room or building (according to the quantity maintained), which shall be secured by lock and key and in which no sub stance shall be placed other than poisons, possessed in accordance with a licence granted under the Act, and each poison shall .be kept within such box, almirah, room or building in a separate closed receptacle of glass, metal or earthenware.
Every such box, almirah, room or building and every receptacle shall be marked with the word 'poison ' in red charac ters both English and vernacular and in the case of receptacles containing separate 'poison ' with the name of such 'poison '.
Provided that above rule shall not apply to 'poison ' mentioned in Clause (x) of Rule 2.
(ii) All 'poisons ' mentioned in clause (x) of rule 2 shall be kept in a room or building (according to quantity maintained) which shall be secured by lock and key in a separate receptacle of glass, metal and earthenware etc.
Every such room building and every such receptacle shall be marked with the word 'poison ' in red character both English and vernacular, with the name of the 'poison '.
"" We are not impressed with the argument that any require ment in this Rule is unreasonable or offends the petition ers ' right to carry on any trade or business.
The nature of trade in poison is such that nobody can be considered to have an absolute right to carry on the same.
It is a busi ness which can be termed even as inherently dangerous to health and safety of society in view of the rampant misuse and sale to the poor, weak and helpless as an intoxicant.
A law in such circumstance can regulate the trade.
This posi tion is well settled and it would be pedantic to cite all the authorities of this Court on this point.
It is also not necessary that the same substance should be declared as poison for the entire country.
The notification and its application to any area would depend on the necessity 225 to declare the substance as poison on the particular facts and situation prevailing in that area and the need to regu late the possession and sale in that area.
No question of discrimination can arise in such circumstances.
We are of opinion that the provisions of neither Section 2 nor 5 nor the impugned notification are hit by any consti tutional limitation.
The writ petition accordingly fails and it is dismissed.
Rule nisi is discharged.
No order as to costs.

3436,"ivil Appeal Nos.
630 631 of 1971.
Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated the 19 1 1970 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Tax Revision Cases Nos 46 and 47 of 1969.
V. section Desai, Mrs. Vimla Markandeyulu and G. N. Rao for the Appellant.
P. Ram Reddy and P. P. Rao for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BEG, J.
The short question before us in these appeals by special leave, is whether sales of Arc carbons, known as ""Cinema Arc Carbons"", manufactured by the appellant company, were rightly subjected to sales tax for two assessment years 1965 66 and 1966 77 on the ground that they fall under entry No. 4 of the 1st Schedule of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957, (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act ').
This entry reads as follows: ""Cinematographic equipment, including cameras, projectors, and sound recording and reproducing equipment 562 lenses films and parts and accesories required for use their with As indicated above, the very name of the Arc Carbons, as commercial commodities, seems to attach the word ""Cinema"" to them because of the use to which they are generally put.
The High Court referred to the fact that the appellants had not produced their account books to show that they had been purchased by persons other than those who ran cinemas or for any other use.
Of course, it is very difficult to identify a taxable commodity merely by the use to which it may be put.
Nevertheless, it appears that the entry under consideration links the taxable object with its general or ordinary use.
The taxing authorities were, therefore, compelled to consider the use which is generally made of the arc carbons.
They had concluded that the common or ordinary use of the arc carbons was that they exuded their power foul light cast, through the projectors, on cinema screens.
It was pointed out that the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, the final departmental authority under the Act, had allowed an application for adducing expert evidence to determine the question whether arc carbons manufactured by the appellant company could be covered by the entry under consideration.
It, however, appears that, before further evidence could be taken, at the appellate stage, on the subject, a decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in the State of Andhra Pradesh vs Srimathi Nidmarthi Saraswathi Devi(1), was brought to the notice of the Tribunal.
There, the High Court had held that such arc carbons are covered by the 4th entry in the 1st Schedule of the Act.
Hence, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal without taking further evidence.
In the High Court, two decisions cited on behalf of the appellants were: Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Madhurai Division, Madhurai vs Ravi Auto Stores(2), and State of Madras vs Indian oxygen Ltd. (3).
The High Court pointed out that in both these cases what was decided was whether ""welding electrodes"", considered by themselves, were ""electrical goods"" falling within entry 41 of Schedule 1 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act.
It was held, in these cases, that they were only copper rods which were melted by electrical power in the process of welding.
Neither the use of the term ""electrode"" to describe them, suggesting a connection with electricity, nor their utilisation in a process involving application of electrical power could convert them into ""electrical goods"" as contemplated by the entry in the Madras Act.
The High Court rightly observed that these decisions had no bearing whatsoever upon the very different entry in a schedule of an entirely different Act of a different State.
The same question has been argued before us with the help of some more cases to which the same criticism applies.
The additional cases cited before us were: Pashabhai Patel & Co.(P) Ltd. vs Collector of Sales Tax, Maharashtra State(4), where it was held a ""tractor"" (1) T.R.C. No. 26 of 2962 (decided on 9th August, 1963) (2) (1968) 22 S.T.C. 172 (Madras) (3) (1968) 22 S.T.C. 476 (Madras) (4) (1964) 15 S.T.C.32.
563 is not ""agricultural machinery"", within the meaning of entry 9 in Schedule of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953; Agrawal Brothers vs Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh(1); where it was also held that a ""tractor"", which is ""nothing but a self propelled vehicle capable of pulling a load"", or ""traction"" does not acquire the character of ""agricultural machinery or implement"" merely because when used on agricultural land it is used also to draw certain agricultural implements like a plough; The State of Mysore vs Mores (India) Ltd.(2), where it was held that a typewriter ribbon is not an essential part of a type writer so as to attract the tax under entry 18 of the second schedule to the Mysore Sales Tax, Act, 1957, Commissioner, Sales Tax, U. P. v Free India Cycle Industries(3), where it was held that rexine saddle covers used also for bicycle seats are not covered by entry No. 34 introduced by Section 3A of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948, as modified subsequently, which read: ""bicycles, tricycles, cycle rickshaws and perambulators and parts and accessaries thereof other than tyres and tubes""; The Madhya Pradesh State Co operative Marketing Society, Jabalpur vs The Commissioner of Sales Tax, M.P. Indore(4), where it was held that oil engines and pumps"", which are not known in the commercial world as ""agricultural machinery"" could not be covered by an entry meant for goods sold for agricultural purposes simply because some of them are also sold to agriculturists for agricultural purposes.
We do not think that any useful purpose is served by multiplying cases relating to entries which are so very different and could have only a very remote hearing, if any, upon any reasoning which could be adopted to support the submission that the arc carbons, under consideration here, fall within the relevant entry 4 of Schedule 1 of the Act.
The meaning of this entry can only be satisfactorily determined in the light of the language of the entry itself considered in the context in which it occurs.
The entry No. 4 occurs in a schedule in which descriptions of goods to be taxed indicate that the expression ""required for use there with"" has been employed for equipment or accessories connected with the main purpose.
For instance, in entry No. 5 the expression occurs at the end as follows: ""Photographic and other cameras and enlargers, films and plates, paper and cloth and other parts and accessories required for use therewith"".
Apparently, the deciding factor is the predominant or ordinary purpose or use.
It is not enough to show that the article can be put to other uses also.
It is its general or predominant user which seems to determine the category in which an article will fall.
The first entry in the schedule relates to ""motor vehicles"" and includes ""component parts of motor vehicles"" and ""articles (including batteries) adapted for use as parts and accessories of motor vehicles."" but excludes certain other articles by putting in the words ""not being such articles as are ordinarily also used for other purposes than as (1) (1965) 16 S.T.C. 860.
(2) (1970) 26 S.T.C. 87.
(3) (1970) 26 S.T.C. 428.
(4) (1971) 27 S.T.C. 45.
564 part and accessories of motor vehicles"".
Entry No. 2, relating to refrigerators, air conditioning plants covers also ""component parts thereof"".
Again, entry No. 3, for ""wireless reception instruments and apparatus"" includes ""electrical valves, accumulators, amplifiers and loud speakers and spare parts and accessories thereof ' '.
The words ""parts thereof"" are used in several entries, such as entry No. 6 for clocks, time pieces and watches, entry No. 10 for dictaphones and other similar apparatus for recording sound, and entry No. 11 for sound transmitting equipment such as telephones and loud speakers.
our object in indicating the nature of entries, amdist which entry No. 4 occurs, is to show that some precision has been attempted in making the entries.
When it was intended to confine the entry to particular gadgets and ""parts thereof"" the entry said so.
Of course, even where an entry relates to parts manufactured for use for a particular kind of instrument of gadget only, the article, manufactured to serve as a part of a particular kind of apparatus, would not cease to be covered by the intended entry simply because a purchaser makes some other use of it.
We have to find the intention of the framers of the schedule in making the entry in each case.
The best guide to their intentions is the language actually employed by them.
We find that the term ""accessories"" is used in the schedule to describe goods which may have been manufactured for use as an aid or addition.
A sense in which the word accessory is used is given in Webster 's Third New International Dictionary as follows: ""all objects or device that is not essential in itself but that adds to the beauty, convenience, or effectiveness of something else"".
Other meanings given there are: ""supplementary or secondary to something of greater or primary importance""; ""additional""; ""any of several mechanical devices that assist in operating or controlling the tone resources of an organ."" ""Accessories"" are not necessarily confined to particular machines for which they; may serve as aids.
The same item may be an accessory of more than one kind of instrument.
It will be noticed that the entry we have to interpret includes parts"" as well as ""accessories"" which are required for use in projectors or other cinematographic equipment.
We think that the Andhra Pradesh High Court correctly held that the main use of the arc carbons under consideration was duly proved to be that of production of powerful light used in projectors in cinemas.
The fact that they can also be used for search lights, signalling, stage lighting, or where powerful lighting for photography or other purposes may be required, could not detract from the classification to which the carbon arcs belong.
That is determined by their ordinary or commonly known purpose or user.
This, as already observed by us, is evident from the fact that they are known as ""cinema arc carbons"" in the market.
This finding was enough, in our opinion, to justify the view taken by the Andhra Pradesh High Court that the goods under consideration are covered by the relevant entry No. 4.
Consequently, we dismiss these appeals with costs.
V.P.S. Appeals dismissed.
","Entry 4 of the I Schedule of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957, reads: Cinematographic equipment including. parts and accessories required for use therewith.
on the question whether Arc Carbons, known as 'Cinama Arc Carbons ' manufactured by the appellant fall under the entry and their sales were, there fore, rightly subjected to sales tax.
^ HELD: The meaning of an entry can only be satisfactorily determined in the light of the language of the entry itself considered in the context in which it occurs.
and cases relating to totally different entries will have only a very remote bearing.
Entry 4 occurs in a Schedule of taxable goods.
When it was intended to confine an entry to particular gadgets and 'parts thereof ' the entry said so.
Entry 4, however, includes 'parts ' as well as 'accessories '.
The term 'accessories ' is used to describe goods which may have been manufactured for use as an aid or addition to particular machines, though, they may serve as aids to other kinds of instruments also.
But, this entry and other entries use the expression 'required for use therewith '.
The description of the goods in these entries indicates that the expression has been employed for equipment or accessories connected with the main purpose.
Therefore, it is its general of predominant use that determines the category in which an article will fall.
[563D F, G; 564B C] In the present case, the main use of Arc Carbons was proved to be that of production of powerful light used in projectors in Cinemas.
The fact that they can also be used for other purposes such as for search lights etc., will not detract from their classification under Entry 4.
The classification is determined by their ordinary or common known purpose or user which is evident from he fact thy are known as 'cinema Arc Carbons ' in the market.

380,"Appeal No. 205 of 1954.
On appeal from the judgment and order dated the 978 13th April 1954 of the Bombay High Court in Appeal No. 49 of 1954 arising out of the order dated the 31st day of March 1954 of the said High Court exercising its Ordinary Original Jurisdiction in Misc.
Petition No. 55 of 1954.
K. T. Desai, P. N. Bhagwati, Rameshwar Nath and Rajinder Narain, for the appellants.
C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General of India, (Porus A. Mehta and B. H. Dhebar, with him), for the respondent.
November 10.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.
This appeal raises a question as to the powers of a Custodian of Evacuee Property to cancel a lease granted by him under section 12 of the (XXXI of 1950), hereinafter referred to as the Act.
Messrs Abdul Karim and Brothers owned, along with certain other properties which are not the subject matter of the present appeal, three mills with bungalows and chawls at Ambernath in Thana District and the Bobbin Factory at Tardeo in Bombay.
They having migrated to Pakistan, these properties were declared by a notification dated 12 9 1951 issued under section 7 of the Act as evacuee property, and under section 8(1) of the Act, they became vested in the respondent as the Custodian for the State.
The appellants are displaced persons, and on 30 8 1952 the respondent entered into an agreement with them, Exhibit A, which is, as aptly characterised by learned counsel for the appellants, of a composite character, consisting of three distinct matters.
There was, firstly, a demise under which the mills and the factory in question were leased to the appellants for a period of five years on the terms and conditions set out therein.
Secondly, there was a sale of the stock of raw materials, unsold finished goods, spare parts, cars, trucks and other movables which were in the mills and the factory, with elaborate provisions for the determination and payment of the price therefor in 979 due course.
And thirdly, there was an agreement to sell the mills and the factory to the appellants in certain events and subject to certain conditions.
There was also a clause for referring the disputes between the parties to arbitration.
In pursuance of this agreement, the appellants were put in possession of the mills and the factory on 31 8 1952.
On 12 2 1954 the respondent issued a notice to the appellants, Exhibit C, wherein be set out that the appellants had systematically committed breaches of the various terms on which the properties bad been leased to them, and called upon them to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled and why they should not be evicted.
The notice then went on to state that the respondent considered it necessary to issue certain directions for the ""preservation of the demised premises and the goods and stock in trade, etc., lying in the demised premises"", and the appellants were accordingly required not to remove the stock or raise any money on the security thereof, and to send daily reports to the Custodian, of the transactions with reference thereto.
Presumably, these directions were given under section 10 of the Act.
On 13 2 1954 the appellants appeared before the respondent, and contended that he had no auth ority to issue the notice in question under section 12, and that it was therefore illegal.
Apprehending that the lease might be cancelled, and that they might be evicted, the appellants filed on 16 2 1954 the application out of which the present appeal arises, for a writ of certiorari for quashing the notice, Exhibit C, and for a writ of prohibition restraining the respondent from taking any further action pursuant thereto.
In support of the petition, the appellants urged that section 12 under which the respondent purported to act authorised the cancellation of only leases granted by the evacuee and not by the Custodian himself, and that no directions could be given under section 10 as it applied only to properties of the evacuee, and that by reason of the sale, the movables in question had become the property of the appel 124 980 lants.
The petition was heard by Tendolkar, J., who stated the points for determination thus: (1) ""Whether the Custodian has power under section 12 of the , to terminate a lease granted by himself, and (2) Whether the directions given by the Custodian are beyond the jurisdiction conferred upon him by section 10 of the said Act?"" On the first question, he held that section 12 applied only to leases granted by the evacuee and not by the Custodian, and that therefore the notice, Exhibit C, was ultra vires the powers of the Custodian under that section.
On the second question, he held that section 10 applied only to properties of the evacuee, and that the movables in respect of which directions were given, ceased to be the property of the evacuee by reason of the sale in favour of the appellants, and that in consequence, the directions with reference to them were unauthorised.
In the result, the application was allowed.
The respondent took the matter in appeal, and that was heard by Chagla, C.J. and Dixit, J.
By their judgment dated 13 4 1954, they held that on the plain language of section 12 it would apply whenever there was a lease, and that lease was in respect of property belonging to the evacuee, that there was no warrant for imposing a further limitation on that section that that lease should also have been granted by the evacuee, and that accordingly the Custodian had power to issue the notice, Exhibit C, for cancelling the lease.
As regards movables, however, they agreed with Tendolkar, J. that for the reasons given by him the Custodian had no authority under section 10 to issue any directions with reference thereto.
The appeal was accordingly allowed in so far as it related to the lease but dismissed as regards movables.
Against this judgment, the appellants have preferred this appeal on a certificate granted by the High Court under article 133(1) (b), and the only point that arises for determination therein is as to whether the Custodian has the power under section 12 to 981 cancel a lease granted by himself and not by the evacuee.
But that question is no longer open to argument, as there has been subsequent to the decision of the court below legislation which concludes the matter.
Section 5 of the Administration of Evacuee Property (Amendment) Act, 1954 (XLII of 1954) enacts the following Explanation to section 12 of Act XXXI of 1950: ""In this sub section 'lease ' includes a lease granted by the Custodian and 'agreement ' includes an agreement entered into by the Custodian"".
And it provides that the Explanation ""shall be inserted and shall be deemed always to have been inserted"" in the section.
Mr. Desai, learned counsel for the appellants, concedes that this amendment which is retrospective in operation would govern the rights of the parties in the present appeal, and that under the section as it now stands, the Custodian has the power and had always the power to cancel leases created not merely by the evacuees but also by himself.
But he con tends that this power could be exercised only so as to override a bar imposed by any law but not the contract under which the lease is held, and this result flows according to him from the language of the non obstante clause, which is limited to anything contained in any other law for the time being in force"", and does not include ""or any contract between the parties"".
This was a contention which was open to the appellants on the terms of the section as it stood even before the amendment, but it was not put forward at any stage prior to the bearing of this appeal and that by itself would be sufficient ground for declining to entertain it which it may be noted is now sought to be raised by a supplemental proceeding under Order 16, rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules.
On the merits also it is without any substance.
The section expressly authorises the custodian to vary the terms of the lease, and that cannot be reconciled with the contention of the appellants that it confers no authority on him to go back upon his own contracts.
The operative portion of the section which confers power on 982 the Custodian to cancel a lease or vary the terms thereof is unqualified and absolute, and that power cannot be abridged by reference to the provision that it could be exercised ""notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force"".
This provision is obviously intended to repel a possible contention that section 12 does not by implication repeal statutes conferring rights on lessees, and cannot prevail as against them and has been inserted ex abundanti cautela.
It cannot be construed as cutting down the plain meaning of the operative portion of the section.
Vide the observations in Aswini Kumar Ghosh vs Arabinda Bose(1) and the Dominion of India vs Shrinbai A. Irani(1) on the scope.
of a non obstante clause.
We must accordingly bold that the respondent was acting within his authority in 'issuing Exhibit C in so far as it concerned the lease granted in favour of the appellants.
It was next contended by Mr. Desai that even if the Custodian had the power under section 12 to cancel the lease in favour of the appellants, be bad no power under that section to cancel the agreement to sell the mills and the factory to them, which was one of the matters contained in Exhibit A, that the notice, Exhibit C, was to that extent without juris,diction, and that the respondent should accordingly be prohibited from cancelling that portion of Exhibit A in pursuance of Exhibit C.
But the notice in terms refers firstly to the lease which it is proposed to cancel, and secondly to the movables in respect of which certain directions were given.
In their petition under article 226, it was the validity of the notice.
, Exhibit C, with reference to these two matters that the appellants challenged.
Tendolkar, J. stated in his judgment and quite correctly that these were the two points that &rose for determination.
The question of the rights of the appellants in so far as they related to the purchase by them of the mills and the factory was not raised in the petition, and no contentions were put forward in support thereof at any stage of the proceedings.
It is for the first time in the argu (1) ; , 21, 24.
(2) ; , 213.
983 ment before us that those rights are sought to be agitated.
Under the circumstances, we must decline to consider them.
It will be sufficient if we observe that the rights of the appellants, if any, other than those arising out of the lease, are left open to the determination of the appropriate authorities, and that nothing in our decision should be taken as a pronouncement on those rights.
In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
","By section
,12, sub section 1, of the (XXXI of 1950) as amended by Act XLII of 1954, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Custodian may cancel any allotment or terminate any lease or amend the terms of any lease or agreement under which any evacuee property is held or occupied by a person, whether such allotment, lease or agreement was granted or entered into before or after the commencement of this Act"".
The respondent who was the Custodian of evacuee property granted a lease to the appellants and subsequently issued a notice to them, among other things, calling upon them to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled for committing breaches of the conditions on which the properties had been leased to them.
The appellants contended that the respondent had no power to cancel the lease on the ground that under section 12(1) of the Act the power of the Custodian to cancel the lease could be exercised only so as to override a bar imposed by any law but not the contract under which the lease was held and relied on the language of the non obstante clause contained in the section.
Held, that the operative portion of the section which confers power on the Custodian to cancel a lease is unqualified and absolute and could not be abridged by reference to the non obstante clause which was only inserted ex abundanti cautela with a view to repel a possible contention that the section does not by implication repeal statutes conferring rights on lessees.

3356,"N: Criminal Appeal No. 425 1974.
Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated the 22nd July 1974 of the Madras High Court at Madras in Criminal Appeal No. 24 of 1974 and Referred Trial No. 3 of 1974.
A. N. Mulla, K. Jayaram and P. Chandrasekhar for the Appellant. , A. V. Rangam and Miss A. Subhasini for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GOSWAMI, J.
This appeal by special leave is directed against the 4 judgment and order of the, High Court of Madras convicting the appellant (hereinafter to be described as the accused) under section 302 IPC and sentencing him to death.
709 The police had submitted charge sheet under section 302/34 IPC against the present accused and accused Jabamani Nadar alias Kanyakumari Comrade alias Ramu and Thamizharasan alias Ramaswami, who was shown as an absconder.
On the prayer of the prosecution the case against the first two accused without the absconding accused, was taken up for trial.
The two accused were charged under section 120B read with sections 302 and 109 IPC as well as under section 302/34 IPC.
The case was referred to the High Court as usual and the accused also preferred appeals against their conviction and sentence.
The High Court acquitted accused Jabamani Nadar alias Kanyakumari Comrade alias Ramu and accepted the reference in respect of the present accused.
His appeal was also dismissed.
Hence this appeal by special leave.
The facts are in a brief compass.
The deceased, Viswanatham Pillai, was the village Munsif (Headman).
On April 26, 1971, at about 10.00 P.M. he was sleeping on a bench outside his cattle shed in the open space, which is shown in the site plan (exhibit P15) at No. 9.
The younger brother of the deceased, Pandurangam (PW 4), who is a leper, was also sleeping on the eastern parapet of the sluice of the north Boothagudi channel, which is shown at No. 5 in the site plan (exhibit P15).
Pandurangam woke up at about 11.15 P.M.
On hearing the shout of his deceased brother crying ""younger brother: Karunakaran is running after stabbing me with knife. 'Catch him ' "".
He got up and saw the accused Karunakaran running on the eastern bank of the channel with a knife 8 inches long.
The electric lights were burning in the vicinity He also saw two persons running ahead of accused Karunakaran.
He further saw his two brothers, Gnanasakaran (PW 1) and Thiru gnanasambandam (PW 3) along with Ramasamy (PW 2) chasing them.
He ran to his elder brother who came from the side of the bench where he was sleeping and who fell down on the southern side of the sluice.
When he went near him he was already dead.
He had bleeding injuries on several parts of his body.
A crowd gathered and Pandurangam was asked to lodge information at the police station which he did.
The doctor (PW 16) who held the postmortem examination found nine injuries two of which he described as incised and four as punctured incised, two more as punctured and the remaining one as a vertical incised wound.
These were on the left upper arm, left fore arm, on the left side of the epigastrium, on the left side of the anterior axillary line, on the left mid axillary line, on the right side of the epigastrium and on the left side of the back.
Injuries are very severe and according to the doctor death was due to shock and hemorrhage on account of the injuries.
It is clear that whosoever had inflicted these injuries definitely had ? the intention to cause the death of the victim.
In the first information report which PW 4 lodged at the Thana, which is very close to the place of occurrence, within about 15 minutes of the occurrence, inter alia, stated thus: 4 L159SCI/76 710 At about 11.15.
P.M. I woke up on hearing a noise to the effect 'younger brother, Karunakaran is running after stabbing me with knife, 'catch him '.
I stood up and saw Karunakaran, son of Orathur Ayyathurai Padayachi running eastwards from the place where I lay and my elder brother chasing him from behind.
I too came running"".
It will be seen that at the time of lodging of the first information report only the present accused was implicated.
Even so, later on four eye witnesses were produced implicating not only the present accused but also two other accused.
The High Court after appreciating the entire evidence rejected the evidence of these eye witnesses, namely, PW 1, 2, 3 and 5 and described them as ""a bunch of liars"", ""unashamed liars and perjurers"".
The High Court, therefore, acquitted the second accused, Jabamani Nadar alias Kanyakumari Comrade alias Ramu and also observed that necessarily no case would lie on this kind of testimony against even the absconding accused.
It was also observed that the High Court ""can place no reliance on the testimony of PW 4 in so far as he implicated the second accused and Tharnizharasan in the case of murder of Viswanatham"".
The High Court further observed: ""Poor PW 4 was compelled to speak to a version which ought to accord and harmonise with the version given out by , PWs 1, 2 and 3"".
Even so the High Court thought that it was justified in convicting the present accused on the sole testimony of PW 4 ""corroborated by the contents of exhibit P1 (FIR)"".
The High Court held that ""PW 4 who was afflicted with the fell disease of leprosy. has absolutely no motive to implicate the first accused"".
The High Court further held that PW 4 gave a ""candid, natural and truthful version. at the earliest opportunity"".
The High Court has taken note of the fact that ""there has been a history of a bitter feud spanning over nearly a decade between the first accused and his father on the one hand and the deceased Viswanatham t on the other"".
This is, therefore, a case where conviction of the accused depends .
on the sole testimony of a single witness.
If the witness is absolutely reliable there can be no infirmity in convicting the accused.
In that ' case even corroboration may not be sought for.
ordinarily in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution we would have hestitated to go into the facts to reappreciate the evidence.
It is, however, not possible to adopt that course in this case where the testimony of the sole witness has been rejected with reference to the 1 second accused who was on the same boat with the appellant.
The very fact that this eye witness could be persuaded to substitute PWs 1, 2 and 3 for his deceased brother as chasing the assailants, degrades him from the status of an absolutely reliable witness.
He is definitely an obliging witness and cannot at all be trustworthy.
This witness may not have a qualm of conscience in implicating the accused for the 711 mere asking by someone, if not by the inimical police officer (PW 23) against whom criminal cases were pending at the instance of the accused 's father.
Apart from that we find that the High Court has not considered the intrinsic quality of the evidence of PW 4.
It failed to notice certain broad facts which should definitely weigh with the court while appreciating ocular testimony.
From the medical evidence it is clear that there were more than one assailant and yet for the FIR it appears that there was only one assailant.
This may not, in a given case, be considered as a very serious infirmity since the witness may not have seen the other.
assailants when he came running to the place of occurrence.
But the fact that the witness has stated in the first information report that the deceased was only mentioning the name of accused Karunakaran as his assailant, this earlier version appears to be contradicted by the medical evidence.
Besides, he has deliberately changed his own stand in court when he deposed that he saw two other persons running ahead of Karunakaran being chased by his two brothers and Ramaswamy.
Another very serious departure from his earlier version is that while PW 4 had stated in the first information report that ""my elder brother"" (meaning the deceased) was ""chasing him from behind"" in court he has completely given a go by to this statement and stated that Karunakaran was being chased by PWs 1, 2, and 3.
He did not at all refer to the deceased chasing him.
If his statement in court that he saw PWs 1, 2 and 3 chasing Karunakaran while running away after the assault is true, it is difficult to appreciate that he would not mention about this fact in the first information report.
He admitted in the course of cross examination that the Sub Inspector asked him whether he had any witnesses and that he ""did not tell about them due to excitement"".
It is difficult to accept this explanation of this witness.
Assuming that his earlier version in the first information report is true that the deceased chased the accused .
as the latter was running away after the assault we would have expected some evidence of a trail of blood stains from the place where he was sleeping to the place where he fell dead.
On the other hand we find that there is a mention about a pool of blood only where the dead body was found at No. 1 in the site plan.
There were also no blood stains on the bench where he was said to be sleeping.
We further find from the evidence of PW 4 in cross examination that when he went near his deceased elder brother about hundred persons were there and ""none of them asked him as to how it had happened"".
We do not find in this case a single witness out of that crowd produced in court for the purpose of corroborating PW 4.
If the statement of PW 4 is to be believed, the crowd had gathered at the place of occurrence already when he arrived.
It is also conceivable that those persons, who arrived at the place of occurrence a little earlier than PW 4, did not see the assailants who might have already escaped.
It also stands to reason that those persons who gathered would not ask PW 4, who arrived at the place a little later, for information with regard to the assailants.
There is considerable doubt as to this testimony with regard to seeing the accused running away from the place of occurrence.
When the accused is 712 going to lose his life in such a serious charge it is only necessary that the court should be circumspect and closely scrutinise the evidence to come to an unhesitating conclusion that he is absolutely reliable.
We are unable to say that the High Court in this case has made a correct approach in assessing the quality of the testimony of this solitary eye witness.
The High Court is not even right that PW 4 stands wholly corroborated by the contents of the FIR.
On the other hand we have .
r shown that his version in the FIR stands contradicted by the testimony in court on a very material point.
For the reasons given above we are unable to place such reliance as is requisite on the testimony of this uncorroborated solitary witness for convicting the accused facing a murder charge.
The conviction and sentence of death are, therefore, set aside.
The appeal is allowed and the accused shall be released from detention forthwith.
S.R. Appeal allowed.
","The appellant along with ""J"" & '.T"" was charged for offences u/s 120B/109/ 302 I.P.C. as well as 302/34 I.P.C. The trial which proceeded in the absence of absconding ""T"", resulted in the conviction and both the accused were sentenced to death sentence.
On a reference and appeals by the accused the High Court acquitted ""J"" rejecting four out of five eye witnesses and disbelieving even the only other eye witness who lodged the First Information Report.
The High Court however maintained the conviction and confirmed the death sentence on the appellant relying on the testimony of the very same single witness.
on appeal by special leave, the Court ^ HELD: (i) Ordinarily in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution the Court would hesitate to go into the facts to reappreciate the evidence.
It is, however.
not possible to adopt that course, where the testimony of the sole witness has been rejected with reference to the second accused was on the same boat with the appellant.
When the accused is going to lose his life in such a serious charge u/s 302 I.P.C. it is only necessary that the Court should be circumspect and closely scrutinise the evidence to come to an unhesitating conclusion that the sole single witness is absolutely reliable.
[710G, H, 711H, 712A] (ii) In the instant case, the High Court was not correct in appreciating the ocular testimony of a sole witness, because (a) the very fact that the eye witness could be persuaded to substitute PWs.
1, 2. and 3 for his deceased brother as chasing the assailants, contrary to the version of the F.I.R. degrades him from the status of an absolutely reliable witness, not having a qualm of conscience, but an obliging and untrustworthy witness.
[710H] (b) 'The version in the F.I.R. stands contradicted by the testimony in court on a very material point and does not corroborate.
[712 B] (c ) Placing such reliance.
therefore.
as is requisite on the testimony of the uncorroborated solitary witness for convicting the accused facing a murder charge is not possible in the case. [712 B]

78,"N: Criminal Appeal No. 8 of 1951.
Appeal from an Order of the High Court of Bombay (Bavdekar and Chainani JJ.) dated 20th February, 1950, in Criminal Appeal No. 106 of 1950 arising out of an order dated 9th January, 1950, of the Presidency Magistrate, 19th Court, Esplanade, Bombay, in Case No. 10879/P of 1949.
The facts are stated in the judgment.
Iswarlal C. Dalai and R.B. Dalai, for the appellant.
C.K. Daphtary, Solicitor General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the Republic of India (respondent No. 1).Jindra Lal for the respondent No. 2. 1952.
February 1.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
The facts out of which this Crimi nal Appeal has arisen are not long.
The appellant, W.H. King, who is carrying on a business in Bombay under the name and style of Associated Commercial Enterprises, was the tenant of a flat on the second floor of a building called ""Ganga Vihar"", Marine Drive, Bombay, which belongs to a lady named Durgeshwari Devi.
The tenancy was a monthly one, the rent being Rs. 215.
It is said that the appellant wanted to go to the United Kingdom for treatment of his failing eye sight and he got into touch with the complainant Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia, who is the second respondent in this appeal, through one Sayed for the purpose of making necessary ar rangements about the flat occupied by him in view of his intended departure.
The prosecution case is that the accused demanded a sum of Rs. 30,000 which was later on reduced to Rs. 29,500 as consideration for putting the complainant in vacant possession of the flat and an additional amount of Rs. 2,000 for the furniture, and that the complainant agreed to pay these sums.
The complainant actually paid the accused two sums of 420 Rs. 500 each on 7th November, 1948, and 17th November, 1948.
He, however, got into touch with the police on 1 12 1948, and in conjunction with the latter, a trap was laid for the appellant.
It was arranged that the complainant should bring with him Rs. 1,000, being the balance due in respect of the furniture and that the police would give him Rs. 29,500 to be paid to the appellant.
The complainant and a Sub Inspec tor, posing as the complainant 's brother, went to the appel lant on 4 12 1948, and paid him the two sums of money; and the keys of the flat and the motor garage were handed over to the complainant.
As the appellant and his wife were leaving the flat, the man, who masqueraded as the complain ant 's brother, threw off his disguise and disclosed his identity.
The police party, who were down below ready for the raid, held up the car of the appellant and recovered the sum of Rs. 30,500 from the rear seat of the car and also some papers, a typed draft of a partnership agreement be tween the complainant and the appellant and an application form for permission to occupy the building as caretaker.
From the complainant were recovered the bunch of keys and the documents that were handed over to him by the appellant, namely, the letter handing vacant possession (Exhibit D).
the receipt for Rs. 2,000 for the articles of furniture (Exhibit E), a letter to the Bombay Gas Company for transfer of the gas connection to the name of the complainant (Exhib it F), and the letter to the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Committee for transfer of the telephone connec tions and the deposit of Rs. 27 (Exhibit G).
The appellant was charged under section 18(1) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVII of 1947, for receiving a pugree of Rs. 29,500 and he was further charged under section 19(2) of the said Act for receiving the said sum as a condition for the relin quishment of his tenancy.
His wife, who was the second accused in the case, was charged with aiding and abetting her husband in the commission of the two offences.
421 The defence of the appellant was that he was in search of a partner to carry on his business during his intended absence, who was also to act as caretaker of his flat anal that it was in this connection and with this object in view that he entered into negotiations with the complain ant.
The sum of Rs. 29 500 was not pugree but represented capital for 0 12 0 share in the business and as the com plainant was also to be a caretaker of the flat, the sum of Rs. 2,000 was paid and received as a guarantee against disposal and damage of the furniture and it was agreed to be paid back on the appellant 's return to India.
The wife of the appellant denied any aiding and abetting.
The Presidency Magistrate, who tried the case, disbe lieved the defence on the facts, holding that what was received by the accused was by way of pugree.
As section 18 (1) of the Act was not applicable he convicted him under section 19(2) of the Act and sentenced him, in view of his old age and blindness, to one day 's simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 30,000.
The wife was acquitted, the evidence being insufficient to prove any abetment.
The appellant preferred an appeal to the High Court of Bombay but it was summarily dismissed on 20 2 1950.
He asked for a certificate under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution but this was rejected on 10 4 1950.
Thereaf ter he applied for special leave to appeal to this Court and it was granted on 3 10 1950.
A short legal argument was advanced on behalf of the appellant based on the language of section 19 (1) of the Act and this is the only point which requires our consideration.
The section which consists of two parts is in these terms:"" ""(1) It shall not be lawful for the tenant or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the tenant to claim or receive any sum or any consideration as a condi tion for the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises; 422 (2) Any tenant or person who in contravention of the provisions of sub section (1) receives any sum or considera tion shall, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months and shall also be pun ished with fine which shall not be less than the sum or the value of the consideration received by him.
"" It was urged that the offence arises only on receipt of any sum or any consideration as a condition of the relin quishment by a tenant of his tenancy and that in the present case there was no such relinquishment.
Exhibit D, which is the most material document, under which the appellant handed over vacant possession of the flat to the complainant, constitutes or evidences an assignment of the tenancy and not a relinquishment.
It says : ""I, W.H. King, hereby hand over vacant possession of my flat No. 3 situated on 2nd floor and garage No. 4 on the ground floor of Ganga Vihar Building on Plot No. 55 situated on Marine Drive Road to Mr. Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia from this day onward and that I have no claim whatsoever over this flat and Mr. Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia will pay the rent directly to the landlord.
"" The argument raised on behalf of the appellant appears to us to be sound and has to be accepted.
The learned Solic itor General urged that 'the word ""relinquishment"" was not a term of art and was used in the section not in any strict technical sense but in its comprehensive meaning as giving up of possession of the premises; and he pointed out that if it was intended by the legislature that ""relinquish ment"" should have the limited meaning sought to be placed upon it on behalf of the appellant, the word ""surrender"" used in the Transfer of Property Act would have been more appropriate.
Sections 15 and 18 of the Act were referred to in this connection but in our opinion they lend no assist ance to the argument of the learned counsel.
Any sublet ting, assignment or transfer in any other manner of his interest by the tenant is made unlawful under 423 section 15.
Section 18 deals with the grant, renewal or continuance of a lease of any premises or the giving of his consent by the landlord to the transfer of a lease by sub lease or otherwise, and it provides that the landlord, who receives any fine, premium, or other like sum or deposit, or any consideration for the grant, renewal or continuance or the accord of consent oh would be guilty of an offence and liable to the punishment therein specified.
It would thus be seen that an assignment of the lease or transfer in any other manner by a tenant is not made an offence; the statute merely says that it is not a lawful transaction.
It is the landlord 's consent to the transfer of a lease by sub lease or otherwise on receipt of consideration that has been made an offence.
Then follows section 19 which speaks of the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises by a tenant.
If, by the expression, an assignment such as we have in the present case was meant, appropriate words could have been used, such as the transfer by a tenant of his interest, which we find in section 108, sub clause (i), of the Trans fer of Property Act.
The distinction between an assignment on the one hand and relinquishment or surrender on the other is too plain to be ignored.
In the case of an assignment, the assignor contin ues to be liable to the landlord for the performance of his obligations under the tenancy and this liability is contrac tual, while the assignee becomes liable by reason of privity of estate.
The consent of the landlord to an assignment is not necessary, in the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary.
But in the case of relinquishment, it cannot be a unilateral transaction; it can only be in favour of the lessor by mutual agreement between them.
The relin quishment of possession must be to the lessor or one who holds his interest.
In fact, a surrender or relinquishment terminates the lessee 's rights and lets in the lessor.
It is no doubt true that the word ""relinquishment"" does not occur in the Transfer of Property Act but it is found in many of the Tenancy Acts in various provinces where there are Sec tions which deal with the 55 424 relinquishment of their holdings by tenants in favour of the landlord by notice given to him in writing.
The section in question, it should be further noted, does not speak of relinquishment or giving up of possession,in general terms.
The words are ""the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises"".
The relinquishment of a tenancy is equivalent to surrender by the lessee or tenant of his rights as such.
Whether abandonment of a tenancy would come within the meaning of relinquishment is a question that does not arise in this appeal, because in the face of Exhibit D, there is no abandonment in the sense that the tenant disappeared from the scene altogether saying nothing and making no arrange ments about his interest and possession under the lease.
As the statute creates an offence and imposes a penalty of fine and imprisonment, the words of the section must be strictly construed in favour of the subject.
We are not concerned so much with what might possibly have been intend ed as with what has been actually said in and by the language employed.
As in our view, there has been no ""relinquishment"" within the meaning of section 19, sub clause (1), the conviction under sub clause (2) cannot be sustained.
It is set aside and the fine of Rs. 30,000 will be refunded if it has al ready been paid.
The other parts of the order of the learned Presidency Magistrate, as regards the disposal of Rs. 1,000 paid by the complainant to the appellant and the sum of Rs. 29,500 brought in by the police, will, however, stand.
Conviction sit aside.
Agent for respondent No. 1: P.A. Mehta.
Agent for respondent No. 2: Ganpat Rai.
","Sub section (1) of sec.
19 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVI I of 1947, provided that ""it shall not be lawful for the tenant or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the tenant to claim or receive any sum or any consideration as a condition for the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises""; and sub sec.
(2) provided that any tenant or person who in contravention of the provisions of sub sec.
(1) receives any sum or consideration shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment and also with fine.
A. who was a tenant of a flat, handed over vacant posses sion the flat to B on receiving ""pugree"", under a document which recited that A shall have no claim whatever over the flat and that B shall pay the rent directly to the landlord.
A was convicted of an offence under sec.
19 (2).
Held, that there was no ""relinquishment"" of his tenancy by A, within the meaning of sec.
19 (1) and the conviction could not be sustained.
There is a clear distinction between an assignment of a tenancy on the one hand and a relinquishment or surrender on the other.
In the case of an assignment, the assignor con tinues to be liable to the landlord for the performance of his obligations under the tenancy and this liability is contractual, while the assignee becomes liable by reason of privity of estate.
The consent of the landlord to an as signment is not necessary, in the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary.
But in the case of relinquish ment it cannot be a unilateral transaction; it can only be in favour of the lessor by mutual agreement between them.
Relinquishment of possession must be to the lessor or one who holds his interest; and surrender or relinquishment terminates the lessee 's rights and lets in the lessor.
As sec.
19 of Bombay Act LVII of 1947 creates an offence and imposes a penalty of fine and imprisonment, the words of the section must be strictly construed in favour of the subject.
The Court is not concerned so much with what might possibly have been intended as with what has been actually said in and by the language employed in the statute.

M. C. Chagla, N. D. Karkhanis, section P. Chowdhury, Bhuvanesh Kumari, for the appellant.
section C. Manchanda, R. N. Sachthey and B. D. Sharma, for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hegde, J.
This is an assessee 's, appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Patna dismissing in limini its writ petition under Arts 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
The assessee is having construction contracts under the Railways as well as the Government.
It is a partnership firm.
For the assessment year 1960 61, relevant to the accounting year 1959 60, after the assessee submitted its income tax return, it was asked by the Income tax Officer during the income tax assessment proceedings to produce before him its books of account and the other relevant papers.
The assessee also produced before him a statement showing various creditors from whom it had borrowed on Hundis during the accounting year in question.
In that statement it gave the lull names and address of the alleged creditors.
After enquiry, the assessee 's total income was assessed at Rs. 69,886/ .
On June 3, 1966, the 1st respondent (Income tax Officer Ward 'A ',, Muzaffarpur) issued to the assessee a notice under section 148 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1961.
The material portion of that notice reads as follows ""Notice under section 148 of the Income tax Act, 1961.
Income Tax Officer, Muzaffarpur Dated, the 3 6 1966.
TO M/s. Chugamal Rajpal, Muzaffarpur.
Whereas (1) have reason to believe that your income chargeable the income of 1960 1961 in respect of which you are assessable to tax for the assessment year 19 19 has escaped assessment within the 444 meaning of section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
I therefore propose to re assess the income for the said assessment year and I hereby require you to deliver to me within 30 days from the date of service of this notice a return in the prescribed form of your income The income assessable relevant to the assessment year 1960 61 of in respect of which you are assessable for the said assessment year.
The notice is being issued after obtaining the necessary satisfaction of the Commissioner of IncomeTax, Bihar and Orissa, Patna.
Sd/ section P. Chaliha Income Tax Officer, Ward A, Muzaffarpur.
"" The assessee challenged the validity of that notice as well as proceedings taken on the strength of that notice on various grounds.
As we are accepting the contention of the assessee that the impugned notice is invalid inasmuch as it did not comply with the requirements of section 151(2) of the Act, we have not thought it necessary to examine the other contentions advanced on behalf of the assessee.
In this case the notice was issued after four years but before eight years of the date of the original assessment.
Section 151 (2) of the Act reads ""No notice shall be issued under Section 148 after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless the Commissioner is satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Income tax Officer that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice."" Section 148 prescribes : ""(1) Before making the assessment, re assessment or re computation under Section 147, the Income tax Officer shall serve on the assesee a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section (2) of Section 139 and 445 the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section.
(2) The Income tax Officer shall, before issuing any notice under this section, record his reasons for doing so.
"" Section 147 deals with income escaping assessment.
At this stage we need not refer to that section : We shall refer to that provision at a later stage.
Section 139(2) says : ""In the case of any person who, in the incometax Officer 's opinion, assessable under this Act, whether on his own total income or, on the total income of any other person during the previous year, the Income tax Officer may, before the end of the relevant assessment year, serve a notice upon him requiring him to furnish, within thirty days from the date of service of the notice, a return of his income or the income of such other person during the previous year, in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed."" (proviso is not necessary for our present purpose) When this appeal came up for hearing on the last occasion, as we found the affidavit filed by the Income tax Officer to 'be vague and indefinite, we directed the learned Counsel for the Department to produce before us the records of the Incometax Officer to show that the, Income tax Officer had complied with the requirements of section 148 and section 151(2) of the Act.
When the appeal was taken up for hearing on the 18th January 1971, only the report submitted by the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner and the order of the Commissioner was produced.
The order sheet recording the reasons of the Income tax Officer as required by section 148(2) was not produced.

Sd/ section P. Chaliha, 30 4 66.
Income tax Officer, A Ward, Muzaffarpur.
"" In his report the Income tax Officer does not set out any reason for coming to the conclusion that this is a fit case to issue notice under section 148.
The material that he had before him for issuing notice under section 148 is not mentioned in the report.
In his report he vaguely refers to certain communications received by him from the C.I.T., Bihar and Orissa.
He does not mention the facts contained in those communications.
All that he says is that from those communications ""it appears that these persons (alleged creditors) are name lenders and the transactions are bogus"".
He has not even come to a prima facie conclusion 447 that the transactions to which he referred are not genuine transactions.
He appears to have had only a vague feeling that they may be bogus transactions.
Such a conclusion 'does not fulfil the requirements of section 151(2).
What that provision requires is that he must give reasons for issuing a notice under section 148.
In other words he must have some prima facie grounds before him for taking action under section 148.
Further his report mentions : ""Hence proper investigation regarding these loans is necessary In other words his conclusion is that there is a case for investigating as to the truth of the alleged transactions.
That is not the same thing as saying that there are reasons to issue, notice under section 148.
Before issuing a notice under section 148, the Income tax Officer must have either reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of these assessee to, make a return under section 139 for any assessment year to the Income tax Officer or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year, income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year or alternatively not withstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned above on the part of the assessee, the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year.
Unless the requirements of clause (a) or (b) of section 147 are satisfied, the Income tax Officer has no jurisdiction to issue a notice under section 148.
From the report submitted by the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner, it is clear that he could not have had reasons to believe that by reason of the assessee 's omission to disclose fully and truly all material ' facts necessary for his assessment for the accounting year in question, income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year; nor could it be said that he as a consequence of information in his possession, had reasons to believe that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year.
We are not satisfied that the Income tax Officer had any material before him which could satisfy the requirements of either cl.
(a) or cl.
(b) of section 147.
Therefore he could not have issued a notice under section 148.
Further the report submitted by him under section 151(2) does not mention any reason for coming to the conclusion that it is a fit case for the issue of a notice under section 148.
We are also of the opinion that the Commissioner has mechanically accorded permission.
He did not himself record that he was satisfied that this was a fit case for the issue of a notice under section 148.
To Question No. 8 in the report which reads ""Whether the, Commissioner is satisfied that it is a case for the I issue of notice under section 148"", he just noted the word ""yes"" and affixed his signatures thereunder.
We are of the opinion .that if only he had read the report carefully, he could never have 448 come to the conclusion on the material before him that this is a fit case to issue notice under section 148.
The important safeguards provided in sections 147 and 151 were lightly treated by the Income tax Officer as well as by the Commissioner.
Both of them, appear to have taken the duty imposed on them under those provisions as of little importance.
They have substituted the form for the substance.
In the result this appeal is allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside and the impugned notice quashed.
The Respondent No. 2 shall pay the costs of the appellant both in this Court and in the High Court.
G.C. Appeal allowed.
","The appellant, a partnership firm, filed its return of income for the assessment year i960 61 and subsequently produced before the Incometax Officer its relevant books of accounts and papers.
It also produced before him the statement showing various creditors from whom it had borrowed on Hundis during the accounting year in question, giving full names and addresses of the alleged creditors.
After enquiry the Incometax Officer made an assessment.
On June 3, 1966 the Income tax Officer issued to the appellant a notice under section 148 of the Income tax Act, 1961.
The notice was issued after four years but before 8 years of the end of the original assessment year.
The appellant challenged the validity of the notice as well as the proceedings taken on the strength of that notice in a writ petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.
The High Court dismissed the petition.
By special leave appeal was filed in this Court.
On direction given by the Court the report submitted by the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner and the Commissioner 's order thereon were produced.
In the report it was said that it appeared that the alleged creditors of the appellant were name lenders and transactions were bogus; hence proper investigation regarding those loans was necessary.
Question No. 8 on the report was whether the Commissioner was satisfied that the case was fit for the issue of notice under section 148.
Against this the commissioner had noted 'yes '.
On these facts this Court, HELD : Under section 148 and section 151(2) the Income tax Officer Must record his reasons for issuing the notice under section 148.
There must be prima facie grounds for taking action under section 148 Further before issuing such a notice the provisions of cis.
(a) and (b) of section 147 must be satisfied.
[447 B, E] In this case the Income tax Officer appears to have had a vague feeling that the transactions were bogus and that the alleged creditors were only name lenders.
According to him proper investigation regarding the loans was necessary.
That is not the same thing as saying that there ,are reasons to issue notice under section 148.
[447 A C] In these circumstances it could not be held that the Income tax Officer had any material before him which could satisfy the requirements of either cl.
(a) or cl.
(b) of section 147.
Therefore he could not have issued a notice under section 148.
Further the report submitted by him under section 151(2) did not mention any reason for coming to the conclusion that it was a fit case for the issue of the notice under section 148.
The Commissioner also mechanically accorded permission.
Thus the important safeguards provided in sections 147 and 151 were lightly treated by the income tax Officer as well as by the Commissioner.
[447 F 448 B] The appeal must accordingly be allowed.

From the Judgment and Order dated 26.7.1988 of the Allahabad High Court in Review Application No. 27(W) of 1988.
Anil Dev Singh and Mrs. section Dikshit for the Appellants.
Yogeshwar Prasad, Vijay Hansaria, Sunil K. Jain, S.K. Jain for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, CJ.
The Respondent, Arun Govil had been granted a permanent commission in the Indian Air Force and was working as a Pilot Officer.
In the year 1972 he was declared unfit by a Medical Board and was, therefore, inval idated from I.A.F. The Government of India issued a scheme for the benefit of ex military officials.
The State of Uttar Pradesh also adopted the same scheme.
Under that scheme the ex military officials were appointed on Contract basis for a fixed term which could be extended from time to time subject to the suitability of the official concerned but not beyond 58 years of age.
Pursuant to the said scheme the State of Uttar Pradesh appointed the respondent as the Secretary, Zila Sainik Board, Unnao on 20th of August, 1979.
Paragraph 2 of the said order of appointment issued on 20th August, 1979 reads thus: ""The appointment shah be on contract for a period of one 241 year w.e.f.
the date of assumption if it is not terminated earlier by giving a one month 's notice by the Hon 'ble Gover nor or on paying one month 's salary in lieu thereof or by giving one month 's notice, by the Officer.
"" The respondent was required to furnish his acceptance of the terms and conditions contained in the said order includ ing the above term relating to the period of appointment and on his accepting the terms and conditions he was appointed as the Secretary in the District Soldiers Board in the district of Unnao in the State of Uttar Pradesh '.
The said term was extended retrospectively, first upto 20th August, 1982 by an order passed in September, 1981 and it 'was again extended upto 31st March, 1983 by an order made in February, 1983.
Again the term was extended upto 30th of August, 1985 by an order dated 1st June, 1983.
All these orders of exten sion were couched almost in the same language.
The relevant part of the last of such orders, namely, the order dated 1st June, 1983 reads as follows: ""Sir, With reference to your letter No. 1020/Sa.
A.D.M./141, Dated 31.3.1982 on the above subject I am directed to say that the terms of the officers mentioned under para 2 who were appointed w.e.f.
the date mentioned in para 4 (has expired).
The Governor is therefore pleased to accord his sanction to extend the period of the contract upto the period mentioned under para 5 subject to the condi tion that their service tenure shall expire on completion of 58 years of age in case the same is completing earlier during the extended period.

During the extended period of the contract conditions of service of officers shall remain same as are mentioned under their Appointment Order.
Letters of accept ance of relevant conditions of service to be obtained from these officers must be submitted to the Government at an early date.
"" It is thus seen that the appointment of the respondent was indisputably in the nature of contract and under the last order of appointment refened to above he was entitled to continue in office in the post in question till 30th of August, 1985 and not beyond that date unless there was a further extension.
But on 29.3.1985 the service of the 1st Respondent was terminated by the issue of a notice and payment of one month 's salary.
The order was to be effective from the date of receipt of termination order and no charges were men tioned therein against the 1st respondent.
The respondent aggrieved by the said order of termina tion filed a Writ Petition on the file of the High Court of Allahabad in Writ Petition No. 3 164 of 1985.
A Division Bench of the High Court found that the order of termination that had been served on the respondent was an invalid one since it had been issued on the basis of Vigilance Report and no opportunity had been given to the respondent to show cause why such action should not be taken against him.
It is not necessary to set out all the reasons given by the High Court for setting aside the order of termination.
The High Court, however, held that the termination order could not be sustained and the Writ Petition was liable to be allowed.
The High Court further issued a direction to the effect that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service.
In the instant case the respondent was entitled to be in service till 30th of Au guSt, 1985 unless there was a further extention.
In the Penultimate paragraph of the judgment the High Court further stated: ""It is open for the opposite parties to con sider the claim of the petitioner for continu ation in service or of fresh appointment and no observations in this regard are being made by this Court.
"" The judgment was delivered on 24.3.1988.
243 The respondent who was not satisfied by the order allow ing the Writ Petition as stated above preferred a Review Petition before the High Court contending that he was enti tled to be reinstated in service on the pronouncement of the Judgment on 24.3.
1988 notwithstanding the fact that his term of office had come to an end on 30th of August, 1985 as stated above and no further order of extention had been passed by the Governor.
In support of the Review Petition the respondent relied on an interim order which had been passed by the High Court during the pendency of the Writ Petition on 10th of July, 1986 which reads thus: ""The post will be kept vacant and in case the petitioner succeeds in his Petition it would be made available forthwith to the petitioner by way of an appointment.
"" The contention of the respondent was that the said interim order entitled him to be reinstated in service irrespective of the fact whether the Governor had extended the period of his appointment beyond 30th of August, 1985.
The High Court allowed the Review PetitiOn on 26.7.1988 and made an order reinstating the Respondent in service which reads as follows: ""This is an application for review of our Judgment dated 24.3.1988 by which we allowed the Writ Petition filed by the Petitioner with certain directions.
It seems that when the writ petition was decided, our attention was not drawn towards the interim order dated 10.7.1986 passed by learned single Judge in which it was provided that one post will be kept vacant and in case the petitioner suc ceeds in his petition it would be made avail able forthwith to the petitioner by way of his appointment.
The petitioner has pointed out inaccuracy in the second paragraph of the operative part of the judgment which says that: ""It is open for the opposite parties to consider the claim of the petitioner for continuation in service or of fresh appoint ment and no observations in this regard are being made by this Court."""" Aggrieved by the above order made on review which di rected the State of Uttar Pradesh, the appellant herein, to reinstate the respondent in service, the State Government has filed this apeal by special leave.
It is not disputed that the scheme under which the respond ent 244 had been appointed provided for an appointment by contract for a specified term which could be extended from time to time and that the term of the respondent had been extended on different occasions after his first appointment and he was not entitled to continue in service beyond 30th August, 1985 unless there was a further extension.
Clauses 6 & 7 of the first order of appointment stated that the respondent was entitled to the leave admissible for temporary employees and for other matters he was to be treated as a temporary Government employee during the tenure of his office.
The appellant government never accepted the position that the respondent was entitled to be treated as a regular employee who had a vested right to continue to hold the post till he attained 58 years of age.
The true position that emerges from the material on record is that the respondent was employed only under a contract which specified the term of his appointment which extended only Upto 30th of August, 1985.
Since it is admitted that no order of 'extension had been sanctioned by the Governor beyond 30th August, 1985, the respondent was entitled to the salary and allowances due to him till 30th of August, 1985 if the order of termination of service served on him on 29.3.
1985 was found to be an invalid one.
It is on this basis that the High court had while setting aside the order of termination by its order dated 24.3.1988 directed that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service and further observed that it was open for the opposite parties to consider the claim of the respondent for continu ation in service or of fresh appointment and no observations in this regard were made by the Court.
A reading of the Judgment of the High Court dated 24.3.1988 shows that the respondent had not urged before the High Court that the order of appointment issued in his case was not in the nature of a contract and the subsequent orders extending his period of appointment till 30th of August, 1985 were liable to be ignored and that he should be treated as a person regularly appointed in Government service entitled to con tinue till he completed the age of 58 years.
Even the order passed on Review on 26.7.1988 does not make out that the respondent had put forward at that stage such a case.
His only case was that the interim order that had been passed on 10.7.86 entitled him to be reinstated in service even though there was no order of extension of service.
If the respond ent was really aggrieved by the Judgment dated 24.3.1988 he should have preferred an appeal before this Court and that he did not do but on the other hand he proceeded to file a Review Petition claiming to be reinstated in service on the slender ground that the interim order conferred on him a right to continue in service beyond 30th of August, 1985 even though his service had not been extended by the Gover nor of Uttar Pradesh.
245 In the circumstances, we feel that while the High Court was right in disposing of the Writ Petition on 24.3.
1988 declaring that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service, i.e., 30th August, 1985 it was not right in making an order on Review on 26.7.1988 relying upon the interim order dated 10.7.1986 which in the circumstances could not have the effect of controlling the jurisdiction of the High Court to dispose of the Writ Petition on merits as it did on 24.3.1988.
We, therefore, set aside the order dated 26.7.1988 passed by the High Court on review and restore the Judgment dated 24.3.1988 passed in the Writ Petition.
The interim order did not and could not amount to a direction that the respondent was entitled to be reinstated in service irrespective of the merits of the case and the extent of his right.
The order passed on review is wholly unsustainable.
We, however, make it clear that what we have stated above does not affect in any way what the High Court has stated in the penultimate paragraph of the Judgment dated 24.3.1988 which reads thus: ""It is open for the opposite parties to con sider the claim of the petitioner for continu ation in service or the fresh appointment and no observations in this regard are being made by this Court.
"" The appeal is accordingly allowed.
No costs.
T.N.A. Appeal allowed.
","Pursuant to a scheme enacted for the benefit of ex military officials the appellant State appointed the re spondent on 20.8.1979 as Secretary Zila Sainik Board on contract basis for a specified period which was further extended upto 30.8.1985.
On 29.3.1985 the services of the respondent were terminated.
The respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the termination order.
By an order dated 24.3.1988 the High Court set aside the termination order holding that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service i.e. upto 30.8.1985.
The respondent preferred a Review Petition before the High Court contending that pursuant to the interim order dated 10.7.1986 passed by the High Court he was entitled to be reinstated in service even though there was no order of extension of service.
By an order dated 26.7.1988, the High Court allowed the Review Petition directing the appellant State to reinstate the respondent in service.
Hence this appeal by the State.
Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order passed on Review, this Court, HELD: 1.
In the instant case, the appointment of the respondent was indisputably in the nature of contract and under tile order of appointment he was entitled to continue in office in the post in question till 30th of August, 1985 and not beyond that date unless there was a further exten sion.
Since no order of extension had been sanctioned by 240 the Governor beyond 30th August, 1985 the respondent was entitled to the salary and allowances due to him till 30th of August, 1985 if tile order of termination of service was found to be an invalid one.
[242B; 244C] 1.1 The High Court was right in disposing of the Writ Petition on 24.3.1988 declaring that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service, i.e. 30th August, 1985.
But it was not right in making an order on Review on 26.7.1988 relying upon the interim order dated 10.7.1986 which ' in the circumstances could not have the effect of controlling the jurisdiction of the High Court to dispose of the Writ Petition on merits as it did on 24.3.1988.
[245A B] 2.
The interim order passed by the High Court did not and could not amount to a direction that the respondent was entitled to be reinstated in service irrespective of the merits of the case and the extent of his right.

3602,"Civil Appeal No. 1744 of 1968.
(Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated 14 6 1967 of the Mysore High Court in Writ Petition No. 440/65).
Mrs. Shyamala Pappu and Girish Chandra, for the Appellant.
Narayana Nettar, for Respondents 4 and 5. 3 1338SCI/76 828 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BEG, J.
The judgment under appeal after certificate of fitness of the case under Article 133(1)(c) of the Constitu tion of India, is very short as it purports to follow the ratio decidendi of Union of India vs
G.M. Shankariah & Ors.
,(1) where this Court had held upon a concession by the Attorney General, that a list prepared under Section 115 of the , (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act '), was provisional.
Therefore, it was held that the writ petition was premature as the final list of officers on an integrated seniority list was still to be prepared after hearing objections.
The High Court of Mysore seems to have been under the misapprehension that the case now before us is also governed by what was held by this Court in Shankariah 's case (supra) with reference to an entirely different and provisional list of Forest Officers.
The case now before us pertains to Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services of the Mysore State in which the petitioner, was given, in the final integration list, a position to which he objected.
Apparently, the petitioner, whose date of birth is given as 28th June, 1915, has retired.
He is a respondent who has not appeared before us, and, therefore, could not be heard by us.
We have, however, gone through his petition and the affidavit filed in its support where, in paragraph 16, he states as fol lows: ""The Mysore State Civil Service Integra tion Rules 1960 provide for filing objections only against the preliminary provisional Inter State Seniority List and do not provide any provision for filing objections or appeal ing against the final Inter State Seniority List as per Annexure 'B '.
Thus we have no other legal remedies open to us for the re dressal of our grievances and the abridgement of our fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India, and, therefore, we are forced to approach this Honble Court to invoke the writ jurisdiction for the redressal.
"" It is apparent that the petitioner re spondent was claiming relief against the final Inter State seniority list although he was given due opportunity to object to the provi sional list.
Mrs. Shyamala Pappu, who has looked up the departmental records, informs us that the petitioner was given ample opportu nity to file his objections to the preliminary list.
Now, Shankariah 's case (supra) was con fined to an admission on behalf of the Central Government that the list before the Court was provisional so that the petitioners before the Court on that occasion were to get opportuni ties of puting forward their objections before the final list is prepared.
In the case before us, the petitioner admits that the Mysore State Civil Services Integration Rules provided for filing of objections against the preliminary provisional Inter State Seniori ty list.
Presumably, he had that opportunity.
Otherwise, he would, no doubt have objected that the rules had not been complied (1) S.L.R. 1969 p.1 (C. As.
1439 & 1446 of 1967 decided on 16 10 1968).
829 with, which he did not do.
His grievance seemed to be that he was not heard after the final list was prepared.
We are unable to appreciate.
this line of attack upon the final list.
We think that the concession in Shankari ah 's case (supra) was confined to the facts of that particular ease.
There the list was provisional.
The most that could be urged, in the light of decisions of this Court, is that a person whose seniority is to be determined under Section 115 of the Act must be given.
an opportunity to object to the proposed assign ment of a place to him in the seniority list.
As already observed above, the petitioner had ample opportunity to do that.
Hence, the principle recognised in Shankariah 's case (supra) was not applicable to such a case.
The judgment of the Mysore High Court was, in our opinion, based on an apparent misun derstanding of Shankariah 's case (supra) and on a failure to appreciate the facts of the case of the petitioner respondent which is now before us.
There was not reference whatsoever to any facts of the case in the order of a few lines by which the petitioner 's petition was disposed of by the High Court on the errone ous assumption that it was governed by Shan kariah 's case (supra).
As the petitioner in the High Court, who is the, respondent before us, was unrepresented, Mrs. Shymala Pappu, appearing on behalf of Union of India, very Conscientiously, took us through Union of India & Anr.
P.K. Roy & Ors.
( '1) from which, learned Counsel thought, the following observations could perhaps be cited on behalf of the petitioner respondent (at p. 202): ""it was argued by Mr. Ashoke Sen that in regard to both these matters the respond ents have a right of representation and the final gradation list should have been pub lished after giving them further oppor tunity to make a representation.
Normally speaking, we should have thought that one opportunity for making a representation against the preliminary list published would have been sufficient to satisfy the require ments of law.
But the extent and applicationof the doctrine of natural justice cannot be imprisoned within the straight jacket of a rigid formula.
The application of the doctrine depends upon the nature of the jurisdiction conferred on the administrative authority, upon the character of the rights of the per sons affected, the scheme and policy of the statute and other relevant circumstances disclosed in the particular case (See the decision of this Court in Shri Bhagwan and Anr.
vs Ram Chand & Ant. ; , 222.
In view of the special circumstances of the present Case we think that the respondents were entitled to an opportunity to make a representation with regard to the two points urged by Mr. Ashoke Sen before the final gradation list was published.
As no such opportunity was furnished to the respondents with regard to these two matters (1) 202.
830 we hold that the combined final gradation list dated April 6, 1962, so far as category 6 is concerned, is ultra vires and illegal and that part of the notification alone must be quashed by grant of a writ in the nature of certiorari"".
We think that any claim to have a say against the final fist prepared, on an analogy with the second opportunity which is afforded to a person to be punished after arriving at a decision on the facts of a departmental trial and proposal to inflict a particular punishment upon him, is quite inap propriate.
No element of punishment at all is involved in preparing either a provisional or a final seniority list.
All that is done is that certain principles are applied in the preparation of the list.
These principles are generally found in the rules or executive directions which are known to or are capable of being found out by the persons affect ed.
When a provisional seniority fist is prepared, there is a possibility of some mistakes occurring about the facts of a case or in the application of those rules.
It would, therefore, be quite fair to give a person affected an 'oppo rtunity to be heard against the proposed fist before it is finalised so that any possible mistakes, either on facts relating to his particular case or of law in applying the rules governing seniority to those facts, may be rectified.
But, once he has had that opportunity, it cannot possibly be said that he should have a further opportunity against even a final seniority list.
If he was to have that opportunity the list would not really be final but only provisional or preliminary.
It will be obviously contradictory to hold it to be a final list and yet declare it Subject to modifica tions on further objections.
We are unable to find any rule of natural justice having such a paralysing scope.
In P.K. Roy 's case (supra), the opportunity afforded was to be given before the publication of the final list.
It was an opportunity to be given before the final list was to be declared and published as a final list.
A right to representation was recognised as existing at time when the list was still to be considered as not finalised presumably because some mistakes had crept in due to want of heating on two points.
Evidently what was meant was that the publication gave the list finality.
In that particular case, the fist had been prepared without due regard to the particular important points which had to be considered before finalisation.
What we have observed does not mean that, if a final list is prepared contrary to the rules applicable or is vitiated on some ground showing that a condition precedent to the finalisation of the list is absent, it would still be inviolable ,Dr sacrosanct.
Even a list purporting to be final can be vitiated by non observance of conditions prece dent.
In order to establish the invalidity of the final list on some such grounds of invalidity, those grounds have to be shown to exist.
We find no such grounds in the ease before us.
Learned Counsel for the Central Government had cited before us Union of India vs
G.R. Prabhavalkar & Ors.
(1) where it was held by this Court (at p. 2106): (1) A.I.R. 1973 'S.c. 2102 at 2106.
831 ""In our opinion the contentions of the learned Additional Solicitor General are well founded.
The Central Government, under Sec. 115 of the Act, has to determine the princi ples governing equation of posts and prepare a common gradation list by integration of services.
To assist it in the task of inte gration of services and for a proper consid eration of representations, the Central Gov ernment is empowered to establish Advisory Committees.
The Central Government is bound to ensure a fair and equitable treatment to officers in the matter of integration of services and preparation of gradation lists.
It has also to give a full and fair opportuni ty to the parties affected to make their representations; and the Central Government has also to ,give a proper consideration to those representations.
So long as the Central Government has acted properly according to the provisions of the Act, we are of the view that a Court cannot go into the merits or otherwise of equation of posts which is a matter within the province of the Central Government"".
It was also held there (at p. 2106): ""It is no doubt true that the Central Government must have due regard to the princi ples enunciated by it in consultation with the States for the purpose of equation Of posts.
It must not only give an opportunity to the concerned officers to make representations, but it must also give those representations a proper consideration.
It is not within the province of the Courts to lay down what are in the principles to be adopted for purposes of equation.
That falls within the purview of the statute concerned and the authorities charged with such duty.
The power of the Courts is only to see that an authority has acted properly in accordance with the statute.
If that is established, the decision of the authorities concerned will have to stand.
If a particular decision is mala fide or arrived at on totally irrelevant and extraneous consider ations, such a decision can be interfered with by Courts.
In this case, no mala fides are alleged.
"" We find that, as was the case of the petitioner in Prabhavalkar 's case (supra), the petitioner respondent Dr. R.D. Nanjiah, and others similarly placed respondents before us have been unable to make out, in their petitions, any grounds for interference with the final list.
We, therefore, allow this appeal, and set aside the judgment and order of the Mysore High Court.
The parties will bear their own costs.
V.P.S. Appeal allowed.
","(1 ) When a provisional inter State seniority list is prepared for integrating services after States re organisa tion, there is a possibility of some mistakes occurring about the facts of a case or in the .application of the relevant statute or rules or executive directions governing seniority.
It would, therefore, be quite fair to give the person affected an opportunity to be heard against the proposed list before it is made final under 8. 115.
State Reorganisation Act, 1956, so that.
any possible mistakes, either in the facts relating to his case or in the law or rule applied with regard to the proposed assignment of a place to him in the seniority list may be rectified.
But, once he had that opportunity.
it cannot be said that he should have a further opportunity against even a final seniority list, for then such a list would not really be final but will only he provisional or preliminary.
[830 C D] (2) But, even a final list, if it is prepared contrary to the rules applicable or is vitiated on some ground show ing that a condition precedent to the finalisation of the list is absent, or a particular decision is malafide or arrived at on totally irrelevant or extraneous considera tions.
such a final list could be declared invalid by the Court.
G] In the present case.
the officer was not satisfied with the position given to him the final seniority list.
But, since he had an opportunity Under the integration rules of the State for filing objections against the preliminary provisional list, he cannot urge that he should he heard again alter the final list was prepared.[829 A] He cannot claim to have a say against the final list on the analogy of a second opportunity to show cause against a proposed punishment in a departmental enquiry, because.
no element of punishment is involved in preparing either a provisional or a final seniority list.

7109,"Appeal No. 1367 of 1980.
From the Judgment and Order dated 19.7.1979 of the Rajasthan High Court in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 769 of 1979.
Subhash Mallick and S.K. Jain for the Appellant.
B.D. Sharma for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by YOGESHWAR DAYAL,J.
This is an appeal against the judgment of the Rajasthan High Court dated 19th July, 1979 passed in D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 681 of 1978 (Raghubir Singh vs The Board of Revenue for Rajasthan and others) and D.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 769 of 1979 (Surendrapal Singh vs The Board of Revenue for Rajasthan and others).
These writ petitions were decided by the aforesaid common judgment.
The first writ petition was filed by the father Raghubir Singh whereas the second writ petition was filed by his minor son Surendrapal Singh through his next friend Shri Jagjit Singh, maternal grand father of the minor.
The relief claimed in both the petitions before the High Court was the same, namely for setting aside of the order dated 6th August, 1977 passed by the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan, Ajmer.
The facts of the case briefly are that proceedings under Chapter III B of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act (Act No. 3 of 1955) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1955) were commenced for determining the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh.
The Sub Divisional Officer, Hanumangarh, by his order dated 10th August, 1972, determined the ceiling area, but an appeal by Raghubir Singh, the Revenue Appellate Authority, set aside the order of the sub Divisional Officer on March 6, 1973 and remanded the case.
The matter was taken to the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan by a revision application and the Board by its order dated 14th April, 1975 directed that the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh may be determined according to the old law i.e. Act of 1955 and not according to the new law i.e. Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holding Act, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1973).
In pursuance of the direction of the Board, the Sub Divisional Officer, Hanumangarh, by his order dated 5th May, 1976 held that Surendrapal Singh, (appellant herein) aged 12 years, was a minor son of Raghubir Singh and used to 725 study in Punjab and further held that the land in possession of Raghubir Singh was ancestral.
The Sub Divisional Officer, then came to the conclusion that the father and the son constitute two separate units and each one of them was entitled to get 62 Bighas and 8 Biswas.
It was thus held that Raghubir Singh and his son Surendrapal Singh are entitled to retain 124 Bighas and 16 Biswas only and the surplus land measuring, 4 Bighas and 6 Biswas may be resumed.
Aggrieved by the order of the Sub Divisional Officer, Raghubir Singh filed appeal before the Revenue Appellate Authority, Bikaner, who by his order dated 6th September, 1976 dismissed the same and upheld the order of the Sub Divisional Officer.
Dissatisfied with the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority, Raghubir Singh filed a revision application under Section 230 of the Act of 1955 before the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan.
On behalf of raghubir Singh it was urged before the Board that the petitioner was in possession of 112 Bighas only and not 129 Bighas and 3 Biswas as held by the lower courts.
He sought permission to adduce additional evidence in support of his contention.
The application for adducing additional evidence was disallowed.
However, the member of the Board came to the conclusion that Surendrapal Singh (appellant here in) was born to Raghubir Singh on 14th March, 1963 and was only 13 years of age when the ceiling proceedings were finalized by the Sub Divisional Officer on 5th May, 1976.
He further held that the provisions of the old ceiling law applied to the case but the Sub Divisional Officer had committed an error of law in determining the ceiling area under the new law i.e. the Act of 1973.
The Board went on to hold that there is no provision for separate units in Chapter III B of the Act of 1955.
In the ultimate analysis the Member of the Board found that there was a gross and patent illegality in the order of the Sub Divisional Officer and, consequently, set aside the order of the Sub Divisional Officer dated 5th May, 1976 as well as the order of the Appellate Authority dated 6th September, 1976 and remanded the case to the Sub Divisional Officer, Hanumangarh, for fresh determination of the calling area for Raghubir Singh.
Before the Division Bench of the High Court in the writ petitions it was urged on behalf of Raghubir Singh that no appeal having been filed by the State from the order the Sub Divisional Officer dated 5th May, 1976, the said order became final and the Board of Revenue had no jurisdiction to set aside that part of the Sub Divisional Officer 's order which had gone against the State and in his favour.
It was submitted that the power of general superintendence and control over all revenue courts vested in the Board could not be exercised to the detriment of the 726 writ petitioners much less by way of suo motu exercise of powers.
The High Court by the impugned judgment dated 19th July, 1979 upheld the order of the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan and dismissed the writ petitions.
Surendrapal Singh, the erstwhile minor son of Raghubir Singh has come up to this Court by way of special leave which was granted and hence the present appeal.
Mr. Subhagh Mal Jain learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the State having not filed an appeal under section 225 of the Act of 1955 and or revision under Section 230 of the Act of 1955, the Board of the Revenue could not, while hearing the revision petition filed by Raghubir Singh, set aside the orders of Sub Divisional Officer and the revenue appellate authority under Section 221 of the Act of 1955.
Section 221 of the Act of 1955 provides as under: ""221.Subordination of revenue courts.
The general superintendence and control over all revenue courts shall be vested in, an all such Courts shall be subordinate to the Board; and subject to such superintendence, control and subordination (a) x x x (omitted) (b) all Additional Collectors, Sub.
Divisional Officer, Assistant Collectors and Tehsildars in a district shall be subordinate to the Collector thereof, (c)all Assistant Collectors, Tehsildars and Naib Tehsildars in a sub division shall be subordinate to the Sub Divisional Officer thereof, and (d) All Additional Tehsildars and Naib Tehsildars in a tehsil shall be subordinate to the Tehsildar thereof.
"" The contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that the section confers executive powers of superintendence and control on the Board and it does not vest any power of superintendence on the Board on judicial side.
For this purpose he relied or the decision of the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court reported as Karan Singh vs Board of Revenue, Rajasthan.
The Division 727 Bench in that case was concerned with the interpretation of Section 9 of the Land Revenue Act.
Section 9 whereof provides as under: ""9 Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the general superintendence and control over all revenue courts and over all revenue officers shall be vested in, and all such Courts and Officers shall be subordinate to, the Board.
"" In that case also the High Court took the view that it is not correct to say that Section 9 is limited to the executive control and superintendence of the Board over subordinate revenue courts and it does not apply to judicial proceedings.
The contention on behalf of the appellant to that effect was negatived but on merits the High Court held that it was not appropriate for the Board to exercise the powers conferred by Section 9 of the land Revenue Act in view of the fact that the Board had appellate jurisdiction and it could not, therefore, make use of its powers of superintendence and control and the order of the Board could not be held proper with reference to Section 9 of the Land Revenue Act.
This case has no application for interpretation of the present Section 221 of the Act of 1955.
Section 221 of the Act of 1955 is not subject to the other provisions of the Act.
It is clear from the language of Section 221 of the Act of 1955 that the Board of Revenue has general powers of superintendence and control over all revenue courts.
It is both administrative as well as judicial powers.
It is open to the Board to exercise its powers of superintendence on all its subordinate courts in order to regulate the functioning of ' the subordinate courts so as to keep them within their respective spheres of jurisdiction.
If the subordinate court disregards any specific provision of law and does something illegal it is open to the Board of Revenue to interfere and set the matter right.
A similar question arose before the Rajasthan High Court in Kana and others vs
Board of Revenue.
Rajasthan: ILR where the High Court had to construe the power of the Board of Revenue, Rajasthan, conferred on it by the Rajasthan Board of Revenue Ordinance (NO.XXII of 1949).
There also there was similar provision like Section 9 of the Land Revenue Act and it was held that Section 12 of the said Ordinance must be held to give powers to the Board to revise judicial orders also passed by courts in appropriate cases.
It was observed at page 63 of the report ""of course, such powers would generally not be exercised where a party had remedy by way of appeal and revision, and did not avail of it.
At the same time, the power is there, and it may be exercised sparingly in extraordinary case,, where interest of justice requires that the Board should exercise the power"".
Under Section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1955 there was provision of superintendence by High Court in these terms : 728 Each of the High Courts has superintendence over all the courts for the time being subject to its appellate jurisdiction.
"" These words have been consistently interpreted to mean that the High Court had power in appropriate cases to interfere with the judicial orders of the courts.
Reference may in this connection be made to Parmessar Singh vs Kailaspati AIR 1916 Pat. 292 (F.B.).
In the Government of India Act of 1935, there was provision under Section 224 for superintendence by the High Courts ', but subsection(2) made it clear that this superintendence would not be construed as giving to the High Court any jurisdiction to question any judgment of any inferior court which was not otherwise subject to appeal or revision.
Section 221 of the Act of 1955 is similar to Section 107 of the Government of India Act, 1915 and there is no section like sub section (2) of Section 224 of the Government of India Act of 1935 in the Act of 1955.
Thus there is no restriction on the powers of the Board to set aside the order of the Sub Divisional Officer provided it comes to the conclusion that interest of justice requires exercise of such powers.
The Board noticed that there was no provision for separate unit in Chapter III B of tile Act of 1955 and the applicant Raghubir Singh and his son Surendrapal Singh constituted one unit and not two units and the case was remanded to Sub Divisional Officer, Hanumangarh, for de novo determination of the ceiling area for the appellant in law.
The High Court also did not go into the merits of the controversy nor we have thought it advisable to into it and it would be for the Sub Divisional Officer, Hanumangarh to decide it in the light of the observations of the Board.
It is clear from the judgment under appeal that the Board had by its order dated 14th April, 1975 directed that the ceiling, area may be determined according to old law i.e. Act of 1955 and it spite of it the Sub Divisional Officer committed the grave illegality on not merely ignoring the law but also ignoring the directions of the Board of Revenue itself.
The appeal consequently fails and is dismissed with costs.
U. R. Appeal dismissed.
","Proceedings were commenced under Chapter III B of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act 1955 for determining the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh, the father of the appellant.
In a revision application in the first round of litigation.
The Board of Revenue directed that the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh may be determined according to the old law, i.e. Act of 1955, and not according to the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973.
Thereafter, by his order dt.
5.5.76, the SDO held, inter alia, that tile father and the son, appellant, constituted two separate units and each of them was entitled to get 62 bighas and 8 biswas.
Aggrieved by the SDO 's order, Raghubir Singh filed an appeal before Revenue Appellate Authority, which was dismissed.
He then filed a revision application under S.230 of the Act of 1955 before the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan.
He urged that he was in possession of 112 bighas only and sought permission to adduce additional evidence, which was disallowed.
However, the Member of the Board held inter alia that the provisions of the old law applied to the case, but the SDO had committed an error of law in determining the ceiling area under the new Act of 1973.
The Board further held that there is no provision for separate units in Chapter III B of the Act of 1955, and remanded the case to the SDO, Hanumangarh, for fresh determination of the Ceiling area for Raghubir Singh.
Before the High Court, it was urged that the State having not appealed against the order of the SDO dated 5.5.76, it became final, and the Board of 723 Revenue had no jurisdiction to set aside that part of the SDO 's order which had gone against the State and in his favour.
It was submitted that the power of general superintendence and control over all revenue courts which vested in the Board could not be exercised to the detriment of the writ petitioners much less by way of suo motu exercise of powers.
The High Court dismissed the petitions.
Before this court it was submitted that the State not having filed an appeal, or a revision, the Board of Revenue could not, while hearing the revision petition of Raghubir Singh, set aside the orders of the SDO and Revenue Appellate Authority under S.221 of the Act of 1955.
Dismissing the appeal, this court, HELD:. .(1) S.221 is not subject to the other provisions of the Act.
It is clear from the language of Section 221 of the Act 1955 that the Board of Revenue has general powers of superintendence and control over all revenue courts.
It is both administrative as well as judicial powers.
It is open to the Board to exercise its powers of superintendence on all its subordinate courts in order to regulate the functioning of the subordinate courts so as to keep them within their respective spheres of jurisdiction.

1789,"Appeal No. 513 of 1963.
Appeal by special leave from the Award dated December 1961 of the Maharashtra Industrial Tribunal in Reference (I.T.) No. 48 of 1961.
section V. Gupte, Additional Solicitor General, C. L. Dudhia, K. T. Sule, Atiqur Rahman and K. L. Hathi, for the appel lants.
425 M. C. Setalvad, N. V. Phadke, J. B. Dadachanji, O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the respondent No. 1.
March 24, 1964.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J.
This appeal arises out of an industrial dispute as regards the age of retirement.
The first respondent, Shaw Wallace & Co., was incorporated in January, 1946 as a Private Limited Company to take over the business of the partnership firm of the Shaw Wallace & Co., which had been ,doing business in India for about 60 years.
In July.
1947 the Private Limited Company was converted into a Public Limited Company.
The Head Office of the Company is at Calcutta.
It has Branches in Bombay, Delhi and Via Madras.
The general practice of the Company both at the Head Office and the Branch Offices appears to have been to retire its employees at the age of 55 though in certain cases the Company in its discretion permitted an employee to continue beyond that age.
In September, 1959 an agreement was entered into between the Company and its employees at Calcutta under which the age of retirement was extended to 58 years subject to the employees passing a medical examination on reaching the age ,of 55.
Shortly after this the Company 's employees at Bombay raised a dispute regarding their retirement age.
They claimed that no workman should be retired from service before he bad completed 60 years of age.
This dispute was ultimately referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra.
Before the Tribunal the Company resisted the workmen 's claim but submitted that it was agreeable to introduce for its Bombay employees provisions similar to those which had been introduced by agreement for the Calcutta employees retirement at the age of 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination on reaching the age of 55.
The Tribunal has directed that the age of retirement should be 58 but the Company may in its discretion and with the express or implied consent of the employee concerned continue an employee after he attains that age.
It is against this decision that the present appeal has been filed by the workmen.
As has already been noticed there is no dispute that the age of compulsory retirement should not remain at 55.
The dispute is whether it should be fixed at 58 or at 60.
It is interesting to refer in this connection to the information that has been collected by the Pay Commission (1957 59) as regards the pensionable ages prescribed under the Pension Insurance Schemes for employees generally or for industrial 426 employees and under social assistance or universal schemes in forty eight countries in 1954.
According to this the pensionable age is 70 in two countries; 67 in another two; 65 in twenty four, 60 in seventeen, 55 in two and 50 in one.
Thus out of 48 countries for which information was available it was found that in 45 countries the pensionable age was fixed at 60 or more.
As the Pay Commission Report pointed out: ""This is particularly remarkable, considering that the countries differ widely in demographic constitution, levels of economic development, and climatic and social condition; and it indicates a virtual unanimity of competent opinion that balancing the various factors physiological, economic and social that are relevant, the normal working life should continue up to the age of 60, and may well go on up to 65 years.
It is undoubtedly more useful, however, and indeed essential for our present purpose to examine the trends in this matter in our own country and specially in the region in which the present dispute has arisen.
In the delicate task of adjust ing needs of the employees to the interests of the employers and what is even more important to the general interests of the country at large, industrial adjudication has to pay special attention to the prevailing practice in the industrial region concerned.
If in any particular region employees have been successful in their claim for fixing the age of retirement at 60 this very success is bound to raise in others in the region similar expectations.
Refusal of similar relief to them is likely to create discontent.
It is the endeavour of industrial adjudication to prevent this.
That is why on questions of age of retirement and hours of work and other similar matters industrial tribunals attach much weight to what has been done in other industrial concerns in the neighbourhood in recent timeswhether by agreement or by adjudication.
In support of their demand for fixing the age of retirement at 60 the workmen tried to show that in recent years at least the tendency in comparable concerns in Bombay region has been to fix the retirement age at 60.
The Chart which is marked exhibit U 5 mentions 50 concerns in which the age of retirement is 60.
In several of these this age had been fixed as far back as 1950 while in the rest the age was fixed in later years, that is, between 1952 and 1961.
The workmen claim that these showed clearly a tendency in the Bombay region to fix the age of retirement in comparable concerns at 60.
Special emphasis was naturally placed on some decisions of this Court which contained pronouncements as regards the existence of such a trend.
In Imperial Chemical Industries 427 (India) Private Ltd., vs The Workmen(1) where the Tribunal had raised the age of retirement from 55 to 58 and both parties appealed, this Court pointed out that one of the documents on the record ""would conclusively show that in Bombay the age of retirement is almost invariably fixed at 60 and not at 55"".
In an earlier decision of this Court in Dunzlop Rubber Co. Ltd., vs Workmen(2) it had been urged that the employer was an All India concern and that changing the terms and conditions of service in regard to the age of retirement in one place might unsettle the uniformity and might have serious repercussions in other branches.
The Court pointed out that though this was a relevant consideration its effect had to be judged in the light of other material and relevant circumstances, and that one of the important material considerations in this connection would be that the age of retirement can be and often is determined on industry cum region basis.
The Court then took into account the fact that the Tribunal had found that in all the awards in recent times in various concerns in Bombay region the trend had been to fix the age of retire ment at 60 years.
It was mainly in view of this finding of the Tribunal that this Court refused to disturb the award fixing the age of retirement at 60 years.
It is important to notice that the correctness of the Tribunal 's finding that in all the awards in recent times in the Bombay region the trend had been to fix the retirement age at 60 years, was not challenged before this Court In the present case an attempt appears to have been made on behalf of the respondent Company to show that it was not correct to say that the trend in Bombay region had been to fix the age of retirement at 60.
Reliance was placed for this purpose on the Chart exhibit Cl.
It appears that the res pondent company wrote to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce to ascertain from its member concerns as regards the age of retirement observed by them and the information received from some of them was incorporated in this Chart.
The work men objected to this being received in evidence on the ground that the original letters had not been brought on the record.
It is not however seriously disputed that the Chart correctly reproduces the information as regards the age of retirement given by the various concerns named there.
We think therefore that the objection was rightly rejected by the Tribunal.
This Chart shows the age of retirement for 75 concerns.
In most of the cases the age of retirement is shown as 55 and in a few at 58.
At first sight therefore it appears to afford impressive (1) ; (2) ; 428 testimony against the workmen 's case that the recent trend in Bombay has been to fix the age of retirement at 60.
But on a closer examination it is clear that this document is of little assistance for finding out the recent trend.
There is no indication at all as to how long ago the age of retirement in these concerns was fixed at 55 or at 58.
The Statement filed by the workmen to explain this Chart shows that in two of these cases ' viz., Ingerzoll Band and Northern Assurance Co., the demand for fixing the age of retirement at 60 years is under negotiation.
Exhibit U 6 also shows that in 25 of these concerns the clerical and subordinate staff were not organised into trade unions.
There is thus good ground for thinking that the. reason why these concerns have kept the age of retirement at 55 or 58 are special to them and do not show any recent trend in the matter.
In spite of these infirmities this document, exhibit Cl, appears to have impressed the Tribunal.
The main diffi culty in accepting the Company 's case on this point, viz., the pronouncements of this Court, however, remained.
So, the Tribunal considered it to be its duty to enquire whether the conclusion recorded by this Court in some of its earlier decisions as to the relevant trend in the Bombay region was accurate.
Having embarked an this enquiry, the Tribunal, appears to have taken considerable pains to perform this duty and it has ultimately persuaded itself to hold that no such trend is established in fact.
We ought to add in this connection, that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in dealing with this aspect of the problem is not very commendable, and that its present conclusion that what was said by itself on an earlier occasion and was confirmed by this Court in appeal, was in fact inaccurate, is on the whole unsound.
If this Court had erred in making those pronouncements we would be the first to admit such mistakes and to correct the error.
After careful consideration of all the materials placed on this record, we have, however, found nothing to justify any doubt about the correctness of what was said on the earlier occasion.
On the contrary, the awards and agreements on the question of age of retirement about which information is furnished by the several documents on this record clearly show a consistent trend in the Bombay region to fix the retirement age of clerical and subordinate staff at 60.
The very few departures from this practice which the Tribunal has mentioned are, in our opinion, wholly insufficient to indicate any slowing down of this trend.
What the Tribunal has failed to notice is that instances which may justify a revision of the judicial opinion expressed on an earlier occasion about a particular trend must be strong and unambiguous and they must speak for the period both before and more particularly after the previous finding had been recorded in the matter.
429 Notice has also to be taken in this connection of the Report of the Norms Committee in which the following opinion was expressed: ""After taking into consideration the views of the earlier Committees and Commissions including those of the Second Pay Commission the report of which has been released recently, we feel that the retirement age for workmen in all industries should be fixed at 60.
Accordingly, the norm for retirement age is fixed at 60"".
This considered opinion of a Committee on which both employers and employees were represented emphasised the fact that in the Bombay region at least there is a general agree ment that the age of retirement should be fixed at 60.
The Tribunal has referred to these observations, but has brushed them aside in a way for which we find no justification.
On a consideration of all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the oral and documentary evidence on this record, we have come to the conclusion that the age of retirement of the appellant workmen should be fixed at 60.
Accordingly, we allow the appeal with costs, and in modi fication of the award made by the Tribunal direct that the age of retirement for the workmen of the respondent be fixed at 60.
Appeal allowed.
","Shortly after the extension of the age of retirement from 55 to 58 subject to the employee passing a medical examination at 55 in the respondent company 's Head Office at Calcutta, their workmen at Bombay branch raised an industrial dispute claiming the extension of their age of retirement from 55 to 60.
The dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal.
The company resisted the claim but was agreeable to introduce similar provisions as introduced at Calcutta.
The difficulty in accepting the company 's case was the conclusion recorded by the Supreme Court in its earlier decisions that the trend in Bombay region was to fix the age at 60.
So the Tribunal considered it to be its duty to enquire whether the conclusion recorded by the Supreme Court was accurate and ultimately persuaded itself to hold that no such trend was established in fact, and directed that the age of retirement should be 58.
Held: (i) After careful consideration of all the materials placed on this record, there was nothing to justify any doubt about the correctness of what was said on the earlier occasion by this Court.
The approach adopted by the Tribunal in dealing with this aspect of the problem is not very commendable and its present conclusion that what was said by itself on an earlier occasion and was confirmed by this Court in appeal, was in fact inaccurate, is on the whole unsound.
What the Tribunal has failed to notice is that instances which may justify a revision of the judicial opinion expressed on an earlier occasion about a particular trend must be strong and unambiguous and they must speak for the period both before and more particularly after the previous finding had been recorded in the matter.
(ii) The information furnished by the several documents on this record clearly show a consistent trend in the Bombay region to fix the retirement age of clerical and subordinate staff at 60.

1406,"Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1961.
Appeal by special leave from the Award dated March 10, 1959, of the Industrial Tribunal.
Kozhikode, in I.D. No. 89 of 1958.
A. V. Viswanatha Sastri and T. V. R. Tatachari, for the appellant, Janardan Sharma, for the resondents.
January 29.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO.J.
This is an appeal by special leave in an industrial matter.
The brief facts necessary for present purposes are these.
The appellant in a saw mill carrying on business in Kozihkode in 824 the State of Kerala.
One Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter.
It is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence.
He was caught hold of by other workmen and taken outside.
It is said that he came again a short time later at 4 30 p.m. and abused the same persons again.
Thereupon the appellant served a charge sheet on Sankaran on June 24, 1958 acting out the above facts and asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of his grave indiscipline and misconduct.
Sankaran gave an explanation the same day denying the allegations of fact made against him, though he admitted that he had come to the mill at the relevant time for taking his wages for that week.
On June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry.
The same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited.
As no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible.
On July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day.
In that order the appellant informed Sankaran that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if he was retained in the service of the appellant, and therefore it considered that no inquiry should be held.
A dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958.
The tribunal held that 825 something seemed to have happened on the afternoon of June 21, 1958 but there was no evidence to prove what had actually happened.
It further held that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against the workman but subsequently departmental proceedings were dropped and action was taken under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders.
The tribunal was of the view that this was a colourable exercise of the power given under r. 18(a) to the appellant and therefore its action could not be upheld as a bona fide exercise of the power conferred.
The tribunal also pointed out that no attempt was made before it to defend the action taken under r. 18 (a) by proving the alleged misconduct.
Two witnesses were produced before the tribunal in connection with the alleged misconduct, but the tribunal did not rely on them on the ground that the important witnesses, namely, the Engineer, the Secretary and other members of the staff whose evidence would have been of more value had not been produced and no explanation had been given why they were not produced.
The tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers.
In the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated.
The appellant thereupon applied for special leave which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.
The main contention of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.
Rule 18 (a) is in these terms: ""When the management desires to determine the services of any permanent workmen 826 receiving 12 as.
or more as daily wages, otherwise than under rule 21, he shall be given 14 days notice or be paid 12 days wages.
"" It may be mentioned that r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.
The claim thus put forward on behalf of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders which is a term of contract between the appellant and its employees to dispense with the service of any employee at any time by just giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages.
We are of opinion that this claim of the appellant cannot be accepted, and it is too late in the day for an employer to raise such a claim for it amounts to a claim ""to hire and fire"" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication for over a long period of time now.
As far back as 1952, the Labour Appellate Tribunal had occasion to consider this matter relating to discharge by notice or in lieu thereof by payment of wages for a certain period without assigning any reason: (see Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. Etg.
vs Workers of the Company.
etc.) (1).
It was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the terminataton of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour praction the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.
Further it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice.
These observations 827 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees ' Union (1).
and Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2).
Therefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which had been given to the employee and for which a departmental inquiry was intended to be held.
The reason given by the appellant in the order terminating the services of Sankaran of July 8, 1958, namely, that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if Sankaran were retained in service, cannot be accepted at its face value; so that the necessity for an inquiry intended to be held for misconduct actually charged might be done away with.
In any case even if the inquiry was not held by the appellant and action was taken under r. 18 (a) it is now well settled, in view of the decisions cited above, that the employer could defend the action under r. 18(a) by leading evidence before the tribunal to show that there was in fact misconduct and therefore the action taken under r. 18(a) was bona fide and was not colourable exercise of the power under that rule.
But the tribunal has pointed out that the employer did not attempt to do so before it.
It satisfied itself by producing two witnesses but withholding the important witnesses on this question.
In the circumstances, if the tribunal did not accept the evidence of the two witnesses 828 who were produced it cannot be said to have gone wrong.
Learned counsel for the appellant however urges that the employer was empowered to take action under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders and having taken action under that rule, there was nothing for it to justify before the tribunal.
We have already said that this position cannot be accepted in industrial adjudication relating to termination of service of an employee and has not been accepted by industrial tribunals over a long course of years now and the view taken by industrial tribunals has been upheld by this Court in the two cases referred to above.
Learned counsel for the appellant, however, relies on the decision of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India.
(1) That was however a case of a public servant and the considerations that apply to such a case are in our opinion entirely different.
Stress was laid by the learned counsel on the observations at p. 862 where it was observed as follows: ""It is true that the misconduct, negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or inducing factor which influences the Government to take action under the terms of the contract of employment or the specific service rule, nevertheless, if a right exists under the contract or the rule, to terminate the service, the motive operating on the mind of the Government is, as Chagla C. J. has said in Srinivas Ganesh vs Union of India (2) (supra), wholly irrelevant.
It is urged that the same principle should be applied to industrial adjudication.
It is enough to say that the position of government servants stands on an entirely different footing as compared to industrial employees.
Articles 310 and 311 of the Constitution apply to government servants and it is in the 829 light of those Articles read with the Rules framed under article 309 that questions relating to termination of service of government servants have to be considered.
No such constitutional provisions have to be considered when one is dealing with industrial employees.
Further an employer cannot now press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right ""to hire and fire"" his employees.
That right is now subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders in this case, is subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts in the manner indicated above.
The appellant therefore cannot rest its case merely on r. 18 (a) and say that having acted under that rule there is nothing more to be said and that the industrial court cannot inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service under r. 18 (a).
The industrial court in our opinion has the right to inquire into the causes that might have led to termination of service even under a rule like 18(a) and if it is satisfied that the action taken under such a rule was a colourable exercise of power and was not bona fide or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.
In this case the tribunal held that the exercise of power was colourable and it cannot be said that view is incorrect.
The appellant failed to satisfy the tribunal when the matter came before it for adjudication that the exercise of the power in this case was bona fide and was not colourable.
It could have easily done so by producing satisfactory evidence; but it seems to have rested upon its right that no such justification was required and therefore having failed to justify its action must suffer the consequences.
Learned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to another decision of this Court in 830 The Patna Electric Supply Co. Ltd. Patna vs Bali Rai(1).
That case in our opinion has no application to the facts of this case because that case dealt with an application under section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act while the present proceedings are under section 10 of the Act and the considerations which apply under section 33 are different in many respects from those which apply to an adjudication under section 10.
The appeal therefore fails and is hereby dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","S, employed by the appellant as a cross cutter in the saw mill was asked to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of grave indiscipline and misconduct and he denied the allegations of fact.
He was thereafter informed about a department enquiry to be held against him and was suspended pending enquiry.
Purporting to act under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, the appellant terminated the services of S, without holding any departmental enquiry.
The industrial tribunal to which the dispute was referred held, that action taken, after dropping the proposed departmental proceedings was not bonafide and was a colourable exercise of the powerconferred under r. 18(a) of the Standing order and since no attempt was made before it to defend such action by proving the alleged misconduct, it passed an order for reinstatement of S, The appellant contended that as the termination was strictly in accordance with the terms of contract under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, it was entitled to dispense 823 with the service of an employee at any time by first giving 14 days notice or, paying 12 days wages.
^ Held, that the employer 's decision to discharge the employee under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders after dropping the enquiry intended to be held for misconduct was clearly a colourable exercise of the power, and an employer could not press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right ""to hire and fire"" his employees, right was subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18(a) of the Standing orders in this case was subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts.
Even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides was essential and if the termination of service was a colourable exercise of power, or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice, the tribunal had jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.

3893,"N: Criminal Appeal No. 332 of 1977.
Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 20 10 75 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Application No. 1 379/75.
77 M. C. Bhandare, A. N. Karkhanis, Miss Malini Panduval and Mrs. section Bhandare for the Appellant.
G. L. Sanghi and A. K. Verma for Respondent No. 1.
M. N. Shroff for Respondent No. 2.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by A Prefatory statement KRISHNA IYER, J.
In this appeal, by special leave, we are called upon to interpret a benign provision enacted to ameliorate the economic condition of neglected wives and discarded divorcees, namely.
s 125.
P.C. Welfare laws must be so read as to be effective delivery systems of the salutary objects sought to be served by the Legislature and when the beneficiaries are the weaker sections, like destitute women, this spirit of article 15(3) of the Constitution must belight the meaning of the Section.
The Constitution is a pervasive omnipresence brooding over the meaning and transforming the values of every measure.
So, section 125 and sister clauses must receive a compassionate expansion of sense that the words used permit.
The Brief Facts The respondent (husband) married the appellant (wife) as a second wife, way back in 1956, and a few years later had a son by her.
15 The initial warmth vanished and the jealousies of a triangular situation erupted, marring mutual affection.
The respondent divorced the appellant around July 1962.
A suit relating to a flat in which the husband had housed the wife resulted in a consent decree which also settled the marital disputes.
For instance, it recited that this respondent had transferred the suit premises, namely, a flat in Bombay, to the appellant and also the shares of the Cooperative Housing Society which built the flat concerned.
There was a reference to mehar money (Rs. 5,000/ and 'iddat ' money, Rs. 180/ ) which was also stated to have been adjusted by the compromise terms.
There was a clause in the compromise: G ""The plaintiff declares that she has now no claim or right whatsoever against the defendant or against the estate and the properties of the defendant.
"" And another term in the settlement was that the appellant had by virtue of the compromise become the absolute owner of the flat and various deposits in respect of the said flat made with the cooperative housing society.
78 For some time there was flickering improvement in the relations between the quondum husband and the quondum wife and they lived together.
Thereafter, again they separated, became entranged.
The appellant, finding herself in financial straits and unable to maintain herself, moved the magistrate under section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, for a monthly allowance for the maintenance of herself and her child.
She proceeded on the footing that she was still a wife while the respondent rejected this status and asserted that she was a divorce and therefore ineligible for maintenance.
The Magistrate who tried the petition for maintenance held that the appellant was a subsisting wife and awarded monthly maintenance of Rs. 300/ for the son and Rs. 400/ for the mother for their subsistence, taking due note of the fact that the cost of living in Bombay, where the parties lived, was high, and that the respondent had provided residential accommodation to the appellant.
This order was challenged before the sessions Judge by the aggrieved husband, who on a strange view of the law that the court, under section 125, had no jurisdication to consider whether the applicant was a wife, dismissed the petition in allowance of the appeal.
The High Court deigned to bestow little attention on the matter and summarily dismissed a revision petition.
This protracted and fluctuating litigation misfortune has leu to the appeal, by special leave, before this Court.
The Questions Mooted Shri Bhandare appearing for the appellant contended that the Courts below had surprisingly forgotten the plain provision in the Explanation (b) to section 125(1) of the Code, which reads: ""wife ' includes a woman who has been divorced by.
or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and has not remarried.
On this foundation, he urged that accepting the contention of the respondent that the appellant was a divorcee? his client was still entitled to an allowance.
This is obviously beyond dispute or.
a simple reading of the sub section and it is curious how this innovative and sensitive provision with a benignant disposition towards destitute divorcees has been overlooked by all the courts below.
We hold that every divorce otherwise eligible, is entitled to the benefit of maintenance allowance and the dissolution of the marriage makes no difference to this right under the current Code.
In the normal course, an order for maintenance must follow, the quantum having been determined by the learned Magistrate at the trial level.
79 However, Shri Sanghi, appearing for the respondent, sought sustain the order in his favour on three grounds They arc of pubic importance since the affected party in such a fact situation is the neglected divorcee.
He first argued that section 125(4) would apply in the absence of proof that the lady was not living separately by mutual consent.
His next plea was that there must be proof of neglect to maintain to attract s.125 and his third contention was that there was a settlement by consent decree in 1962 whereby the mehar money had been paid and all claims adjusted, and so no claim for maintenance could survive.
The third contention is apparently based upon contractual arrangement in the consent decree read with section 127(3) (b) which reads: C ""(b) the woman has been divorced by her husband and that she has received, whether before or after the date of the said order, the whole of the sum which, under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties, was payable on such divorce cancel such order, (i) in the case where such sum was paid before such order, from the date on which such order was made.
(ii) in any other case, from the date of expiry of the period, if any, for which maintenance has been actually paid by the husband to the woman; We must state, however, that there was no specific plea, based upon the latter provision, set up anywhere in the courts below or urged before us.
But if one were to locate a legal ground to raise The contention That the liability to pay maintenance had ceased on account of the payment of mehar, it is section 127(3) of the Code.
So we must deal with the dual sub heads of the third ground.
The meaning of meanings is! derived from values in a given society and its legal system.
Art.15(3) has compelling, compassionate relevance in the context of section 125 and the benefit of doubt.
If any in statutory interpretation belongs to the ill used wife and the derelict divorcee.
This social perspective granted, the resolution of all the disputes projected is easy.
Surely, Parliament, in keeping with article 15(3) and deliberate by design, made a special provision to help women in distress cast away by divorce.
Protection against moral and material abandonment manifest in article 39 is part of social and economic justice, specificated in article 38, fulfilment of which is fundamental to the governance of the country (Art.37).
From this coign of vantage we must view the printed text of the particular Code.
80 section 125 requires, as a sine qua non for its application, neglect by husband or father.
The magistrate 's order proceeds on neglect to maintain; the sessions judge has spoken nothing to the contrary; and The High Court has not spoken at all.
Moreover, the husband has not examined himself to prove that he has been giving allowances to the divorced wife.
His case, on the contrary, is that she has forfeited her claim because of divorce and the consent decree.
Obviously, he has no case of non neglect.
His plea is his right to ignore.
So the basic condition of neglect to maintain is satisfied.
In this generous jurisdiction, a broader perception and appreciation of the facts and their bearing must govern the verdict not chopping little logic or tinkering with burden of proof.
The next submission is that the absence of mutual consent to live separately must be made out if the hurdle of section 125(4) is to be over come.
We see hardly any force in this plea.
The compulsive conclusion from a divorce by a husband and his provision of a separate residence as evidenced by the consent decree fills the bill.
Do divorcees have to 1) prove mutual consent to live apart? Divorce painfully implies that the husband orders her out of the conjugal home.
If law has nexus with life this argument is still born.
The last defence, based on mehar payment, merits more serious attention.
The contractual limb of the contention must easily fail.
The consent decree of 1962 resolved all disputes and settled all claims then available But here is a new statutory right created as a projection of public policy by the Code of 1973, which could not have been in the contemplation of the parties when in 1962, they entered into a contract to adjust their then mutual rights.
No settlement of claims which does not have the special statutory right of the divorcee under section 125 can operate to negate that claim.
Nor can s.127 rescue the respondent from his obligation.
Payment of mehar money, as a customary discharge, is within the cognisance of that provision.
But what was the amount of mehar ? Rs. 5000/ , interest from which could not keep the woman 's body and soul together for a day, even in that city where 40% of the population are reported to live on pavements, unless she was ready to sell her body and give up her soul ? The point must be clearly under stood that the scheme of the complex of provisions in Chapter IX has a social purpose.
Ill used wives and desparate divorcees shall not be driven to material and moral dereliction to seek sanctuary in the streets.
This traumatic horror animates the amplitude of s.127.
Where the husband, by customary payment at the time of divorce, has adequately provided for the divorce, a subsequent series of recurrent does is 81 contra indicated and the husband liberated.
This is the teleological A interpretation, the sociological decoding of the text of s.127.
The keynote thought is adequacy of payment which will take reasonable care of her maintenance.
The payment of illusory amounts by way of customary or personal law requirement will be considered in the reduction of maintenance rate but cannot annihilate that rate unless it is a reasonable substitute.
The legal sanctity of the payment is certified by the fulfilment of the social obligation, not by a ritual exercise rooted in custom.
No construction which leads to frustration of the statutory project can secure validation if the court is to pay true homage to the Constitution.
The only just construction of the section is that Parliament intended divorcees should not derive a double benefit.
If the first payment by way of mehar or ordained by custom has a reasonable relation to the object and is a capitalised substitute for the order under section 125 not mathematically but fairly then section 127(3) (b) subserves the goal and relieves; the obligor, not pro tanto but wholly.
The purpose of the payment 'under any customary or personal law ' must be to obviate destitution of the divorcee and to provide her with wherewithal to maintain herself.
The whole scheme of section 127(3) (b) is manifestly to recognise the substitute maintenance arrangement by lump sum payment organised by the custom of the community or the personal law of the parties.
There must be a rational relation between the sum so paid and its potential as provision for maintenance.
To interpret otherwise is to stultify the project.
Law is dynamic and its meaning cannot he pedantic but purposeful.
The proposition, therefore, is that no husband can claim under section 127(3)(b) absolution from this obligation under section 125 towards a divorced wife except on proof of payment of a sum stipulated by customary or personal law whose quantum is more or less sufficient to do duty for maintenance allowance.
The conclusion that we therefore reach is that the appeal should be allowed and it is hereby allowed, and the order of the trial court restored.
P.B.R. Appeal allowed.
","Explanation (b) to section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides that ""wife"" includes a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not re married.
Section 127(3) (b) provides that where any order has been made under section 125 in favour of a woman who has been divorced by or has obtained a divorce from her husband, the Magistrate shall if he is satisfied that the woman has been divorced by her husband and has received, whether before or after the date of the said order, the whole of the sum which under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties, was payable on such divorce cancel such order in the circumstances stated therein.
The respondent (husband) married the appellant (wife) and had a son by her.
A few years later the respondent divorced his wife.
By a consent decree, in the suit filed by the wife, he transferred to her the flat in which she was living and agreed to pay mehar money.
The compromise stated that the ""plaintiff declares that she has now no claim or right whatsoever against the defendant"".
For some time thereafter they lived together but again separated.
The wife moved the magistrate under section 125 Cr.P. for grant of maintenance to her and her son.
This was granted.
On appeal the Sessions Judge held mat the Court had no jurisdiction under section 125.
The High Court dismissed the wife 's appeal.
On further appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the respondent that (i) section 125(4) would apply in the absence of proof that the wife was not living separately by mutual consent; (ii) to attract section 125 there must be proof of neglect to maintain the wife and (iii) no claim for maintenance in this case can survive in the face of the consent decree whereby mehar money had been paid and all claims adjusted.
Allowing the appeal the Court, G ^ HELD: Every divorcee, otherwise eligible, is entitled to the benefit of maintenance allowance and the dissolution of the marriage makes no difference to this right under the current Code.

5397,"No. 7338 of 1981.
(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).
Ram Jethmalani and Miss Rani Jethmalani for the Petitioner.
G. Ramaswamy, Additional Solicitor General, R.P. Srivastava 634 and Miss. A. Subhashini for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATH MISRA, J.
The petitioner of this application under Article 32 of the Constitution is an engineer who was employed in the Central Public Works Department under the Ministry of Works and Housing in Government of India and was compulsorily retired by order dated 3.8.1976 with effect from 5.11.1976 made under Rule 56(j) of the Fundamental Rules.
He has assailed that order for retirement and has claimed payment of remuneration which he would have been entitled to draw upto the normal date of superannuation.
The short facts are these.
The petitioner was born on 10.2.1922 and secured his first appointment as a Section Officer under the named employer on 22.10.1947.
He was pro moted as officiating Assistant Engineer in class II service with effect from ' 25.5.
1954, and came to be confirmed as Section Officer by an order dated 8.10.1955.
On 3.7.1961, he was further promoted as officiating Executive Engineer in Class I service but on 4.9.1965, he was reverted to the post of Assistant Engineer in officiating position and was con tinuing in that post when he was compulsorily retired.
The vires of Rule 56(j) of the Fundamental Rules as also the power to compulsorily retire a public servant have been upheld by this Court and do not require to be re examined.
The basis of attack to the impugned order is as specified in Ground No. A and is to the following effect: ""The impugned order is contrary to the judg ment delivered by this Hon 'ble Court on 26.2.1980, copy at Annexure C hereto.
(Union of India vs K.R. Tahiliani and Anr.) [1980] 1 SLR 847.
According to the said judgment F.R. 56 (j)(i) has no application to officiating government servants, hence can have no appli cation to the petitioner since the petitioner was an officiating government servant.
"" The impugned notice ran thus: ""No. 32/452/66 EC.
111 Government of India Central Public Works Department New Delhi, the 3.8.76 635 ORDER WHEREAS the Engineer in Chief is of opinion that it is in public interest to do so: NOW, THEREFORE, in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (j) of Rule 56 of the Fundamental Rules, the Engineer in Chief hereby gives notice to Shri A.L. Ahuja, As sistant Engineer (Civil), at present under suspension, that he, having already attained the age of fifty years on 10.2.1972, shall retire from service with effect from the forenoon of 3rd November, 1976, or, from the date of expiry of three months computed from the date of issue of the service of this notice on him, whichever is latter.
Sd/ (V.R .
VAISH) ENGINEER IN CHIEF To Shri A.L. Ahuja, Assistant Engineer (Civil), (Under Suspension), A11/85, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi 110024.
"" It is clear from it that the petitioner attained the age of 50 years on 10.2.1972 and, therefore, on the date of the order he had completed the age of 54 years.
Admittedly, he was holding a class II post when the impugned order was served on him.
Fundamental Rule 56(j) under which notice was given provides: ""(j) Notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, the appropriate authority shall, if it is of the opinion that it is in the public interest so to do, have the absolute right to retire any Government servant by giving him notice of not less than three months in writ ing or three months ' pay and allowances in lieu of such notice; (i) if he is in Class I or Class II service or post (and had entered Government service before attaining the age 636 of thirty five years), after he has attained the age of fifty years; (ii) in any other case after he has attained the age of fifty five years; . . . . . . . . . . ."" The appropriate authority is entitled to exercise power under clause (j) in the case of a Government servant in Class I or Class II service or post where he entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years after the said servant attained the age of 50 years; and in other cases after he has attained the age of 55 years.
In the instant case, the petitioner was promoted as officiating Assistant Engineer which is a Class II post on 25.5.
1954 and contin ued to hold that post when the order of compulsory retire ment was passed.
By 25.5.1954 the petitioner had not at tained the age of 35 years.
As already indicated above he had crossed the age of 50 years but had not attained the age of 55 years by the date of the impugned order.
Therefore, sub clause (1) was not contravened when the order was made.
It has been argued before us that as the petitioner was holding an officiating appointment in Class 117 he could not have been compulsorily retired under sub clause (i).
Support is claimed from the observations in the Tahilia ni 's case (supra).
The sole question that fell therein for decision before this Court was whether a Government servant officiating in Class I or Class II service or post could be retired compulsorily by exercising the power under Rule 56(j)(i) after he has attained the age of 50 years.
The two Judge Bench which decided the case held: "" An officiating hand has no right to the post and is perhaps a fleeting.
bird who may have to go back to the substantive post from which he has been promoted on an officiating basis what is more to the point, a person who has been appointed de novo may begin his service on an officiating basis or on a tempo rary basis and it is obvious that he has no right to the post and cannot be strictly said to be in that service or post as a member of that service.
In short, an officiating Govern ment servant does not really belong to Class I or Class II service until he acquires a right thereon.
Even viewed closely and meticulously, the structure of the clause, namely, ""if he is in Class I or Class II 637 service or post"", emphasises the nature of the service or post vis a vis the Government servant concerned.
We need not go into the semantic shapes, lexical niceties or linguis tic nuance but only go through the meaning and purpose of the provision.
When a Government servant belonging to a Class I or Class II service or post on regular basis has to be retired compulsorily, Rule 56(j)(i) comes to the rescue of the Government.
But if he is only a temporary hand, he has no right to the post and can always be reverted to the post, if any, on which he has a lien.
Similar is the position of an officiating hand.
Thus we have reached an inevitable conclusion that Rule 56(j) is meant to cover only those who are in a post on a regular basis, i.e. in a substan tive capacity, and not on an officiating basis only.
"" Strong reliance was placed by counsel for the petitioner on the reasons extracted above.
It is clear that sub clause (ii) is the general rule applicable to all Government servants and sub clause (i) carves out a class of Government servants into a category and makes a special provision.
We have already indicated that sub clause (ii) did not apply to the facts of this case as the petitioner had not attained the age of 55 years by the date of the order.
The observations made in Tahiliani 's case indisputably support the petitioner.
But the correct ness thereof is disputed by learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India and that is why this writ petition was directed to be heard by a larger Bench.
There is no reference to officiating service in sub clause (i).
The relevant words used in sub clause (i) are ""if he is in Class I or Class II service or post"".
A person can be in Class I or Class II service or post even when he hold a post of either class substantively or temporarily or on officiating basis.
Instances are abundant where officers are promoted to Class I or Class II service or post of such class on officiating basis and such officiation lasts for a number of years.
Officiating promotion certainly does not confer a right to the post and at any time the Government servant may be sent back to his substantive post.
There is, however, no reasons why sub clause (i) should be confined to service or post held on substantive basis.
Learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the position that a person who is in Class I or Class II service or post is in such service or post as covered by sub clause (i).
The possibility of such incumbent being sent back to the 638 substantive post is not at all relevant in the matter of exercising powers of compulsory retirement.
If the officia tion is not brought to an end by reverting the Government servant to his substantive post before the power of compul sory retirement is exercised, the Government servant con cerned must be taken to be in Class I or Class II service or post at the relevant time and would come within the ambit of sub clause (i).
There is no warrant for the conclusion that officiating Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post are outside the purview of sub clause (i).
The possibility of a reversion to the substantive post is not germane to the exercise of power contained in F.R. 56.
The purpose of Fundamental Rules 56(j) is to confer power on the appropriate authority to compulsorily retire Government servant in the public interest and the classification of Government servants into two categories covered by sub clauses (i) and (ii) has a purpose behind it.
If the condi tion indicated in sub clause (i) is satisfied, namely, the Government servant is in Class I or Class II service or post and he had entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years, and has attained the age of fifty, the further condition that he must substantively belong to the two classes of service or post cannot be introduced into the scheme.
The purpose of the sub clauses is to classify Gov ernment servants into two categories and sub clause (i) takes within its sweep those Government servants who at the relevant time are in Class I or Class II service or post, whether substantively, temporarily or on officiating basis.
We would accordingly hold that the ratio of the decision in Tahiliani 's case is not correct and sub clause (i) of Rule 56(j) applies to Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post on substantive, temporary or offi ciating basis.
On this conclusion the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
It has been represented to us by counsel for the petitioner that the similarly placed persons had gone before the Delhi High Court challenging the orders of compulsory retirement and the Delhi High Court relying upon Tahiliani 's case give them relief.
Such judgments have become final and Union of India has given effect to the decisions of the Delhi High Court.
When this was put to learned Additional Solicitor General he agreed that the Union of India will have no objection to treat the petitioner alike and would be prepared to give the same relief to the petitioner.
The petitioner would have superannuated from service on 29.2.1980 if he had not been compulsorily retired with effect from 639 5.11. 1976.
Even if the writ petition is allowed and the order of compulsory retirement is set aside the petitioner cannot go back to service.
But he would be entitled to pecuniary benefit of salary and allowances admissible under the rules.
Accordingly, we allow the.writ petition and direct the respondent to pay to the petitioner the salary and other allowances which would have been payable for the period between 5.11.
1976 and 29.2.
Such payment be made within two months from today.
There will be no order for costs.
WRIT PETITION NOS.
6251 & 8189 OF 1981 Each of the petitioners in these two writ applications under Article 32 of the Constitution was employed in the Central Public Works Department in the Ministry of Works and Housing of Government of India and has been compulsorily retired under Fundamental Rule 56(j).
The facts of each of these applications are more or less similar to those in Writ Petition No. 7338 of 1981 which we have disposed of today.
For the reasons given therein we allow each of the writ petitions and quash the order of compulsory retirement made against each of the petitioners.
By now both the petitioners would have retired from service and, therefore, they cannot be resorted in service.
They would, however, be entitled to salary and other service allowances payable to them from the date of compulsory retirement till the date of their normal superannuation.
There will be no order for costs.
H.L.C. Petition allowed.
","Fundamental Rule 56(j) confers power on the appropriate authority to compulsorily retire a Government servant, if it is in the public interest to do so, by giving 3 months ' notice or 3 months ' pay and allowances in lieu of such notice; while sub cl.
(i) thereof states that a public servant in class I or class II service or post who had entered service before attaining the age of 35 years can be retired after he has attained the age of 50 years, sub cl.
(ii) thereof states that any other public servant can be retired after he has attained the age of 55 years.
In Union of India vs K.R. Tahiliani & Anr., this Court had held that F.R. 56(j) is meant to cover only those who are in a post on a regular basis, i.e., in a substantive capacity, and not on an officiating basis only.
Basing his case on this decision, the petitioner, who had been compulsorily retired while working in a class II post In an officiating capacity, challenged the order of his compulsory retirement.
Overruling the decision in Union of India vs K.R. Tahi liani & Anr., but, allowing the petition on the ground that the Delhi High Court, relying upon that decision, had grant ed relief to persons similarly placed as the petitioner, and, directing payment of his salary and allowances upto the date of his normal superannuation, HELD: Sub clause (1) of r. 56(j) of the Fundamental Rules applies to Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post on substantive, temporary or officiating basis.
[638E F] There is no reference to officiating service in sub cl.
The relevant words used in sub cl.
(i) are ""if he is in CIasa I or CIasa II service or post.
"" A person can be in Class I or CIasa II service or post even when he holds a post of either ciasa substantively or temporarily or on officiating basis.
Instances are abundant where officers are promoted to CIasa I or Class II service or post of such class on officiating basis and 633 such officiation lasts for a number of years.
Officiating promotion certainly does not confer a right to the post and at any time the Government servant may be sent back to his substantive post.
There is, however, no reason why sub cl.
(i) should be confined to service or post held on substan tive basis.
It is not disputed that a person who is in Class I or Class II service or post is in such service or post as covered by sub cl.
The possibility of such incumbent being sent back to the substantive post is not at all rele vant in the matter of exercising powers of compulsory re tirement.
If the officiation is not brought to an end by reverting the Government servant to his substantive post before the power of compulsory retirement is exercised, the Government servant concerned must be taken to be in Class I or Class II service or post at the relevant time and would come within the ambit of sub cl.
There is no warrant for the conclusion that officiating Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post are outside the purview of sub cl.
The possibility of a reversion to the sub stantive post is not germane to the exercise of power con tained in F.R. 56.
[637F H; 638A C] The purpose of F.R. 56(j) is to confer power on the appropriate authority to compulsorily retire a Government servant in the public interest and the classification of Government servants into two categories covered by sub cls.
(i) and (ii) has a purpose behind it.
If the condition indicated in sub cl.
(i) is satisfied, namely, the Govern ment servant is in Class I or Class II service or post and he had entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years, and has attained the age of fifty, the further condi tion that he must substantively belong to the two classes of service or post cannot be introduced into the scheme.
The purpose of the sub clauses is to classify Government serv ants into two categories and sub cl.
(i) takes within its sweep those Government servants who at the relevant time are in Class I or Class II service or post, whether substantive ly, temporarily or on officiating basis.

2207,"Appeal No. 696 of 1966.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 13, 1963 of the Madras High Court in Writ Appeal No. IO of 1962.
P. Ram Reddy and A. V. Rangam, for the appellant.
R. Ganapathy Iyer, for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J.
The question of law involved in this appeal is whether the purchaser of business carried on by a dealer as defined in the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 (Madras Act No. IX of 1939), hereinafter called the 'Act ', can be made liable for arrears of sales tax due from the dealer in respect of transactions of sale which took place before the, transfer of the business under Rule 21 A of the Rules framed in exercise of the powers conferred on the State Government by section 19 of the Act.
The respondent purchased, by a registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the business carried on by one Purushottam Raju under the name All India Trading Company.
Purushottam Raju was the sole proprietor of the business and had been assessed to sales tax in respect of his turnover for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50.
The assessee paid some amounts towards sales tax thus determined, but there remained some arrears of sales tax i.e., Rs. 3836 4 0 for 1948 49 and Rs. 1218 1 9 for 1949 50.
The Sales tax authorities attempted to recover the arrears of tax from the respondent as the purchaser of the business.
The respondent 6 63 denied liability to pay sales tax but his contention was over ruled by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer.
The respondent appealed to the Commercial Tax Officer as well as to the Board of Revenue, but the appeals were dismissed.
The respondent thereafter moved the Madras High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ in the nature of certiorari to quash the orders of the Commercial Tax Officer and the Board of Revenue.
Ganapatia Pillai, J. who heard the petition dismissed it.
The respondent took the matter in appeal under the Letters Patent.
The Division Bench consisting of section Ramachandra Iyer, C.J. and Ramakrishnan, J. reversed the judgment of the Single Judge, holding that Rule 21 A of the Sales Tax Rules was illegal and ultra vires and the respondent was not liable to pay the sales tax due from his predecessor in title, Purushottam Raju.
This appeal is brought, by special leave, from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated September 13, 1963 in Writ Appeal No. 10 of 1962.
Rule 21 A was framed by the State Government under the rule making power granted to it under section 19(1) and (2) of the Act.
Rule 21 A reads as follows : ""When the ownership of the business of a dealer liable to pay the tax under the Act is entirely transferred, any tax payable in respect of such business and remaining unpaid at the time of the transfer shall be recoverable from the transferor or the transferee as if they were the dealers liable to pay such tax, provided that the recovery from the transferee of the arrears of taxes due prior to the date of the transfer shall be only to the extent of the value of the business he obtained by transfer.
The trans feree shall also be liable to pay tax under the Act on the sales of goods effected by him with effect from the date of such transfer and shall within thirty days of the transfer apply for registration or licence, as the case may be, unless he already holds a certificate of registration or licence, as the case may be.
"" Section 19 ( 1 ) and 1 9 (2) (c) are to the following effect ""19.
(1) The State Government may make rules to carry out the purposes of this Act.
(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for (c) the assessment to tax under this Act of businesses which are discontinued or the ownership of which has changed;"" 664 The first question to be considered in this appeal is whether Rule 21 A is intra vires of the power of the State Government under sections 19(1) and (2) of the Act.
Section 3(1) of the Act is the charging section.
It imposes a liability to pay sales tax on every dealer for each year, and the tax is to be calculated on his total turnover for that year.
Section 2(b) of the Act defines a ""dealer"" as ""a person who carries on the business of buying, selling .
goods"".
The word ""turnover"" is defined in section 2(i) of the Act to mean ""the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought or sold by a dealer, whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration. "".
It is manifest that a person who purchases a business as a 'dealer ' can be assessed to sales tax only in respect of his turnover and under the scheme of the charging provision of the Act the purchaser of the business has nothing to do with the sales effected by the seller of the business.
The turnover in respect of such sales remains therefore the turnover of the transferor and not of the transferee.
By the amending Act of 1959 (Act 1 of 1959) an express provision was inserted by which the transferee of the business was made liable for the arrears of sales tax due from the transferor.
But there is no such provision in the Act for the period with which we are concerned in the present case.
The question is whether the State Government has authority under its rule making power under section 19 of the Act to create a legal fiction by which the transferee of the business is constituted as the dealer liable to pay the tax in respect of the turnover of the transferor.
On behalf of the appellants Mr. Ram Reddy suggested that the State Government has power under section 19(1) and 19(2) (c) of the Act to frame the impugned rule.
We are unable to accept this argument as correct.
Section 19(1) of the Act empowers the State Government to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act, but the section cannot be utilised to enlarge the scope of section 10 regarding recovery and payment of tax from some other person other than a ""dealer"" under the Act.
We also consider that the State Government has no authority under section 19(2)(c) of the Act to enact the rule.
Section 19(2)(c) deals with the assessment to tax of businesses which are discontinued or the ownership of which has changed.
It is true that the word ""assessment"" in the scheme of sales tax and income tax legislation is a term of varying import.
The word is used sometimes to mean the computation of income, sometimes the determination of the amount of tax payable, and sometimes the whole procedure laid down in the Income tax Act for imposing liability on the tax payer.
As the Judicial Committee, however, said in Badridas Daga vs C.I.T (1), the words 'assess ' and 'assessment ' refer primarily to the computation of the amount.
of income.
In Chatturam vs C.I.T. Bihar(1), the Federal Court pointed out, relying upon the decision of the House of Lords in (1) , 21 1.
(2) , 665 Whitney vs Commissioners of Inland Revenue(""), that the liability to tax does not depend upon assessment.
The liability is definitely created by sections 3 and 4 of the Income tax Act which are the charging sections and the assessment order under section 23 only quantifies the liability which has already been definitely and finally created by the charging sections and the provision in regard to assessment relates only to the machinery of taxation.
In our opinion, the principle of these decisions applies to the interpretation of the Act in the present case.
We consider that, in the context and background of other sections of the Act, the word 'assessment ' used in section 19(2)(c) does not include the power of recovering tax assessed from a person other than the assessee.
It follows therefore that Rule 21 A is beyond the rule making power of the State Government either under section 19(1) or section 19(2)(c) of the Act.
It was then submitted by Mr. Ram Reddy that Rule 21 A may be supported by the language of section 10(1) of the Act which states ""10.
Payment and recovery of tax. (1) The tax assessed under this Act shall be paid in such manner and in such instalments, if any, and within such time, as may be specified in the notice of assessment, not being less than fifteen days from the date of service of the notice.
If default is made in paying according to the notice of assessment, the whole of the amount outstanding on the date of default shall become immediately due and shall be a charge on the properties of the person or persons liable to pay the tax under this Act.
"" It was contended that under this section the whole of the amount outstanding on the date of default is charged on the property of the person liable to pay the tax.
In the present case, the business which was transferred to the respondent was hence charged with the payment of sales tax and it was open to sales tax authorities to proceed against the assets of the business for realising the amount of sales tax due.
In our opinion, there is no justification for this argument.
Section 10 of the Act as it stood before the Madras General Sales tax (3rd amendment) Act, 1956 (Act No. XV of 1956) read as follows ""The tax assessed under this Act shall be paid in such manner and in such instalments, if any, and within such time, as may be specified in the notice of assessment, not being less than fifteen days from the date of service of the notice.
In default of such payment, the whole of the amount then remaining due may be recovered as if it were an arrear of land revenue.
"" This section was amended by section 8 of the Madras General Sales tax (3rd amendment) Act, 1956 which reads as follows (1) 666 ""Substitution of new section for section 10 in Madras Act IX of 1939.
For section 10 of the principal Act, the following section shall be substituted, namely ""10.
Payment and recovery of tax. (1) The tax assessed under this Act shall be paid in such manner and in such instalments, if any, and within such time, as may be specified in the notice of assessment, not being less than fifteen days from the date of service of the notice.
If default is made in paying according to the notice of assessment, the whole of the amount outstanding on the date of default shall become immediately due and shall be a charge on the properties of the person or persons liable to pay the tax under this Act. . .
The 3rd Amendment Act, 1956 received the assent of the President on October 1, 1956 but it was published in the Madras Gazette on October 8. 1956.
Section 5 of the Madras General Clauses Act (Madras Act No. 1 of 1891) provides as follows ""5.
(1) Where any Act to which this Chapter applies is not expressed to come into operation, on a particular day, then, it shall come into operation on the day on which the assent thereto of the Governor, the Gover nor General or the President, as the case may require, is first published in the Official Gazette.
"" In the present case, the Act is not expressed to come into operation on any particular date, but as it was published in the Madras Gazette on October 8, 1956, the Act came into operation on that date and not before.
In the present case, the registered instrument by which the business was transferred to the respondent is dated October 5, 1956 and the amending Act has therefore no application.
We accordingly reject the argument of the appellants on this aspect of the case and hold that Rule 21 A is ultra vires of the rule making power of the State Government under the, Act.
It was next argued on behalf of the appellants that upon a true construction of the registered instrument dated October 5, 1956 the respondent undertook to pay not only Sch.
I liabilities but also other liabilities like sales tax imposed in regard to the business.
It was, however, disputed by Mr. Ganapathy Iyer on behalf of the respondent that there was any undertaking on the part of the respondent to discharge the liabilities in regard to arrears of sales tax.
But even on the assumption that the respondent undertook to pay the arrears of sales tax due by the transferor, it does not follow 66 7 that there is a liability created inter se between the State Government on the one hand and the transferee on the other hand.
To put it differently, it is not open to the State Government to rely on the instrument inter vivos between the transferor and the transferee and to contend that there is any contractual obligation between the transferee and the State Government who is not a party to the instrument.
We accordingly reject the argument of the appellants on this aspect of the case also.
For these reasons we hold that the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court dated September 13, 1963 is correct and this appeal must be dismissed with costs.
R.K.P.S. Appeal dismissed.
","By a registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the respondent purchased the business carried on by a dealer as defined in the Madras General Sales Tax Act IX of 1939.
The dealer had been assessed to sales tax in respect of his turnover for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50 and had paid a part of the sales tax determined as due from him with the balance amount remaining in arrears.
The sales tax authorities attempted to recover the arrears from the respondent as the purchaser of the business and although he denied liability, his contention was overruled by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer.
His appeal to the Board of Revenue was also dismissed and he thereafter filed a Writ Petition under article 226 of the Constitution, challenging the orders of the C.T.O. and the Board.
A Single Bench of the High Court dismissed the appeal but a Division Bench allowed a Letters Patent Appeal holding that Rule 21 A of the Sales Tax Rules under which the arrears were sought to be recovered from the respondent, was illegal and ultra vires the Act.
In the appeal to the Supreme Court it was contended, Inter alia, on behalf of the department (i) that Rule 21 A was valid having been made in exercise of the rule making power granted to the State Government under sections 19(1) and 19(2) (c) of the Act whereby it could make rules for the assessment to tax under the Act of businesses which were discontinued or the ownership of which had changed; (ii) that further more under section 10, the whole of the amount outstanding on the date of the default was charged on the property of the person liable to pay the tax; therefore, in the present case, the business which was transferred to the respondent was charged with the payment of sales tax and it was open to the sales tax authorities to proceed against the assets of the business for realising the amount of sales tax due; and (iii) that upon a true construction of the registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, the respondent undertook to pay all liabilities like sales tax imposed in regard to the business.
HELD: dismissing the appeal: (i) Rule 21 A was beyond the rule making power of the State Government either under section 19(1) or section 19(2)(c) and was therefore ultra vires the Act.
[666 E F] Although by the amending Act 1 of 1959, an express provision was inserted by which the transferee of the business was made liable for the arrears of sales tax due from the transferor, there was no Such provision in the Act during the period covered by the present case.
[664 D] it is manifest that the person who purchases a business as a 'dealer ' can be assessed to sales tax onlY in respect of his turnover and under the scheme of the charging provision of the Act, the purchaser of the busi 662 ness has nothing to do with the sales effected by the seller of the business, The turnover in respect of such sales remains.
therefore, the turnover of the transferor and not of the transferee.
[664 C] Although section 19(2)(c) deals with the assessment to tax of businesses which are discontinued or the ownership of which has changed, in the context and background of other sections of the Act, the word ""assessment"" used in para 19(2)(c) does not include the.
power of recovering tax assessed from a person other than the assessee.

1378,"ION: Criminal Appeal 89 of 1961.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 8, 1960, of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1782 of 60 and Referred No. 125 of 1960, section K. Kapur, for the appellant, G. C. Mathur and C. P. Lal, for the respondent.
December 19.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAGUHBAR DAYAL, J.
Ram Singh appeals, by special leave, against the order of the Allahabad High Court dismissing his appeal and confirming 204 his conviction and sentence of death, under section 302, I.P.C., by the Session Judge, Etawah.
The prosecution case, in brief, is that due to enmity, the appellant caused injuries to Sheo Sahai, who was sleeping in his cattle shed in village Bhadurpur Ghar, with a sword at about mid night on the night between June 14 15, 1960.
Sheo Sahai died of the injuries received.
The appellant thereafter proceeded to the Canal Distributory at some distance from the village and had a bath there.
Later on, he went to the Police Station, Ekdil, nine miles away and lodged a report.
He delivered the sword which has been found by the Serologist to be stained with human blood.
The appellant was taken in custody and as a result of the investigation was sent up for trial, The appellant denied the allegation that he had caused the death of Sheo Sahai and alleged that he was falsely accused of the offence.
He also denied the other allegations for the prosecution.
He alleged that one Paley Singh informed him about the murder of Sheo Sahai and asked him to go to the Police Station, Ekdil, and to inform the Station Officer orally about the murder.
He did accordingly.
He was detained at the Police Station till 11 a.m., the next day and was then put up in the lock up.
The Sub Inspector took his thumb impression forcibly on three papers, but did not tell him the reason.
The appellant adduced no evidence in support of his statement.
The Courts below rightly did not accept his version.
The evidence led by the prosecution consisted of the evidence relating to motive, to his extrajudicial confession to one Ujagar Singh when he was having a bath in the Canal, to his purchasing the sword and to his delivering it at the police Station after he had dictated the report.
Both the Courts below rightly believed the evidence about the motive and purchase of the sword by the appellant.
205 The learned Sessions Judge believed Ujagar Singh and acted on the extra judicial confession made by the appellant to him.
The High Court, however, did not rely on this extra judicial confession.
It relied on certain statements made by the appellant in his report dictated at the Police Station and considered those facts together with the motive and the evidence about the purchase of the sword sufficient to confirm the appellant 's conviction and sentence.
The learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the entire report dictated by the appellant was inadmissible in evidence as its contents amounted to a confession of the offence by the appellant made to a Police Officer and that the evidence relied upon by the High Court was insufficient to establish that the appellant had murdered Sheo Sahai.
On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent urged that the High Court was wrong in rejecting the statement of Ujagar Singh about the appellant 's extra judicial confession and that the extra judicial confession together with the circumstances relied on by the High Court, fully make out the prosecution case against the appellant.
He also urges that such portions of the report which did not amount to a direct admission of the appellant 's striking Sheo Sahai with a sword and thereby causing his death were admissible in evidence.
We do not consider it necessary to decide whether any portion of the report dictated by the appellant at the Police Station is admissible or not in evidence, as there is good independent evidence with respect to the four matters mentioned in the report and relied on by the High Court in considering the case against the appellant.
These admissions of the appellant are (i) that he purchased a cycle from the deceased; (ii) that there was a quarrel in a play of cards; (iii) that he purchased a sword; and (iv) that he deposited the sword at the Police Station.
206 Ajit Singh, P.W., 5 deposed about the purchase of the cycle and about a dispute taking place between Sheo Sahai and the appellant on account of the latter 's demanding the return of Rs. 10/ which had been paid towards the sale price as the balance of the sale price had not been paid and the deal was cancelled by Sheo Sahai in accordance with the oral contract.
Ajit Singh bears no enmity with the appellant.
In fact, none of the prosecution witnesses is alleged to bear enmity with the appellant.
Paley Singh, P.W. 2, and Baij Nath P.W. 4, depose about the dispute during the game of cards played on June 12, 1960.
Kehar Singh P.W.3.
deposed about the selling of a sword to the appellant on June 13, 1960.
A receipt about the sale was found on the person of the appellant when he was searched after his arrest.
The appellant 's depositing the sword at the Police Station is deposed by Madho Ram P.W. 12, and by Sri Kishan Singh, Station Officer, Ekdil, (P.W. 16), in whose presence the appellant had dictated the report.
It is therefore not necessary to rely on the admissions of the appellant in the report with respect to these facts deposed to by the various witnesses whose testimony has been rightly accepted.
We need also consider whether the facts that the accused had a motive to harm Sheo Sahai and that he had purchased a sword a day before the incident and deposited it stained with human blood at the Police Station on the night of the murder are sufficient to establish that it must be the appellant who committed the murder of Sheo Sahai or not, as we are of opinion that the High Court erred in rejecting the statement of Ujagar Singh about the appellant 's confessing to him that he had murdered Sheo Sahai.
207 In this connection, the High Court simply said: ""A perusal of the statement of Ujagar Singh would show that it is very likely that this may have happened.
To us, it seems that in the middle of June when the chari and sugar cane crop would not have been very high, it seems improbable that Ujagar Singh would have been sleeping in his field or that he should have met the appellant in the manner alleged.
We do not feel sure of the extra judicial confession said to have been made by the appellant to Ujagar Singh, and consequently we do not place any reliance on his statement, though it has been relied upon by the court below.
"" With respect to the learned Judges, these observations are not very consistent.
If Ujagar Singh 's statement made it very likely that what he stated did happen, there could not have appeared any improbability in Ujagar Singh 's sleeping in his field and meeting the appellant in the manner alleged, especially when the learned Judges believed, and there was evidence about it, that the fields had chari and sugarcane crop at the time.
The learned Judges have not stated those considerations, if any, in addition to the improbability of Ujagar Singh 's presence in his field on account of the crops being not very high, which made them doubt the appellant 's confessing to Ujagar Singh.
It may be mentioned that Ujagar Singh was on the field, according to his statement, for protecting the crop from the depradations of neel gais.
They damage the leaves of the plants and have no partiality for tall plants alone.
In fact, the smaller the plants, the easier it must be to graze.
The learned Sessions Judge has discussed the criticism urged before him against the acceptance of the statement of Ujagar Singh and considered 208 it, for reasons given, not to justify the rejection of Ujagar Singh 's statement.
We agree with those reasons.
There is no enmity between Ujagar Singh and the appellant and therefore no good reasons existed for Ujagar Singh to state falsely.
Extra judicial confessions are not usually considered with favour but that does not mean that such a confession coming from a person who has no reason to state falsely and to whom it is made in circumstances which tend to support his statement, should not be believed.
The murder was committed in the month of June.
Both on account of the temperature and on account of the culprit 's desire to wash of blood marks on his person, the appellant 's bathing in the Canal at that hour of the night cannot be said to be improbable.
It is not stated by sub Inspector Kishan Singh, nor it is alleged that the appellant had on his person or on his clothes blood stains when he presented himself at the Police Station.
This tends to support Ujagar Singh 's statement that the appellant had a bath in the Canal at that hour.
Of course, this consideration springs out of the supposition that the appellant did commit the murder.
The fact that he had the sword which was stained with human blood, leads to such a supposition, even if the mere possession of a sword so stained be not sufficient to establish conclusively that the person who possessed it so shortly after the murder of a person with whom he had enmity, had committed the murder.
The Canal runs beside Ujagar Singh 's field.
Ujagar Singh was on the field for the purpose of watching it against the neel gais trespassing and grazing the crop.
It is not therefore a matter of surprise that he wakes up and proceeds to the spot from where the splashing sound which, is supposed to be due to the wading of the neel gais, came.
On reaching the Canal bank, he observes 209 the person bathing and naturally asks him what.
led him to have a bath at that hour at night.
Taken by surprise, it is not unlikely that the appellant should have made a statement that he had committed the murder of Sheo Sahai and was, thereafter, having a bath.
There is no reason to think that the appellant would not make such a statement when the appellant himself proceeds to the Police Station and hands over the blood stained sword.
It is no doubt unusual, as urged for the appellant, that a person who commits a murder in pursuance of an enmity arising out of minor disputes, would be feeling so justified in his conduct as to openly admit it to the first person he met and to go to the Police Station and report about it.
It is always difficult to find reasons for a person 's acting in a certain manner.
It may be that having blurted out the truth to Ujagar Singh, when taken by surprise, the appellant thought the best thing to be to proceed to the Police Station and report the matter there.
It is true that Ujagar Singh did not rush to the village at once and convey the news of the murder of Sheo Sahai.
The learned Sessions Judge has considered the criticism against such a conduct and has held that there were good reasons for Ujagar Singh 's not leaving his field whose crops he was watching against the neel gais.
We agree with the view of the learned Sessions Judge and do not consider Ujagar Singh 's conduct of continuing to remain on his field during the night to be so improbable as to affect his veracity.
Ujagar Singh went to the village at about 5 a.m., and them told the people of what he had been told by the appellant.
This statement of his, is supported impliedly by Paley Singh, P.W. 2, who states that the Sub Inspector was not present when Ujagar Singh related to them the fact which had taken place at night and by Bishram Singh, P.W. 13, who 210 deposed that Ujagar Singh stated that Ram Singh was taking his bath at night in the Canal Distributory and had said that he had come after committing the murder of Sheo Sahai and that the appellant had then proceeded towards the police station.
We are therefore of opinion that Ujagar Singh 's statement about the appellant 's confessing to him that he had murdered Sheo Sahai has been erroneously rejected by the High Court.
The extra judicial confession of the appellant to Ujagar Singh finds ample support from the facts that the appellant did purchase a sword a day before, that very sword was found to be stained with human blood shortly after the murder and that sword was handed over by the appellant himself to the Police Officer at the Police Station.
The evidence of the appellant 's having enmity with Sheo Sahai, the appellant 's conduct in purchasing a sword and delivering it stained with human blood to the Police and the appellant 's confession to Ujagar Singh, fully establish that the appellant did commit the murder of Sheo Sahai.
We are therefore of opinion that he has been rightly convicted of the offence under section 302, I.P.C., and has been awarded the proper sentence.
We therefore dismiss the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
","The appellant was tried for murder.
The facts established were that there were quarrels between the appellant and the deceased over the purchase of a cycle and in a play of cards that the appellant had purchased a sword a day earlier and that he had deposited the sword stained with human blood at the police station shortly after the murder.
Evidence was also led of an extra judicial confession made by the appellant to one U but the High Court did not place reliance on it as it did not feel sure of it though it observed that a perusal of the statement of U showed that it was very likely that what he stated may have happened.
^ Held, that the statement of U regarding the extra judicial confession was erroneously rejected by the High Court.
Extra judicial confessions were not usually considered with favour but such a confession coming from a person who had no reason to state falsely and to whom it was made in circumstances which tended to support his statement could be relied upon.
The extra judicial confession in the present case was supported by the facts established, and these together fully established the guilt of the appellant.

D. Mookherjee and Harbans Singh and V.M. Jain, for the appellants.
Deven Chetan Das, Advocate General, Haryana and R.N. Sachthey, for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court as delivered by RAY, C.J. These are appeals under section 19(1)(b) of the against the judgment and order dated 1 December, 1975 of the Full Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.
243 The appellants wrote a letter on 20 February 1975 to the President with copies to the Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India, the Chief Minister of Haryana and the Chief Jus tice of Punjab and Haryana High Court.
The letter was signed by 15 members of the Bar belonging to the District Bar Association, Bhiwani.
In that letter they brought to the notice of the President that Justice D.S. Tewatia of the Punjab and Haryana High Court visited the session division of Bhiwani and inspected the Courts from 14 February 1975 to 19 February 1975.
In that letter they further stated as follows: ""The learned Judge met the members of the Bar on 15 February, 1975 in the Bar Room, Bhiwani.
During the course of the meeting, the learned Judge criticised the Government 's policy in regard to its attitude towards the judiciary.
Besides the learned Judge was openly attacking the Govern ment in its political as well as administrative decision.
On the ' whole, he gave an impression that he was not a Judge but a politician who had come to Bar Room.
When the members of the Bar who had gone to meet the learned Judge in the P.W.D. Rest House, Bhiwani he discussed politics with them and criticised the present executive in general and the Congress Party in particular.
He suggested the members of the Bar to revolt against the present Government as it has suppressed the civil liberation (sic) of the individuals and has also failed miserably in all fields.
The Judge further said that the prevailing system of Government is not good in this country and we must adopt the communist form of Govern ment which can save the nation.
Later on he had some pri vate political discussion with the local C.P.M. leaders.
He also accepted the hospitality of the Technological Institute of Textiles (Mills) people who also took him for a sight seeing from Dadri to Pilani.
The members of the District Bar Association highly regret the attitude of Justice D.S. Tewatia and urge the Government to take appropriate action in this regard"".
Five members of the Bar Association at Charkhi Dadri sent a letter addressed to the President.
with copies to the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court, the Chief Minister of Haryana, the Chief Justice of India and the Prime Minister.
In that letter they said that Justice D.S. Tewatia visited the Bar and inspected the court at Charkhi Dadri on 17 February, 1975.
Thereafter they stated as follows: ""While talking with the members of the Bar, he pointed out that the library of this Bar seems to be very poor.
Then Shri Virender Kumar Single, a member of the Bar requested the honourable Judge to help the Bar either by supplying books or by allocating the grant by the High Court so that the needy Bar may be able to purchase necessary books for the library.
Then the Honourable Judge turned down the request and replied that it is never possible in the present system of Government of India.
If you want this kind of help then you should prepare yourself for the commu nist Government in India by creating such atmosphere in the country.
At another stage also during the course of his discussion with the members of the Bar over the matter of Rajasthan Law students demands in which they demanded a grant 244 of Rs. 5000/ from the Government for the library of each fresh law graduate and Rs. 200/ per month for a period of two years the initial stage of their legal practice he strongly emphasised the need for the communist system of Society and Government in India to fulfil these demands.
The learned Judge also met Smt.
Chandrawati separately and discussed with her the political affairs of the State.
He also expressed his desire to see Comrade Dharam Singh a member of the Marxist Communist Party at his residence before Smt.
Chandrawati.
During his stay in the rest house he also discussed the teachers agitation and individual position of various political leaders in the State.
He also enquired all about Shri Sohan Lal a leader of the teacher 's movement in the State"".
The letter concluded by saying that the Hon 'ble Judge during his entire stay in his tour deliberately showed the bent of his mind towards commu nism while exchanging view on various matters.
The appellants took a copy of their letter to the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana.
The appellants could not see the Chief Justice and left the letter with the Registrar in a closed cover.
The Registrar told them that the closed cover could reach the Hon 'ble Chief Justice, A notice was issued by the High Court on 12 March 1975 as follows: ""Letter dated 20th February, 1975 a copy of an application dated 20 February, 1975 signed by 15 members of the District Bar Association, Bhiwani, has been placed for the consideration of this Bench.
On a perusal of the con tents thereof, a prima facie case of criminal contempt is made out.
We therefore direct that the contempt of Court (Punjab 'and Haryana) Rules, 1974 be issued to each of the signatories of the above said application, returnable for the 1st of April, 1975"".
The High Court did not take any action against two persons on the letter written by five members of the Bar Association of Charkhi Dadri.
Each of the appellants affirmed an affidavit in this pattern.
""It is an article of faith with the deponent that dignity and respect of all Courts and of all Judges and particularly of the High Court must be maintained for, amongst other reasons, on that depends the orderly function ing of the society as also prestige of the profession to which the deponent has the honour to belong.
The deponent has been taught to believe that a Judge ought always to steer clear of all avoidable controversial matters.
The deponent most respectfully submits that the contents of the letter which he and others addressed to the President of India cannot be construed as scandalising the Hon 'ble Judge or the Court in any manner to weaken people 's faith in the administration of justice.
The letter in question was addressed by the deponent to the President of India with copies to others with the sole object of conveying the opinion that the public expression by the Hon 'ble Judge of his personal views on controversial political matters con cerning the merits and demerits of the present system of the Government was not in keeping with the well accepted role of proverbial aloofness of a Judge.
The letter was addressed ,bona fide, in good faith and without 245 any ill will and no publicity was given to it.
It was intended to be a privileged communication made solely with a view to uphold the dignity of the Court.
In order to prevent unwanted disclosure of its contents, the communica tion in question was brought personally by two members of the Bar Association, Bhiwani to Chandigarh in a closed cover addressed to the Chief Justice for being handed over to him for his personal attention.
The deponent submits that the contents of the letter.
have no relevance or relation to the functioning of the learned Judge of the High Court.
The letter does not interfere much less substantial ly with due course of justice or proper administration of law by the courts.
The deponent submits that there was no intention whatsoever on his part to scandalise the Hon 'ble Judge or this Hon 'ble Court or to lower the authority or undermine the prestige of the learned Judge or of the Hon ' ble Court or to weaken in any way the confidence of the people in the administration of justice.
The deponent respectfully submits that the communication does not bear out any foundation for an action for criminal contempt.
In any case, if in view of this Hon 'ble Court, the action of the deponent in addressing the letter in question constitut ed for any reason contempt of court, one would be more sorry than the deponent himself.
Therefore, the deponent tenders his apology to this Hon 'ble Court, for the same, and prays for its acceptance.
"" The Full Bench of the High Court consisting of Justice Surjit Singh Sandhawalia, Justice Prem Chand Jain and Jus tice Bhupinder Singh Dhillon extracted portions from the affidavit of the appellants to which references has been made.
The Full Bench thereafter referred to paragraph 9 of the affidavit where the deponents said that ""if in view of this Hon 'ble Court the action of the deponent in addressing the letter in question constituted for any reason contempt of court, no one would be more sorry than the deponent himself.
Therefore, the deponent tender his apology to this Hon 'ble Court for the same and prays for its acceptance"".
After the recital of paragraph 9 the judgment of the Full Bench said as follows: ""In view of the averments made in the affidavit filed in rely and in particular in paragraph 9 thereof we accept the apology tendered on behalf of the respondents and discharge the rule issued against them"".
In our view the judgment is utterly unsound and unsus tainable.
The elementary basis of acceptance of apology is that there is to be a finding of committal of contempt.
The deponents stated that if the Court is of the view that the letter of the deponents constitute for any reason contempt of court, the deponents tender apology.
It is a conditional apology.
The condition is that if there is contempt the deponents tender apology.
In the absence of any finding by the High Court that the appellants committed any contempt of court there was never any occasion for acceptance of apology.
It appears before us that the allegations in the letter were not disputed and challenged.
The High Court proceeded on the basis that the letters written by the appellants were correct.
It is indeed curious 246 that the High Court in the notice referred to the letter of the appellant and said ""on a perusal of the contents thereof a prima facie case contempt is made out"".
The High Court did not mention which particular portion of the letter constituted contempt of court.
It is necessary to state here that if any Judge address es on political problems or controversies the Judge exposes himself to discussion by public.
The reason is that the Judge travels from his judicial work and descends into the arena of politics and parties.
The Judge cannot in such a case take shelter behind his office if the public discusses and criticises the views expressed by him.
The reason is obvious.
It is no part of the duty of a Judge nor is it a duty in discharge of office of a Judge to go and address a meeting on political matters to redress grievances of the people.
However, if the speech of any Judge is criticised and if it becomes a disputed question of fact as to whether any Judge did speak or not as is alleged by the writer the matter would have to be ascertained by the court on facts whether the Judge concerned did speak on the matters ascribed to him before the court would take any action against the persons who would criticise the Judge 's speech.
We wish to make it clear that if on facts it appears that the Judge did say things or matters about politics such utterances or views or observations will be the personal opinions expressed by the Judge, and, therefore, the protec tive umbrella of the court cannot be used by way of bringing the critics on the charge of contempt of court.
It also appears in the letter that there is an allega tion that the Judge accepted hospitality of some organisa tion.
To say that will not by itself be a contempt.
All we need say is that it will not be correct and proper for any Judge to accept the invitation and hospitality of any busi ness or commercial organisation or of any political party or of any club or organisation run on sectarian, communal or parochial lines.
Invitations by the Bar Associ ation or social invitations naturally Stand on a different footing and no one will find an exception to any Judge attending a social function.
Judges are by reason of their office and nature of work expected not to get involved in controversial matters, or to concern themselves with political issues or policies under taken by political parties as a part of their political programme.
We are of opinion that the Full Bench fell into the error of accepting the apology without finding that the appellants committed any contempt.
In the absence of such a finding no question arises for acceptance of apology.
In view of the fact that the High Court proceeded on the basis that the allegations in the letter were unchallenged we are of opinion that the matters did not constitute any contempt.
The High.
Court should have dropped the proceed ings and not pursued the matter.
247 The judgment is set aside.
The contempt proceedings are dropped.
We should state here that the Advocate General of Haryana quite fairly stated that the letter did not consti tute any contempt.
M.R. Appeals allowed.
","The appellants wrote a letter to the President of India, with copies to some others including the Chief Jus tice of Punjab and Haryana High Court, criticising, the behaviour of a High Court Judge, who, during his visit to the Sessions Division of Bhivani, spoke against the Govern ment 's policies and canvassed for a communist system.
The High Court issued a notice against the appellants; making out a case of criminal contempt of court.
The appellants tendered a conditional apology contingent on the courts finding their action to be contempt of court.
The apology was accepted.
Allowing the appeals and dropping the contempt proceedings, the Court.
HELD: (1) The elementary basis of acceptance of apology is that there is to be a finding of committal of contempt.
The Full Bench fell into the error of accepting the apology without finding that the appellants committed any contempt In the absence of such a finding, no question arises for acceptance of apology.
F G] (2) Judges are, by reason of their office and nature of work, expected not to get involved in controversial matters, or to concern themselves with political issues or policies undertaken by political parties.
If any Judge addresses on political problems or controversies, the Judge exposes himself to discussion by public.

6118,"(Civil) No. 548 of 1987.
(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).
M.C. Dhingra for the Petitioners.
Kapil Sibal, K.G. Bhagat, A.K. Ganguli, Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, 664 Ms. Aruna Mathur, A. Mariarputham, Harminder Lal and Naresh K. Sharma for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K. JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J.
The petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation (the ""Corpo ration"").
They are termed as daily rated employees.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have ""equal pay for equal work"".
They demand payment in terms paid to their counterparts in regular services.
They want the same pay of the regular employees as carpenters or in the alternative, the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commissioner for like categories of workmen.
They also seek regularisation of their services with the benefits of pen sion, gratuity etc.
The Corporation has resisted the petitioners ' claim.
The case of the Corporation is that the unit where the petition ers are working is a factory registered under the Factories Act.
The petitioners are treated as industrial workmen and .are given all benefits due to them under the various labour legislations.
The Government has not fixed the mini mum wages payable to the petitioners engaged in the Corpora tion or other like industries, but the Corporation has adopted the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construction industry.
They are being paid the same wages as are payable to carpenters, painters and carpenters ' helpers engaged in the construction industry.
They are given bonus under the Bonus Act and provident fund benefits under the Employees ' Provident Fund Act.
It is also stated that the petitioners are supplied with the necessary tools for carry ing out their work and also working uniforms like aprons and overalls.
The Corporation has clearly stated that there are no regular employees of the petitioners ' categories in its establishment and, as such, the question of payment to the petitioners, the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.
A little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.
The Corporation is a company which has been incorporated under the .
The main object of the Corporation as seen from the Memorandum of Associa tion is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and also to popularise handicrafts and handloom items 665 in the State of Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the country and abroad.
In order to achieve this primary objec tive, the Corporation gives training to artisans, weavers and craftsmen in various traditional arts and crafts.
During the period of training, the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.
Upto 31st March, 1987, the Corporation has imparted training to as many as 1662 persons in different areas like carpet weaving, handloom weaving, painting, metal crafts, wood carving, etc.
Apart from giving training, the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
It is said that the village artisans and craftsmen make different items on a piece rate basis and in some cases, they execute the work in their own homes.
The financial aspect of the Corporation is stated to be not encouraging, and indeed, it is disappointing.
It has suffered huge loss and the total losses accumulated hitherto is Rs.69.77 lakhs.
Nonetheless, for the purpose of preserv ing and promoting traditional arts and crafts, the Corpora tion has been kept alive.
But to avoid or minimise further loss, it is stated that the Corporation has reduced its overheads and maintained only the administrative staff in the production centers at different parts of the State and no permanent craftsmen are employed.
With these facts, we may now turn to the principle upon which the petitioners ' case is rested.
The principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" is not one of the fundamental rights expressly guaranteed by our Constitution.
The princi ple was incorporated only under Article 39(d) of the Consti tution as a Directive Principle of State Policy.
Perhaps, for the first time, this Court in Randhir Singh vs Union of India, ; has innovated that it is a constitu tional goal capable of being achieved through constitutional remedies.
There the Court pointed out that that principle has to be read into Article 14 of the Constitution which enjoins the State not to deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law and also to Article 16 which declares that there should be equality of opportu nity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.
Randhir Singh case was concerned with a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force under the Delhi Administration.
He claimed equal salary for equal work at that of other drivers.
The Court found that the petitioner therein performed the same func 666 tions and duties as other drivers in the service of Delhi Administration.
The Court, therefore, directed the Central Government to fix the pay scale of the petitioner on par with his counterparts doing identical work under the same employer.
In the immediate aftermath of the decision in Randhir Singh case, there were bumper cases filed in this Court for enforcement of the right to ""equal pay for equal work"", perhaps little realising the in built restrictions in that principle.
It may not be necessary here to refer to all those decisions since almost all of them have been consid ered and explained in the recent two decisions to which one of us was a party (K. Jagannatha Shetty, J.).
Reference may be made to: (i) State of U.P. vs J.P. Chaurasia, ; and (ii) Meva Ram Kanojia vs All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Anr., ; In Chaurasia case the question arose whether it was permissible to have two different pay scales in the same cadre of Bench Secre taries of the Allahabad High Court who were for all practi cal purposes performing similar duties and having same responsibilities.
The Court held that the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" has no mechanical application in every case of similar work.
Article 14 permits reasonable classification rounded on rational basis.
It is, therefore, not impermissible to provide two different pay scales in the same cadre on the basis of selection based on merit with due regard to experience and seniority.
It was pointed out that in service, merit or experience could be the proper basis for classification to promote efficiency in administration and he or she learns also by experience as much as by other means.
Apart from that, the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
Meva Ram Kanojia is the most recent decision which has exhaustively dealt with all the principles bearing on the question of equal pay for equal work in the light of all the previous decisions of this Court.
There the petitioner was a ""Hearing Therapist"" in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
He claimed pay scale admissible to ""Senior Speech Pathologist"", ""Senior Physiotherapist"", ""Senior Occupational Therapist"", ""Audiologist"", and ""Speech Pathologist"".
His case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as ""Senior Speech Therapist"", ""Senior Physiotherapist"", ""Senior Occupa tional Therapist"", ""Audiologist"" and ""Speech Pathologist"".
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
It was also held 667 that it is open to the State to classify employees on the basis of qualifications, duties and responsibilities of the posts concerned.
If the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved, efficiency in the administration, the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.
Reference may also be made to the decision in Federation of All India Customs and Central Excise Stenographers (Recognised) vs Union of India, ; There the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to the Heads of Department in Customs and Central Excise Department of the Ministry of Finance made a claim for parity of wages with the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to Joint Secretaries and Officers above them in Ministry of Finance.
The Court while rejecting the claim expressed the view (at 100): ""But equal pay must depend upon the nature of the work done, it cannot be judged by the mere volume of work, there may be qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility.
Functions may be the same but the responsibilities make a difference.
One cannot deny that often the difference is a matter of degree and that there is an element of value judgment by those who are charged with the administration in fixing the scales of pay and other conditions of service.
So long as such value judgment is made bona fide, reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of dif ferentiation, such differentiation will not amount to discrimination.
It is important to emphasize that equal pay for equal work is a concomitant of Article 14 of the Constitution.
But it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right."" Thus the law relating to equal pay for equal work has been practically hammered out and very little remains for further innovation.
In the light of the aforesaid principles, we may now consider whether the equality claims of the petitioners could be allowed.
We have carefully perused the material on record and gave our anxious consideration to the question urged.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
Evidently the petitioners are claiming wages payable to the carpenters in Government service.
We do not think that 668 we could accept their claim.
In the first place, even assum ing that the petitioners ' jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service, the petitioners cannot enforce the right to ""equal pay for equal work"".
The discrimination complained of must be within the same estab lishment owned by the same management.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management, or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.
Unless it is shown that there is a discrimination amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment, the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" cannot be enforced.
This was also the view expressed in Meva Ram Kanojia vs A.I.I.M.S., ; at 245.
In the instant case, the petitioners are employed by a company incorporated under the .
They cannot claim wages payable to their counterparts in government service.
Secondly, it may be noted that the petitioners are carpenters; better called as craftsmen.
By the general description of their job, one cannot come to the conclusion that every carpenter or craftsmen is equal to the other in the performance of his work.
The two jobs by the mere nomen clature or by the volume of work performed cannot be rated as equal.
It is not just a comparison of physical activity.
It requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.
The accuracy required by the job and the dexterity it entails may differ from job to job.
It cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties.
It must be left to be evaluated and determined by expert body.
The principal claim of the petitioners therefore fails and is rejected.
The next contention that the petitioners should be paid at least the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commis sioner under Exhibit P. 2 dated March 20, 1986 cannot also be accepted.
exhibit P. 2 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner in the exercise of his powers under the H.P. Financial Rules.
It is applicable only to skilled and unskilled work ers in class IV employees in Government service.
It has not been extended to employees of the Corporation.
The petition ers have been treated as construction workers and they are being paid the minimum wages admissible to such workmen.
The Court, therefore, cannot direct the Corporation to apply the rates prescribed under exhibit P. 2 unless the Government makes it applicable to employees of the Corporation.
As to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners, 669 we express no opinion, since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.
We leave the petitioners to work out their rights elsewhere in accordance with law applicable to them.
In the result, the petition fails and is dismissed.
In the circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs.
P.S.S. Petition dismissed.
","The petitioners employed as daily rated carpenters at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handi crafts Corporation sought enforcement of their fundamental right to have ""equal pay for equal work"" in terms paid to their counterparts in regular services, or in the alterna tive, the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commission er for like categories of workmen.
The petitioners ' claim was resisted by the respondents.
Their case was that the unit where the petitioners were working was a factory registered under the Factories Act, that they were treated as industrial workmen and given all benefits due to them under the various labour legislations, that the Government had not fixed the minimum wages payable to the workmen engaged in the Corporation or other like industries but the Corporation had adopted for its workmen the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construc tion industry, and that there were no regular employees of the petitioners ' categories in its establishment and, as such, the question of payment to them the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.
Dismissing the writ petition, HELD: 1.
Unless it is shown that there is a discrimina tion amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment, the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" cannot be enforced.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management, or even in establishments in different geograph ical location though owned by the same master.
[668B] In the instant case, the petitioners were employed by a company incorporated under the Companies Act.
They cannot claim wages pay 663 able to their counterparts in government service.
[668C] Meva Ram Kanojia vs All India Institute of Medical Sciences & Anr., ; , referred to.
Randhir Singh vs Union of India, ; , ex plained.
The principle of 'equal pay for equal work ' has no mechanical application in every case of similar work.
No two jobs by the mere nomenclature or by the volume of work performed can be rated as equal.
It is not just a comparison of physical activity.
It requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.
The accuracy required by the job and the dexterity it entails may differ from job to job.
It cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties.
It must be left to be evaluated and determined by expert body.
[666D, 668D E] In the instant case, however, the Corporation had no regularly employed carpenters.
Even assuming that the peti tioners ' jobs were comparable with the counterparts in Government service they could not enforce the right to equal pay for equal work.

4860,"N: Criminal Appeal Nos.
287 & 288 of 1980 Appeals by Special leave from the judgment and Order dated the 27th July & 8th August, 1979 of the Bombay High Court in Crl.

O.P. Rana, K. V. Sree Kumar and M.N, Shroff, for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VARADARAJAN, J.
These appeals of Vinayak and Prakash, accused 6 and 5 respectively in Sessions Case 26 of 1976 on the file of the Sessions Judge, Prabhani by special leave, are directed against the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeals 7 of 1977 and 605 of 1978.
Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 was filed by Sitaram @ Sitya and Vinayak, accused 1 and 6 respectively, against their conviction under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. in respect of the murder of one Malan, daughter of Kishan and the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to them.
Criminal Appeal 605 of 1978 was filed by the State of Maharashtra against the acquittal of Sundar @ Sundarayya, Kishan @ Kishanayya, Gangaram @ Gangayya, Prakash and Shrirang, accused 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 respectively of the charge under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. in respect of the murder of Malan and against their acquittal of the charge framed under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C.
The State of Maharashtra filed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 by the trial court.
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we allowed the appeal of Prakash, accused 5 and acquitted him and set aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him.
So far as Vinayak, accused 6 is concerned, we dismissed his appeal on 13.9.1984 for reason to follow.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
Sessions Case 26 of 1977 is stated to be an off shoot of what is known as the 'Manwath murders case ' in which Prakash 's father Uttamrao Barhate and his permanently kept concubine Rukmanibai and 13 others were tried for the murders of 10 girls and women during the period from 14.11.1972 to 4 11.1974 in Manwath village, Prabhani district, Maharashtra State.
In the case the above seven accused were tried for three murders of two young girls and a women alleged to have been committed them and the approver Sheshrao (P.W. 1) during the period from 782 10.11.1975 to 1.1.1976 in Babultara village, Prabhani district.
Charge No. 1 framed in this case was for criminal conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. on the allegation that between the first week of October 1975 and 2.1.1976 at Babultara and Waghala villages, all the seven accused and the approver P.W. 1.
entered into a criminal conspiracy to commit murders of young girls and women in the vicinity of Babultara village by inflicting injuries on the private parts of the victims or disfiguring their faces in order to make it appear that the accused in the Manwath murders case are not the real culprits and that in pursuance of that conspiracy these seven accused and the approver P.W. 1 committed three murders of Ashamati, aged 9 years, Parubai, aged 40 years and Malan, aged 12 years in Babultara village.
Charge No. 2 framed against accused 1 to 3 was under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C.
On the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Ashamati on or about 10.11.1975.
Charge No. 3 framed against accused 1 to 4 was under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. on the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Parubai on or about 29.11.1975.
The last charge No. 4 framed against accused 1, 6 and 7 was under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. on the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Malan on or about 1.1.1976.
The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against them.
The Sessions Judge found, on a consideration of the evidence, all the seven accused not guilty of the charge of conspiracy framed under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and acquitted them.
He found accused 1 to 3 not guilty of charge No. 2 framed against them in respect of the murder of Ashamati and accused 1 to 4 not guilty of charge No, 3 framed against them in respect of the murder of Parubai and acquitted them.
He found accused No. 7 not guilty but accused 1 and 6 guilty of charge No. 4 framed against them in respect of the murder of Malan and acquitted accused 7 and convicted accused 1 and 6 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C.
The State did not file any appeal against the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 of charge No. 1 framed against them under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C.
As state earlier, Criminal Appeal 38 of 783 of 1977 was filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 in respect of the murder of Malan and Criminal Appeal 605 of 1978 against the acquittal of accused 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of charge No. 1 framed under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. Thus the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 of charge No. 1 framed against them under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and of accused 1 to 3 of charge No. 2 in respect of the murder of Ashamati and of accused 1 to 4 of charge No. 3 in respect of the murder of Parubai became final.
The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
The first accused Sitaram @ Sitya has not filed any appeal in this Court against the High Court 's judgment confirming his conviction and sentence awarded to him by the trial court under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. for the murder of Malan.
Therefore, his conviction and sentence awarded to him have become final.
Accused 5 and 6 only have filed Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 respectively against the conviction of accused 5 and the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded by the High Court under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and the confirmation of the conviction and sentence awarded to accused 6 by the trial court under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. respectively.
In view of the acquittal of all the seven accused by the trial court of charge No. 1 framed under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and the High Court 's dismissal of Criminal Appeal No. 605 of 1978 filed against that acquittal which, as stated earlier, was filed only against accused 2,3,4 and 7 not against accused 1 and 6, in so far as it related to accused 2, 3, 4 and 7, Mr. V. section Desai, learned senior counsel appearing for Prakash, accused 5, contended in his arguments that the conviction of that accused alone for conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. is unsustainable in law as at least two persons are required for an offence of conspiracy under section 120A I.P.C. and he relied upon a decision of this Court in Topandas vs State of Bombay(1) in support of his contention.
In 784 that case the charge under section 120B I.P.C. was framed against four named persons who had been arrayed as accused 1 to 4.
The High Court acquitted accused 2 to 4 and convicted accused 1 alone of that charge and sentenced him, holding that he and some others had conspired together and fabricated the deed of assignment put forward by accused 1 and that accused 1 alone could not have fabricated that document.
This Court allowed the appeal of accused 1 and set aside his conviction under 120B I.P.C. holding that the conviction of one of the accused alone was unsustainable in law having regard to the requirement of s.120A I.P.C. Mr. O.P. Rana learned senior counsel appearing for the state of Maharashtra sought to support the judgment of the High Court in this case against accused 5 in view of the conviction of accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan under s, 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. We repelled that submission of Mr. Rana, in view of the fact that those two accused 1 and 6 had been acquitted by the trial court of charge No. 1 farmed against them under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and no appeal against their acquittal had been filed in the High Court and also the fact that accused 5 was not a party to charge No.4 which was framed only against accused 1, 6 and 7.
It was in view of this technical flaw that we allowed the appeal of accused 5 without going into the evidence regarding the merits of the case against him.
Mr. Rana did not draw our attention in the course of his arguments to the fact that in charge No. 1 even the approver P.W. 1 is alleged to have conspired with the seven accused to commit these three murders or contend that in view of that circumstance and the finding of the High Court that the approver P.W. 1 also was a party to the conspiracy the conviction of accused 5 alone of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. could be sustained.
We were, therefore, not called upon to consider any such question.
As regards accused 6 in the High Court reliance was placed by the prosecution on four pieces of evidence besides the evidence of the approver P.W. 1 and the retracted confession of accused 5.
Those four pieces of evidence are: (1) recovery of the razor blade, article 54, persuant to the confessional statement of accused 6, admitted under section 27, Evidence Act.
The blade was found by the Serologist to be stained with human blood of group B like that of Malan; (2) recovery of the blood stained shirt, article 55, of accused 6 from his house; (3) evidence regarding the presence of accused 785 6 along with accused 7 and P,W. 1 near about the scene of offence before and after the commission of the murder of Malan.
It is the case of the prosecution that Shivram, P.W. 45 saw accused 6 under a vad tree and Abasaheb, P.W. 44, saw him in the rivulet; and (4) retracted judicial confession, Exh. 138 of accused 6.
The High Court found on the evidence of Munjebi, P.W. 50 and Hanumant Salunke, Sub Inspector of Police P.W. 53, that the blood stained shirt, article 54 was recovered from the house of accused 6.
But the Serologist was unable to determine the origin of the blood found on article 55 due to its disintegration.
Therefore, the High Court did not place any reliance on this circumstance, namely, recovery of the blood stained shirt, article 55 from the house of accused 6.
The High Court found that the evidence of P.W. 44 and 45 does not establish beyond reasonable doubt that accused 6 was found in the company of accused 7 and the approver P.W. 1 near about the place of occurrence as alleged by the prosecution before and after the murder of Malan.
But the High Court accepted the evidence of the approver P.W. 1 against accused 6 as reliable and the judicial confession, Exh. 138 of accused 6 as being voluntary and reliable and (both) corroborated by other evidence and it acted also upon the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 in holding that the guilt of accused 6 for the murder of Malan had been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1, 6 and 7 were tried.
The evidence of the approver P.W. 1 and the retracted confession of accused 5, Exh. 138 are amply corroborated by other evidence, namely, recovery of the blood stained razor, article 54 and the medical evidence of Dr. Suresh (P.W. 31) who had conducted autopsy on the body of Malan at 4.15 p.m. on 2.1.1976.
The Doctor found 9 incised wounds on various parts of the body of Malan besides a small incised injury on the right wall of the vagina outside in the middle and a small incised injury on the lower end of the vagina just at the mouth and he is of the opinion that all the 11 injuries were antemortem injuries which might have been caused by sharp cutting weapons, that it is possible that injuries 5 to 7 found on the forehead and right and left side of the parietal eminance were 786 caused by hard and blunt objects, that death must have been instantaneous and that injuries 1 to 7 collectively were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
In these circumstances we found that there is sufficient evidence against accused 6 proving his guilt in respect of charge No. 4 framed regarding the murder of Malan beyond all reasonable doubt and that he had been rightly convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 34 I. P. C. Accordingly, we allowed the Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and acquitted Prakash, accused 5 and directed him to be set at liberty forthwith and dismissed Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 filed by accused 6 and confirmed the conviction of accused 6 and the sentence awarded to him by the courts below.
","In Sessions Case No. 26 of 1976, seven accused namely Sitarama @ Sitya, Sundera @ Sundarayya, Kishana @ Kishanayya, Gangarama @ Gangayya, Prakash, Vinayak and Shrirang were charged and tried together for offences under section 302 read with section 120B and also under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. Charge No. 1 was for criminal conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. on the allegation that between first week of October, 1975 and 2nd January, 1976 at Babultara and Waghala villages all the seven accused and the approver P.W. 1 entered into a criminal conspiracy to commit murders of young girls and women in the vicinity of Babultara village by injuring the victims or disfiguring their faces in order to make it appear that the accused in an earlier case called the Manwath murders case where 10 girls and women were murdered during the period from 14.11.1972 to 4.11.1974 in Manwath village were not the real culprits.
Charges 2 to 4 were framed under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. alleging that in furtherance of their common intention, accused 1 to 3 committed the murder of Ashamati on or about 10th November, 1975, accused 1 to 4 committed the murder of Parubai on or about 29th November, 1975 and accused 1, 6 and 7 committed the murder of Malan on or about 1st January, 1976.
The Sessions Judge on a consideration of the evidence acquitted all the seven accused under charge No. 1; all the accused under charges 2 and 3 and accused 7 under charge No. 4, but convicted accused 1 and 6 under charge No. 4 and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence accused 1 and 6 filed Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 1977 in the High Court of Bombay, while the State preferred Criminal Appeal No. 38 of 1977 for enhancement of the sentence awarded to them under section 377 Cr.
The State also preferred under section 378 Cr.
P.C. Criminal Appeal No. 605 of 1978 against the acquittal of accused 2, 34, 5 and 7 of charge No. 1 framed under section 302 read with section 120B.
There 780 being no further appeal by the State against acquittal; the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 of charge No. 1 and of accused 1 to 3 of charge No. 2 and of accused 1 to 4 of charge No. 3 became final.
The High Court considered the evidence, in the case, and dismissed Criminal Appeals Nos. 7 of 1977 and the connected Criminal State Appeal No. 38 of 1977 and thereby confirmed the conviction and the sentence awarded to accused Nos. 1 and 6.
The High Court, however accepted the State Appeal No. 605 of 1978 in part and convicted accused 5 and sentenced him to imprisonment for life under section 302 I.P.C. read with section 120B.
Hence the present appeals by accused 5 and 6 only, accused No. 1 not preferring an appeal.
Allowing the appeal No. 288 of 1980 of accused No. 5 and dismissing appeal No. 287 of 1980, the Court.
^ HELD: 1.
In view of the fact (a) that accused 1 and 6 had been acquitted by the trial court of charge No. 1, that is, criminal conspiracy under section 120B read with section 302 I.P.C. (b) that no State Appeal against their acquittal had been preferred and (c) that accused 5 was not a party to charge No. 4 which was framed against accused nos.
1, 6 and 7 the conviction and sentence of accused No. 5 by the High Court is unsustainable in law.
[783FG] Topandas vs State of Bombay referred to. 2.
The retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and accused 5 was not a party for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused nos.

5142,"N: Criminal Appeal No. 317 of 1986 From the Judgment and order dated 27.2.1986 of the Patna High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 33 of 1986.
With W.P. (Criminal)No. 316 of 1986.
R.K. Garg and Miss Rani Jethmalani for the Appellant/ Petitioner. D. Goburdhan for the Respondents.
907 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.
Criminal Appeal No. 317 of 1986 arises out of the judgment and order of the High Court of Patna and the Writ Petition No. 316 is in respect of the same detenu.
Both these challenge the order of detention dated 2nd January, 1986 passed by the respondent no.1.
The District Magistrate Dhanbad in respect of the petitioner under section 3(2) of the , hereinafter called the 'Act ' on the ground that the petitioner 's activities were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
Several criminal cases had been filed against the petitioner between 3rd January, 1983 to 18th February, 1985.
On or about 2nd January, 1985 the order of detention was passed on an incident relating to the exchange of fire between two rival groups.
The order states the grounds as follows: 1.
On 24.12.1985, between 10 and 10.30.
A.M. the subject alongwith Ramashish Bangali, Gulam, Rambriksha armed with Rifle, gun etc.
came in Car No. BHG 9372 on Katras Coal Dump and started indiscriminate firing to kill Birendra Pratap Singh a rival of his calendestine business of coal to establish his criminal superiority in full view of the shopkeepers customers and passers by of the area.
Birendra Pratap Singh and his associates who were there also returned the firing in same manner.
As a result of this firing one innocent namely Brahamdeo Mishra was killed.
The exchange of indiscriminate firing in the main market area of Katras created great panic and alarm in the area.
The normal tempo of life was completely disturbed.
The people started running helter and skelter for their lives.
Shopkeepers put down their shutters.
Doors and windows were closed.
The vehicular traffic came to halt.
This refers to Katras P.S. Case No. 331/85 dated 24.12.85 u/s 149/307/32 IPC/27 Arms Act.
Besides the aforesaid ground the following cases are also referred hereunder as background to show the criminality of the subject.
KATRAS P.S. CASE No. 5/83 dated 3.1.83 u/s 147, 341/353/307 I.P.C.
In this case subject and his associates tried to set free 908 the trucks and driver from the police custody by force and when he failed in his attempt he threatened the police officer and CISF Personnel to do away with their lives, C.S.No. 5/83 has already been submitted in this case.
Katras P.S. Case No. 303/83 u/s 147/148/452/323 IPC.
In this case subject and his associates went to the tailoring shop of Saukat Ansari and asked him to keep his cloths ready by 9.10.83 and on his refusal, he assaulted him in presence of customers and others C.S.No.
196/83 has already been submitted in this case.
Jogta P.S. Case No. 22/84 dated 11.3.84 u/s 147/148, 307/326/353/333/324/325 I.P.C./27 Arms Act.
In this case subject and his associates opened fire on police party who went to apprehend Raghunath Singh absconder under NSA.
As a result of this indiscriminate firing by him and his associates one Police officer namely Shri R.K. Verma, received serious head injury and is still incapable to work.
Charge sheet No. 25/84 has already been submitted in this case.
Jogta P.S. Case No. 9/85 dated 18.2.85 u/s 369, 307/323/ 324/ 176/34 I.P.C./27 Arms Act.
In this case Sisir Rajan Das, who was coming in a religious procession on the eve of Shivratri and was dancing in the role of Shiva was compelled by his associates to dance before the marriage party of subject 's sister.
Sri Sisir Rajan Das, however, acceded to their request and started dancing.
When he was dancing some of the members opened fire on him as a result of which he fell down.
The subject and his associates however put his body in his car and fled away.
Neither Shri Das nor his body could be traced out till date.
909 Charge sheet No. 20/85 has already been submitted in this case.
(Emphasis supplied) 5.
Jogta P.S. Case No. 68/85 dated 1.12.85 u/s 341/34 IPC.
In this case subject threatened Sri Krishana Ballav Sahay, General Secretary, Colliery Shramik Sangh, Sijua, to do away with his life if he takes out any procession or oppose him.
It is the case of the detenu that the order of detention was made on one incident relating to exchange of fire between two rival groups.
A criminal case had been registered in relation to the said incident pursuant to which the petitioner was already in custody.
The order of detention though dated 2nd January, 1986 was served on or about 11th January, 1986.
It is the case of the appellant/petitioner that the detenu was not served with all the documents referred to and/or relied on.
The detenu was served with order of approval of the said order of detention by the Government of Bihar.
The petitioner/appellant made representation on 22nd January, 1986 and the petitioner/ appellant was informed that the said representation was rejected.
Thereafter the petitioner 's appellant 's matter was referred to the Advisory Board.
The petitioner/appellant states that he desired that he should be heard in person by the Advisory Board.
The petitioner/appellant submits that he was produced before the Advisory Board but he was not given any hearing.
By letter dated 22nd February, 1986 the petitioner/appellant was informed that the Advisory Board had confirmed the order of detention.
The petitioner/ appellant thereafter filed a writ petition in the High Court of Patna which was dismissed without any speaking order.
The grounds of challenge are all stated in the writ petition as well as special leave petition.
The petitioner/ appellant was in detention when the petitioner/appellant was served with the order of detention.
There were criminal cases against the petitioner.
There was a murder case in respect of Crime No. 331 of 1985.
In the said case investigation was in progress and the defence of the petitioner in the murder case was that he was falsely implicated and was not at all concerned with the murder.
When the order was passed, the petitioner had not surrendered but when the order was served, the petitioner had already surrendered in respect of the criminal charge against him.
At the relevant time the petitioner was undertrial in the said criminal case.
910 It is the contention of the petitioner/appellant that the order of preventive detention could only be justified against a person in detention if the detaining authority was satisfied that his release from detention was imminent and the order of detention was necessary for putting him back in jail.
The service of order of detention on the petitioner while he was in jail was futile and useless since such an order had no application under section 3(2) of the Act.
In the affidavit of the District Magistrate, the detaining authority, it has been stated that the activities of the petitioner 's brother and the petitioner have disturbed the normal tempo of life in Katras and Jogta Police Stations in Dhanbad area.
The series of offences against the detenu and the manner of their perpetuation, which have been noted before, indicate a calculated move to create panic and fear in the mind of the people.
It further appears from the affidavit f f the District Magistrate filed before the High Court of Patna that the petitioner was absconding from the very day of the issuance of the detention order.
There is a statement in the order as follows D ""Subject is already in jail.
He is likely to be enlarged on bail.
Hence detention order served in jail.
"" According to the District Magistrate when police pressure to apprehend him became heavy, the detenu opted to surrender before the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate on 10th January, 1986 in substantive case to frustrate the service of the detention order.
It has been further stated that the service of the detention order had been properly made.
Grounds were all indicated.
All the documents which formed the basis of detention were supplied to the detenu.
His representation, was duly considered and rejected.
The grounds stated that there was indiscriminate firing on 24th December, 1985 on Katras Coal Dump and the petitioner started indiscriminate firing to kill Birendra Pratap Singh a rival of his calendestine business of coal to establish the criminal superiority in full view of the shopkeepers, customers and passers by of the area.
The acts alleged created a terror and not only law and order problem but problem of public order.
In those circumstances it appears that the grounds for forming the satisfaction for the need for the detention were there, and there was rational nexus between the object of the order as contemplated by the Act and the materials on record.
The principles applicable in these types of preventive detention cases have been discussed in the decisions of Suraj Pal Sahu vs State of Maharasthra & Ors., W.P. (crl) No. 2 96/86 with SLP (crl) No. 1265/86 dt.
25.9.86 and Raj Kumar Singh vs The State of Bihar & Ors.
Crl A. 353/86 with W.P. (crl) 27/86 dt.
26.9.86.
Judged on the basis of 911 the said principles there is no ground for interference with the order of detention as passed.
It, however, appears that after the order of detention was passed and before the actual service of the order of detention, the petitioner was taken into custody.
From the affidavit of the District Magistrate it does not appear that either the prospect of immediate release of the detenu or other factors which can justify the detention of a person in detention were properly considered in the light of the principles noted in the aforesaid decision and especially in the decisions, in Rameshwar Shaw vs District Magistrate, Burdwan & Anr., ; and Ramesh Yadav vs District Magistrate Etah and others, though there was a statement to the effect that the petitioner was in jail and was likely to be enlarged on bail.
But on what consideration that opinion was expressed is not indicated especially in view of the fact that the detenu was detained in a murder charge in the background of the facts mentioned before.
His application for bail could have been opposed on cogent materials before the Court of Justice.
In this case there were grounds for the passing of the detention order but after that the detenu has surrendered for whatever reasons, therefore the order of detention though justified when it was passed but at the time of the service of the order there was no proper consideration of the fact that the detenu was in custody of that there was any real danger of his release.
Nor does it appear that before the service there was consideration of this aspect properly.
In the facts and circumstances of this case, therefore, the continued detention of the detenu under the Act is not justified.
It is well settled in our Constitutional framework that the power of directing preventive detention given to the appropriate authorities must be exercised in exceptional cases as contemplated by the various provisions of the different statutes dealing with preventive detention and should be used with great deal of circumspection.
There must be awareness of the facts necessitating preventive custody of a person for social defence.
If a man is in custody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released, the power of preventive detention should not be exercised.
In the instant case when the actual order of detention was served upon the detenu, the detenu was in jail.
There is no indication that this factor or the question that the said detenu might be released or that there was such a possibility of his release, was taken into consideration by the detaining authority properly and seriously before the service of the order.
A bald statement is merely an ipso dixit 912 of the officer.
If there were cogent materials for thinking that the detenu might be released then these should have been made apparent.
Eternal vigilance on the part of the authority charged with both law and order and public order is the price which the democracy in this country extracts from the public officials in order to protect the fundamental freedoms of our citizens.
In the affidavits on behalf of the detaining authority though there are indications that transfer of the detenu from one prison to another was considered but the need to serve the detention order while he was in custody was not properly considered by the detaining authority in the light of the relevant factors.
At least the records of the case do not indicate that.
If that is the position, then however disreputable the antecedents of a person might have been without consideration of all the aforesaid relevant factors, the detenu could not have been put into preventive custody.
Therefore, though the order of preventive detention when it was passed was not invalid and on relevant considerations, the service of the order was not on proper consideration.
It may be mentioned that in the petition it is nowhere stated that the detenu has since been released or that the prospect of his imminent release was properly and with seriousness considered by the detaining authority.
The order of detention, therefore, is set aside.
The writ petition and the appeal are allowed to the extent indicated above.
This, how ever, will not affect detenu 's detention under the criminal cases.
If, however, the detenu is released on bail in the aforesaid criminal cases, the matter of service of the detention order under the Act on the aforesaid materials may be reconsidered by the appropriate authority in accordance with the law.
There is no statement in the petition that the detenu is on bail.
There will, therefore, be no orders for release of the detenu.
M.L.A. Petition and Appeal allowed.
","The respondent passed an order of detention in respect of the appellant under section 3(2) of the , on the ground that the appellant 's activities were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
Several criminal cases were pending against the appellant when the aforesaid order was passed.
The appellant had already surrendered in respect of a criminal charge against him before the order was served.
He filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the detention order, but it was dismissed without any speaking order.
Aggrieved by the order of the High Court, the appellant filed the present criminal appeal by special leave as also a writ petition challenging the aforesaid order of detention on the ground that the order of preventive detention could only be justified against a person in detention if the detaining authority was satisfied that his release from detention was imminent and the order of detention was necessary for putting him back in jail.
The service of order of detention on the appellant/ petitioner while he was in jail was futile and useless since such an order had no application under section 3(2) of the Act.
Allowing the writ petition and the appeal in part, ^ HELD: 1.
The continued detention of the detenu under the Act is not justified.
The order of detention therefore is set aside.
However, this will not affect detenu 's detention under the criminal cases.
If however, the detenu is released on bail in the criminal cases already pending against him, the matter of service of the detention order under the Act may be reconsidered by the appropriate authority in accordance with law.

Ramamurthi, J., by order dated April 12, 1968, granted an interim injunction restraining encashment of the letters of credit pending disposal of the suit.
In appeals under the Letters Patent preferred by the second defendant,.
the High Court of Madras set aside that order.
Against the orders passed in the two appeals, the plaintiffs applied for certificate under Arts.133(1)(a) and 133(1)(b) of the Constitution.
The High Court observed that an order granting interim injunction ""is a final order, as far as this Court is concerned, determining the rights of parties within this lit or proceeding, which is independent though ancillary to the suit"", and they were competent to grant the certificate.
By our order dated October 28, 1968, we ordered that the certificate granted by the High Court do stand revoked.
We set out the reasons in support of that order.
Article 133 (1) provides, insofar as it is material: ""(1) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Court certifies (a) that the amount or value of the subject matter of the dispute in the court of first instance and still in dispute on appeal was and is not less than twenty thou sand rupees or such other sum as may be specified in that behalf by Parliament by law; or 701 (b) that the judgment, decree or final order involves directly or indirectly some claim or question respecting property of the like amount or value; or ""(c) . . where the. judgment, decree or final order appealed from affirms the decision of the Court immediately below in any case other than a case referred to in sub clause (c), if the High Court further certifies that the appeal involves some substantial question of law.
"" The suit filed by the plaintiffs is a civil proceeding, and the suit involves some claim or question respecting property of not less than twenty thousand rupees.
That is a matter not in dispute.
The expression ""judgment"" in article 133 ( 1 ) in the context in which it occurs means a final adjudication by the Court of the rights of the parties, 'and that an interlocutory judgment even if it decides an issue or issues without finally determining the rights and liabilities of the parties is not a judgment, however cardinal the issue may be.
In the present case not even an issue has been decided, and it is not contended that the order of the High Court amounts to a judgment or 'a decree.
The expression ""final order"" it has been held by a long course of authorities, occurring in section 205 of the Government of India Act, 1935, section 109 of the Code of Civil Procedure and article 133(1) of the Constitution means a final decision on the rights of the parties in dispute in a suit or proceeding; if the rights of the parties in dispute in the suit or proceeding remain to be tried, after the order, the order is not final.
In Ramchand Manjimal vs Goverdhandas Vishindas RatanChand(1), it was held by the Judicial Committee that an order of the Judicial Commissioner of Sind vacating an order of stay granted under section 19 o,f the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899, and refusing to stay a proceeding was not a final order within the meaning of section 109(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Viscount Cave referred to Salaman vs Warner(2); Bozson Altrincham Urban District Council(a) and Issacs vs Salbstein(4) and observed: ""The effect of those and other judgments is that an order is final if it finally disposes of the rights of the parties.
The orders now under appeal do not finally dispose of those rights, but leave them to be determined by the Courts in the ordinary way.
"" In Abdul Rahman vs
D.K. Cassim & Sons(5) the Judicial Committee observed that the expression ""final order"" within the meaning of section 109(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is an (1) L.R. 47 I.A. 124.
(2) (3) (4) (5) L.R. 60 I.A. 76.
C.I./69 12 702 order which finally disposes of the rights of the parties in relation to the whole suit.
In Abdul Rahman 's case(1) a suit was instituted by D.K. Cassim and Sons claiming damages against the appellant Abdul Rahman.
Soon after the suit was instituted the plaintiff firm was adjudicated insolvent and the official assignee was impleaded as an additional plaintiff.
The official assignee declined to proceed with the suit, and the suit was dismissed by the trial court.
In appeal it was held by the High Court of Calcutta that the cause of action was personal to the insolvents and did not vest in the assignee, and accordingly they set aside the decree and remanded the suit for trial.
Against that order an appeal was preferred to the Judicial Committee which was held not maintainable.
Kuppusami Rao vs The King(2) The Federal Court held that the expression ""final order"" in section 205 (1 ) of the Government of India Act, 1935, means an order which finally determines the points in dispute and brings the case to an end.
The test of finality, according to the court, is whether the order finally disposes of the rights of the parties, and not whether the order decides an important point or even a vital issue in the case.
Mukherjea, J., in interpreting the expression ""judgment, decree or final order"" in section 205 of the Government of India Act, 1935, in Mohammad Amin Brothers Ltd. and others vs Dominion India and others ( 3 ) observed: ""The expression ""final order"" has been used in contradistinction to what is known as ""interlocutory order"" . .
If the decision on an issue puts an end to the suit, the order will undoubtedly be a final one, but if the suit is still left alive and has got to be tried in the ordinary way, no finality could attach to the order."" In Mohammad Amin Brothers ' case(3) an issue was decided by the trial court in a petition for winding up of a Company as to the maintainability of a claim for recovery of income tax dues.
In appeal the High Court overruled the objection raised by the Company about the maintainability of the claim, and finding that a bona fide dispute was pending before the Income tax authorities relating to a substantial part of the debt on which the application for winding up was made and that the solvency of the Company could not be determined before that dispute was decided, set aside the order of the Trial Judge and remanded the case to him.
The Federal Court held that the order appealed against was not a ""final order"".
In Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb vs The State of Bombay(4) a suit was filed for a declaration that the order of ex (1) L.R. 60LA.
76 (2) (3) (4) 703 communication passed by the appellant religious head of a community was invalid.
During the pendency of the suit them Bombay Prevention of Ex communication Act 42 of 1949 was enacted and one of the issues raised in the suit was whether the order of ex communication was invalid.
This issue was tried as a preliminary issue and as it raised the question of the vires of the Bombay prevention 'of Ex communication Act, 1949, the State of Bombay was impleaded as a party defendant in the suit.
The trial court decided the issue against the appellant and the order was confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Bombay.
Against the order deciding the issue, an appeal was preferred to this Court with certificate granted by the High Court under article 132 and article 133 of the Constitution, and it was held that the appeal was not maintainable since the decision on the issue did not finally dispose of the dispute between the parties.
In Srinivasa Prasad Singh vs Kesho Prasad Singh(1) an order deciding that circumstances had not been established such as would justify an order for stay of execution of a decree under appeal was not a 'final order"" and was on that account not appealable to the judicial Committee.
Similarly in Druva Coal Company vs Benaras Bank(2) it was held that an order by the High Court reversing the order of the Court of First Instance granting a temporary injunction was not a final order within the meaning of section 109 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
There is, therefore, 'abundant authority in support of the view that an order is final within the meaning of article 133 of the Constitution, under section 109 Code of Civil Procedure or section 205 of the Government of India Act, 1935, if it amounts to final decision on the rights of the parties in dispute in the suit or proceeding; if after the order is made, the suit or proceeding still remains to be tried, and the rights in disputes have to be determined, the order is interlocutory.
Counsel for the appellant strongly relied upon a recent judgment of this Court in Mohanlal Maganlal Thakkar vs State of Gujarat(3) and contended that the view expressed in the earlier cases is superseded.
In Mohanlal Thakkar 's case(a) after an enquiry under section 476 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, a Magistrate ordered that a complaint be filed against a person in respect of offences under sections 205, 467 and 468 read with section 114 I.P. Code.
In appeal the Additional Sessions Judge held that the complaint was competent only in respect of the offence under section 205 read with section 114.
The High Court dismissed a revision application against the order of the Court of Session.
Certificate was there (1) 13 C.L.J. 681.
(2) (3) ; 704 after issued by the High Court under article 134(1)(c) of the Con stitution for leave to appeal against the order.
The competence of the High Court to grant the certificate was challenged at the hearing of the appeal.
This Court held (Bachawat & Mitter JJ., dissenting) that the order passed was a final order within the meaning of article 134(1) (c) since the controversy between the parties when the the complaint in respect of offences under sections 467 and 468 read with section 114 I.P. Code was disposed of by the order of dismissal and the proceeding regarding that question was finally decided It was observed that the finality of that order was not to be judged by co relating it with the controversy in the complaint, viz., when then the appellant had committed the offence charged ,against him therein.
There is nothing in that judgment which supports the contention that this Court has departed from the principle of the earlier decisions or has suggested a different test for determining the finality of orders.
The Court in that case was concerned merely with an order passed by the High Court which maintained the order of the Additional Sessions Judge that a complaint under section 205 read with section 114 I.P. Code could be filed against the appellant.
The order of the High Court finally disposed of the proceeding in the Magistrate 's court relating to the expediency of instituting criminal proceedings against the appellant.
It was thereafter for the court trying the complaint to decide whether the offence complained of was committed by the appellant.
The proceeding for filing a complaint under section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was a self contained proceeding and was finally disposed of by the order directing the filing of a complain under section 205 read with section 114 I.P. Code.
The proceeding instituted on the complaint was not part of or incidental to the proceeding for an enquiry whether a complaint should be filed.
The Court in that case expressly approved of the earlier view at p. 736 where after referring to Kuppusami Rao 's case(1) observed: Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb 's case("") observed: "" . these were cases where the impugned orders were passed in appeals or revisions and since an appeal or a revision in continuation of the original suit or proceeding the test applied was whether the order disposed of the original suit or proceeding.
If it did not, and the suit or proceeding was a live one, yet to be tried, the order was held not to be final.
Different tests have been applied, however, to orders made in proceeding independent of the original or the main proceeding.
"" In our judgment an order passed by the High Court in appeal which does not finally dispose of a suit or proceeding and leave the rights and obligations of the parties for determination in the suit or proceeding from which appeal has arisen, is not final within (1) (2) E[1958] S.C.R. 1007.
705 he meaning of article 133(1)(a) and (b).
The order refusing to grant an interim injunction did not determine the rights and obligations of the parties in relation to the matter in dispute in the suit.
We are unable to hold that, because the plaintiff 's suit as a result of the order of the High Court may become infructuous as framed and the plaintiffs may have to seek amendment of the plaint to get effective relief, an order which is essentially an interlocutory order may be deemed final for the purposes of article 133 (1) of the Constitution.
In our judgment, Mohanlal Maganlal ThakKar 's case(1) makes no departure from the earlier judgments of the Judicial Committee, the Federal Court and this Court.
The plaintiffs will pay the costs of the petitioners of the application for revocation of the certificate.
G.C. Certificate revoked.
","M/s Tarapore & Co. who were plaintiffs in a suit applied for an interim injunction restraining the first defendant in the suit from taking any steps in pursuance of a letter of credit opened in favour of the second defendant.
A single judge of the High Court granted an interim injunction restraining encashment of the letters of credit pending disposal of the suit.
In appeals under the Letters Patent preferred by the second dependent, the High Court of Madras set aside that order.
Against the orders passed in the two appeals, the plaintiffs applied for certificate under articles 133(1) (a) and 133(1)(b) of the Constitution.
The High Court observed that an order granting interim injunction ""is a final order, as far as this Court is concerned, determining the rights of parties within this his or proceeding, which is independent though ancillary to the suit"", and they were competent to grant certificate.
In this Court the defendants applied for revocation of the certificate.
HELD: The certificate must be revoked.
An order passed by the, High Court in appeal which does not finally dispose of a suit or proceeding and leaves the rights and obligations of the parties for determination in the suit or proceeding from which the appeal has arisen, is not final within the meaning of article 133(1)(a) and (h).
The order refusing to grant an interim injunction did not determine the rights and obligations of the parties in relation to the matter in dispute in the suit.
It could not be held that because the plaintiffs suit as a result of the order of the High Court may become infructuous as framed and the plaintiff may have to amend his plaint to obtain effective relief an order which is essentially an interlocutory order may be deemed final for the purpose of article 133(1) of the Constitution.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hidayatullah, C.J.
The petitioners are persons employed in the ministerial services of the Andhra Pradesh Government.
All of them were working in various offices located in the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.
On January 19, 1969, leaders, of all political parties in the Legislature of the Andhra Pradesh State appeared to have met and reached the decision that to Implement what are called Telengana Safeguards ', the following measures should be taken : ""All non domicile persons, who have been appointed either directly, by promotion or by transfer to posts reserved under the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Rules, 1959 for domiciles of Telengana region will be immediately relieved from service.
The posts so rendered vacant will be filled by qualified candidates possessing domicile qualifications and in cases where such candidates are not available the posts shall be left unfilled till qualified domicile candidates become available Action on the above lines will be taken immediately.
All non domicile employees so relieved shall be provided employment in the Andhra region without break in service and by creating supernumerary posts, if necessary.
"" 117 The Government of Andhra Pradesh then passed an order (G.O.Ms. 36, G.A. (SR) Dept.) on January 21, 1969 relieving before February 28, 1969 all non domicile persons appointed on or after November 1, 1956 to certain categories of posts reserved for domiciles of Telengana under the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Rules, 1959.
Names of such incumbents were to be shown in a proforma and they were to be employed in the Andhra region without break in service by creating supernumerary posts, if necessary.
These supernumerary posts were to be treated as temporary addition to the strength of the office concerned and were to be adjusted against future vacancies in corresponding posts as they arose.
The action was based upon section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence Act, 1957 (44 of 1957) which was an Act of Parliament made in pursuance of cl.
(3) of article 16 of the Constitution making special provision for requirement as to residence and brought into force on March 21, 1959.
Section 3 of the Act gave the power to make Rules in respect of certain classes of employment in certain areas.
It provided: ""3.
Power to make rules in respect of certain classes of public employment in certain areas. (1)The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules prescribing, in regard to appointments to (a)any subordinate service or post under the State Government of Andhra Pradesh, or any requirement as to residence within the Telengana area or the said Union territory as the case may be, prior to such appointment.
(2) In this section, (a). . . . . (b)""Telengana area"" comprises all the territories specified in sub section (1) of section 3 of the ."" Under section 4, the Rules had to be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than 30 d s and Parliament could make such alterations as it liked.
Under section 5 the Rules had a life of 5 years but by subsequent legislation the period was extended to 10 years.
It is said that the period 118 is to be extended by another 5 years.
The Rules were made on March 21, 1959.
They are called the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Rules, 1959.
Rule 3 provides : ""3.
Requirement as to residence Prior to Appointment : A person shall not be eligible for appointment to a post within the Telengana area under the State Government of Andhra Pradesh or to a post under a local authority (other than a cantonment board) in the said area unless (i)he has been continuously residing within the said area for a period of not less than fifteen years immediately preceeding the prescribed date; and (ii)he produces before the appointing authority ,concerned, if so required by it, a certificate of eligibility granted under these rules; Provided that in relation to posts in the Secretariat Departments and the Offices of the Heads of Departments of the State Government of Andhra Pradesh situated in the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, the requirement as to residence laid down in this rule shall apply to the filling of only the second vacancy in every unit of three vacancies which are to be filled by direct requirement; Provided further that any period of temporary absence from Telengana area for the purpose of prosecuting his studies or for undergoing medical treatment or any period of such temporary absence not exceeding three months for any other reason shall not be deemed to constitute a break in the continuity of such residence, but for purpose of calculating the said period of fifteen years any such period of temporary absence shall be excluded.
"" The petitioners were appointed between December 27, 1956 and July 4, 1968.
They challenge the Act, the Rules and the proposed action as ultra vires the Constitution.
Their case is that article 16(3) under which the Act and the Rules purport to be made has been misunderstood as conferring a power to make, a law prescribing requirement as to residence in a part of a State.
For this reason section 3 of the Act is challenged as ultra vires the Constitution.
119 Article 16 on which the Act, the Rules and the present action are all based, reads : ""16.
Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.
(1)There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.
(2) No citizen shall, on ground only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated 'against in respect of, any employment or office under the State.
(3)Nothing in this article shall prevent Parliament from making any law prescribing, in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an office under the Government of, or any local or other authority within, a State or Union territory, any requirement as to residence within that State or Union territory prior to such employment or appointment.
(4). . . . (5). . . .
The question is one of construction of this article, particularly of the first three clauses, to find out the ambit of the law taking power of Parliament.
The first clause emphasises that ware shall be in India equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of employment or appointment to any office under the late.
The word 'State ' here is to be understood in the extended use given to it by the definition of that word article 12.
The second clause then specifies a prohibition against discrimination only on the grounds of religion, race, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them.
The intention here is make every office or employment open and available to every citizen, and inter alia to make offices or employment in one part India open to citizens in all other parts of India.
The third pause then makes an exception.
This clause was amended by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.
For the original words of the clause 'under any State specified in the First schedule or any local or other authority within its territory any requirement as to residence within that State ', the present words from 'under the Government ' to 'Union territory ' have been substituted.
Nothing turns upon the amendment which seeks to apply of the exception in the clause to Union territory and to remove ambiguity in language.
120 The clause thus enables Parliament to make a law in a special case prescribing any requirement As to residence within a State or Union territory prior to appointment, as a condition of employment in the State or Union territory.
Under article 35(a) this power is conferred upon Parliament but is denied to the Legislatures of the States, notwithstanding anything in the Constitution, and under (b) any law in force immediately before the commencement of the Constitution in respect to the matter shall subject to the terms thereof and subject to such adaptations that may be made under article 372 is to continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by Parliament.
The legislative power to create residential qualification for employment is thus exclusively conferred on Parliament.
Parliament can make any law which prescribes.
any requirement as to residence within the State or Union territory prior to employment or appointment to an office in that State or Union territory.
Two questions arise here.
Firstly, whether Parliament ', while prescribing the requirement, may prescribe the requirement of residence in a particular part of the State and, secondly, whether Par liament can delegate this function by making a declaration and leaving the details to be filled in by the rule making power of the Central or State Governments.
Mr. section V. Gupte, for the petitioners, points out that the ;Constitution is speaking of State and Union territory.
It has already made a declaration that no person shall be disqualified for any office in the territory of India because of his residence in any particular part of India.
The exception, therefore, must be viewed narrowly and not carried to excess by interpretation.
The article speaks of residence in a State and means only that.
If it chose to speak of residence in parts of State such as Districts, talauqas, cities, towns etc.
more appropriate and specific language could have been used such as 'any requirement as to residence within that State or Union territory or part of that State or Union territory '.
Having used the word State, the unit State is only meant and not any part thereof.
Reference is made to the history of the drafting of the Article and the debates in the Constituent Assembly which bear out this contention.
On the other hand, Mr. Setalvad bases his argument on two things.
He contends that the power is given to Parliament to make any law and, therefore, Parliament is supreme and can make any law on the subject as the article says.
He very ingeniously shifts the emphasis to the words 'any requirement ' and contends that the requirement may be also as to residence in the State or any particular part of state.
121 The claim for supremacy of Parliament is misconceived.
Par liament in this, as in other matters, is supreme only in so far as the Constitution makes it.
Where the Constitution does not concede supremacy, Parliament must, act within its appointed functions and not transgress them.
What the Constitution says is a matter for,construction of the language of the Constitution.
Which is the proper construction of the two suggested? By the first clause equality of opportunity in employment or appointment to an office is guaranteed.
By the second clause, there can be no discrimination, among other things, on the ground of residence.
Realising, however, that sometimes local sentiments may have to be respected or sometimes an inroad from more advance States into less developed States may have to be prevented, and a residential qualification may, therefore, have to be prescribed, the exception in clause (3) was made.
Even so,, that clause spoke of residence within the State.
The claim of Mr. Setalvad that Parliament can make a provision regarding residence in any particular part of a State would render the general prohibition lose all its meaning.
The words 'any requirement ' cannot be read to warrant something which could have been said more specifically.
These words bear upon the kind of residence or its duration rather than its location within the State.
We accept the argument of Mr. Gupte that the Constitution, as it stands, speaks of a whole State as the venue for residential qualification and it is impossible to think that the Constituent Assembly was thinking of residence in Districts, Taluqas, cities, towns or villages.
The fact that this clause is an exception and came as an amendment must dictate that a narrow construction upon the exception should be placed as indeed the debates in the Constituent Assembly also seem to indicate.
We accordingly reject the contention of Mr. Setalvad seeking to put a very wide and liberal construction upon the words 'any law ' and 'any requirement '.
These words are obviously controlled by the words 'residence within the State or Union territory ' which words mean what they say, neither more nor less.
It follows, therefore, that section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, in so far as it relates to Telengana (and we say nothing about the other parts) and Rule 3 of the Rules under it are ultra vires the Constitution.
In view of our conclusion on this point it is not necessary to express any opinion whether delegation to the Central and/or State Governments to provide by rules for the further implementing of the law made by Parliament is valid or not.
It was argued that the Mulki Rules existing in the former Hyderabad State must continue to operate by virtue of article 35(b) in this area.
This point is not raised by the petitions under consideration and no expression of opinion by us 'is desirable.
L12 Sup Cl/69 9 122 For the reasons given above we quash the orders passed and declare section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 as also Rule 3 of the Rules ultra vires the Constitution.
The petitions shall be allowed but there shall be no order about costs.
Y. P. Petitions allowed.
","The Parliament enacted the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 in pursuance of cl.
(3) of article 16 of the Constitution of India making special provision for requirement as to residence in public employment.
Section 3 of the Act gave the power to make rules in respect of certain classes of employment in certain areas, and accord ingly the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Rules were made prescribing the requirement , as to residence prior to appointment to certain posts, within the Telengana area of the State.
The petitioners who were non domicile persons appointed to the posts reserved for the domiciles of Telengana under the rules, were by an order relieved from their posts and employed in the other 'region of the State.
The petitioners, filed a petition under article 32 of the Constitution challenging the Act, the Rules and the order as ultra vires the Constitution.
Quashing the order, this Court, HELD : Section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 in so far as it related to, Telengana and Rule 3 of other Rules under it were ultra vires the Constitution.
[122 A] Clause (3) of article 16 of the Constitution enables Parliament to make a law in a special case prescribing any requirement as to residence within a State or Union Territory prior to appointment, in the State or Union Territory.
The provision speaks of a whole State as the venue for residential qualification and it is impossible to think that the Constituent Assembly was thinking of residence in Districts, Talukas, cities, towns or villages.
The fact that the clause is an exception and came as an amendment must dictate that a narrow construction upon the exception should be placed as indeed the debates in the Constituent Assembly also seem to, indicate.
The words 'any law ' and 'any requirement ' cannot be given wide and liberal construction.
These words are controlled by the words .
residence within the State or Union Territory ' which words mean what they say neither more or less.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J.
For the purpose of holding election to the .
Municipal Corporation of Raipur in the month of December, 1978 under the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 (No. 23 of 1956) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act '), the Collector of Raipur published the preliminary electoral roll on September 30, 1978 under Rule 4(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Munici 493 pal Corporation (Preparation, Revision and Publication of Electoral Rolls and Selection of Councillors) Rules, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules ') promulgated under the Act by the Madhya Pradesh State Government and issued a public notice under Rule 4(1) of the Rules calling upon persons whose names had not been included in the electoral roll and who claimed to be included in i. and persons who had any objection to the inclusion of the name of any person in the said electoral roll to submit their claims and/or objections within 20 days from the date of the publication of the said notice before Shri K. P. Pande, Deputy Collector, Raipur who had been authorised to pass orders on such claims or objections.
It was also notified that claims or objections which had not been preferred as required under the Rules within the prescribed period would be rejected.
The final publication of the electoral roll under Rule 8 of the Rules was done on November 16, 1978.
Thereafter the calendar of events was published on November 25, 1978 notifying that the poll, if necessary would take place on December 31, 1978 in all the 44 constituencies: Six petitioners including the appellants herein presented a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur on December 28, 1978 requesting the Court to make an order quashing the electoral roll and the calendar of events issued for the purpose of the said election and directing the respondents to refrain from conducting the poll on December 31, 1978.
They prayed for a further direction to be issued to the respondents calling upon them to hold the election after preparing the electoral roll afresh in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules.
They also prayed for the issue of an interim order staying the poll which had been fixed to be held on December 31, 1978.
On December 30, 1978, the learned Single Judge before whom the case came up for orders directed the issue of notice of the petition and the stay application to the respondents and issued an interim order directing the respondents not to notify the results of the election under Rule 46 of the Rules pending disposal of the petition.
On December 31, 1978, the poll was held and 44 persons were declared elected.
Their names were, however, not published under Rule 46 of the Rules in view of the interim order made by the Court.
Thereafter the successful candidates were also impleaded as respondents and the petition was amended by the inclusion of an additional prayer that the declaration of the results of the election should also be quashed.
After the respondents filed their counter affidavits, the petition was heard and it was dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court on January 20, 1979.
Aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court, Ashok Kumar Mishra and Bhagwat Singh Thakur (Petitioners No. 1 and 5 respectively in the 494 petition before the High Court) filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and Purshottam Lal Sharma (petitioner No. 6 before the High Court) filed another petition.
On special leave being granted, the above petitions were registered as appeals.
One of the grounds on which the appellants challenged the validity of the electoral roll, the calendar of events and the declaration of results of election was that the entire election process had become vitiated on account of the defect in the notice issued under Rule (1) of the Rules notifying that claims and objections should be preferred within a period of 20 days from the date of the publication of that notice when sub rule (3) of Rule 4 of the Rules prescribed that such claims and objections could be preferred within 30 days from the date of publication of that notice.
It was alleged that by reason of a shorter period being fixed for entertaining claims and objections, a large number or people who could have filed claims and objections were prevented from preferring them within 30 days from the date of publication or the notice which was the prescribed period.
It was alleged that petitioner No. 5 had filed a claim to include his name in the electoral roll on October 19, 1978 and that was rejected by the Deputy Collector without following the procedure prescribed for the purpose.
It was also alleged that on October 20, 1978, 34 persons mentioned in Annexure P 7 approached the Deputy Collector to entertain their claim for inclusion in the electoral roll and he refused to receive their applications.
It was contended that on account of noncompliance with Rule 4(3) of the Rules, which was mandatory, the entire election process held on the basis of the defective electoral roll '.
became a nullity and that therefore, the declaration of results of all the 44 successful candidates was liable to be quashed.
On behalf of the respondents, it was pleaded that while it was true that the period of 20 days had been mentioned in the notice issued under Rule 4(1) of the Rules, it was open to all the persons who were interested in preferring claims or objections to file them within 30 days from the date of publication of the notice under Rule 4(1).
It was pleaded that pursuant to the notice published under Rule 4(1) of the Rules only four claims including that of petitioner No. S were received by the Deputy Collector; that all the applicants were asked to appear on October 30, 1978 to substantiate their claim and that the applications were disposed of on October 30, 1978.
The claim of petitioner No. 5 was rejected as no evidence in support of his claim was produced before the Deputy Collector.
It was further pleaded that no other claims or objections were preferred either on October 20, 1978 or on any other sub sequent date.
The allegation that 34 persons had approached the Deputy 495 Collector requesting him to receive their applications for inclusion of their names in the electoral roll on October 20, 1978 was denied.
They further pleaded that the authorities would have taken action to correct the error in the notice issued under Rule 4(1) of the Rules granting 20 days ' time to prefer claims and objections if it had been brought to their notice by the petitioners immediately after it was noticed by them.
The petitioners were not entitled to any relief under Article 226 of the Constitution on account of the inordinate delay involved in the presentation of the writ petition.
The High Court after hearing the parties dismissed the petition holding (i) that respondent No. 2, the Deputy Collector had asked petitioner No. S to appear before him on October 30, 1978 and that as he did not produce any evidence in support of his claim, his application was dismissed, (ii) that none of the persons mentioned in Annexure P 7 preferred any claim before respondent No. 2 on October 20, 1978 and that he did not refuse to receive any such claim and that no person preferred any claim or objection after October 19, 1978 before respondent No. 2 and (iii) that the petitioners were not entitled to any relief as they had approached the Court after undue delay.
Since one of the grounds on which the High Court dismissed the petition was that the petitioners were not prompt in moving the High Court, we shall first examine whether the High Court was right in doing so, since if we agree with the High Court on the above question, it would become unnecessary to go into the other questions raised before us.
The Collector published the notice under Rule 4(1) of the Rules on September 30, 1978 and also called upon interested persons to prefer claims and/or objections thereto within a period of 20 days.
In paragraph 7 of the notice, it was mentioned that claims and objections received beyond the prescribed period would not be considered.
The period prescribed for preferring claims and objections under Rule 4(3) was 30 days.
It is not the case of the petitioners that they did not know immediately after the publication of such notice that in the said notice a period of 20 days had been mentioned in its preamble as the period within which the claims and objections could be preferred and in paragraph 7 thereof it had been stated that any such claim or objection filed beyond the prescribed period was liable to be rejected.
If they felt that the said notice suffered from any illegality, they could have brought it to the notice of the Collector immediately 496 thereafter.
It was open to them to move the State Government under Rule 6 of the Rules to make an order directing the Collector to follow .
the provisions governing the preparation of the electoral roll.
It was also open to them to file a writ petition immediately after the publication of the said notice questioning its legality.
None of the above courses was adopted by the petitioners.
Persons whose claims were rejected could have filed an appeal under Rule S before the Collector.
No such appeal was presented.
The final electoral roll was published on November 16, 1978.
It was notified that the nominations could be filed on and after November 25, 1978 and the poll, if necessary, would take place on December 31, 1978.
After November 25, 1978, a large number of nominations were received by the Returning officer.
It was only on December 5, 1978 for the first time that a letter was addressed by petitioner No. 6 to the Collector drawing his attention to the error that had crept into the notice published under Rule 4(1) of the Rules.
By that time, the nominations had all been received.
The final list of candidates for the election with their symbols was published on December 20, 1978.
The writ petition itself was filed on December 28, 19?8 when the poll had to take place on December 31, 1978.
When the petition came up for order on December 29, l 978, it had to be adjourned to December 30, 1978 at the request of the counsel for the petitioners.
No satisfactory explanation was given in the course of the petition by the petitioners as to why they delayed the filing of the petition till December 28, 1978 even though they knew that there was an error in the notice issued under Rule 4(1) of the Rules in the month of October, 1978 more than two months before the date on which i, was filed.
It was, however, argued before us relying upon a news item which had appeared in a daily called 'Nav Bharat ' dated October 21, 1978 in which there was a reference to a statement made by the Minister for Local Self Government of Madhya Pradesh regarding the irregularity in the division of Raipur town into different wards for purposes of election.
It was also stated therein that in the course of the discussion with the press reporters on that day, the Minister had stated that he had directed the Commissioner, Raipur Division, Raipur that the date for inclusion of names in the electoral roll could be extended if the election date was not affected.
There was a further reference to dates of election to Bilaspur Municipal Committee having been adjourned twice before.
It is difficult to place any reliance on the above news item for the purpose of concluding that the Collector, Raipur had been informed about the defect in the notice issued under Rule 4(1) of the Rules by October 21, 1978.
The other documents produced alongwith the writ petition referred to omissions of certain names from the electoral roll.
They do not show that any 497 of the petitioners had raised any objection with regard to the date within which the claims and objections could be preferred to the electoral roll mentioned in the notice.
We have, therefore, to proceed on the basis that it was only on December S, 1978 for the first time that the attention of the Collector was drawn to the said error and that the writ petition itself was presented on December 28, 1978.
No satisfactory reason for the delay was set out in the petition.
It is well settled that the power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue an appropriate writ is discretionary and if the High Court finds that there is not satisfactory explanation far the inordinate delay, it may reject the petition if it finds that the issue of Writ will lead to public inconvenience and interference with rights of others.
This rule applies also to a case in which the validity of an election to a local authority is challenged.
The question whether in a given case the delay involved is such that it dissentients a person to relief under Article 226 is a matter within the discretion of the High Court which as in all matters of discretion has to exercise it judiciously and reasonably having regard to the surrounding circumstances.
We are not, therefore, impressed by the argument that the petitioners were entitled to the issue of the writ prayed for as of right and the delay in filing the petition should have been ignored.
On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the writ petition was rightly dismissed by the High Court as there was no satisfactory explanation for the delay in preferring it.
We, therefore, find it unnecessary to deal with the other points urged before us.
For the foregoing reasons, the appeals fail and arc dismissed.
We make no order as to costs.
","On September 30, 1978 the Collector published the preliminary electoral roll under Rule 4(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation (Preparation, Revision and Publication of Electoral Rolls and Selection of Councillors) Rules, 1963 for the purpose of holding elections in December, 1978 to the Municipal Corporation, and also issued a notice under the said rule inviting claims or objections to be filed within twenty days from the date of publication of the notice.
A period of 30 days was however actually provided in the rule.
The final publication of the electoral roll was made on November 16, .1978.
After November 25, 1978 a large number of nominations were received by the Returning officer arid the final list of candidates for the elections with their symbols was published on December 20, 1978 and the poll took place on December 31, 1978.
The appellants (Petitioners 1, 5 and 6) along with some others in their writ petition filed on December 28, 1978 contended that the entire election process had become vitiated on account of the defect in the notice issued by the Collector under Rule 4 (1) providing 20 days for preferring claims and objections while the rule prescribed 30 days and that by non compliance with this mandatory requirement, the entire election process held on the basis of the defective electoral roll, became a nullity and therefore the declaration of results of the successful candidates was liable to be quashed.
The High Court held that the appellants were not entitled to any relief as they had approached the Court after undue delay.
Dismissing the appeals this Court, ^ HELD: 1.

2392,"iminal Appeal No.112 of 1965.
Appeal by special leave from the jurisdiction and order dated April 29, 1965 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Misc. 'Contempt Case No. 43 of 1965.
A. section R. Chari, M. K. Ramamurthi, Vineet Kumar and Shyamala Pappu, for the appellants.
O. P. Rana, for respondent No. 1.
J. P. Goyal, V. C. Prasar and section P. Singh for respondent No. 2.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, J.
This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court adjudging the five appellants guilty of contempt of court and sentencing each of them to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000/ and further ordering that in case of default they shall undergo simple imprisonment for two weeks.
The High Court held that the five appellants had disobeyed an order of stay passed by it staying proceedings pending before the Nyaya Panchayat, Jokha Khas, District Deoria.
The relevant facts are these.
On September 2, 1963, Yashoda, son of Raj Kumar, filed a complaint before the Nyaya Panchayat, Jokha Khas, against Jagdeo, Mahabir and Laxmi alleging that he had been abused and be laboured and his property worth Rs. 40/ damaged.
On September 10, 1963, the Nyaya Panchayat assembled and evidence was led before it.
The case was adjourned to December 25, 1963.
On October 11, 1963, Mahabir, accused, made an application under section 85 of the U.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1947, to S.D.M., Deoria, to transfer the proceedings on the ground that the complainant Yashoda was father of Bunna Prasad, Sarpanch of Nyaya Panchayat, Jokha Khas.
On November 28, 1963, the S.D.M. rejected this application.
On December 13, 1963, a notice was issued to the five members of the Panchayat to assemble on December 25, 1963, and hear the case.
On December 20, 1963, Mahabir moved an application under article 227 of the Constitution challenging the order of the S.D.M., dated November 28, 1963, and on the same day the High Court admitted the application and stayed further proceedings before the Nyaya Panchayat.
An urgent copy of the order was applied for and obtained on that very day and the counsel sent a telegram in the following words ""Allahabad He 20 Baldeopd cashier Trust Sdr GR Mahabir application admitted stay granted Banwarilal.
"" 117 It is alleged on the side of the applicant, Mahabir, that immediately after the receipt of the telegram an application accompanied by an affidavit and the telegram of his counsel in the High Court was presented before the Nyaya Panchayat with the prayer to stay further proceedings but the Sarpanch refused to take it.
This fact was denied and the High Court seems not to have relied on this fact in its judgment.
It seems to us that it is not proved on the evidence here that any such application was made before the Nyaya Panchayat.
No application dated December 21, 1963, which was not accepted by the Nyaya Panchayat, has been produced.
On December 23, 1963, Mahabir submitted an application in the Court of Shri R. Singh, S.D.M., Deoria, alleging that ""writ petition has been admitted and a stay order has been issued.
But notwithstanding my informing the Panchayat Adalat of that, I am not getting any hearing there, and when an application is made there, it is not entertained."" He prayed that the Panchayat Adalat be directed to postpone proceedings pending the receipt of the stay order.
He produced the telegram received from the Advocate before the S.D.M.
In the affidavit accompanying the application, however, no mention was made about Mahabir having informed the Panchayat Adalat of the stay order or the fact that the order and the application was not being entertained by the Adalat.
It happened that the S.D.M. was absent on December 23, 1963, and papers were put up before Shri section K. Srivas tava, Additional Sub Divisional Magistrate, who issued the order ""Put up with records"".
Apparently he did not take any further action till December 26, 1963.
But as the notice against Shri Srivastava has been discharged by the High Court, we need not give any further details about his various orders, On December 25, 1963, the Nyaya Panchayat met and proceeded to hear the case.
The order sheet reads thus : ""Put up today the 25th December, 1963.
The complainant and the accused are present.
The statements of the complainant and his witnesses, Bhabhuti and Damri, are recorded.
The accused refused to make statements and put down their signatures.
Today, the 25th December, 1963, Mahabir has made an applica tion to the Court and signed it before it.
Hence judgment shall be given on 25 12 63.
"" This order was signed by three Panchas, Phagu Parsad, Jagat Dubey and Badri Yadav.
On the same day a final order was made holding the accused guilty and imposing a fine of Rs. 3/ each on accused Nos. 1 and 3, and Rs. 9/ on accused No. 2.
The application of Mahabir, referred to in the order, reads thus: 118 .lm15
Sir, It is submitted that I have filed a writ petition in the above case, in the High Court.
It has been admitted by the High Court which has stayed proceedings also in this case.
It is, therefore, prayed that the proceedings in this case may be stayed."" A document purporting to be an affidavit was also attached, in which it was stated ""I make oath and say that in the above case I have filed a writ petition in the High Court, that it has been admitted, and that proceedings in the case have been stayed by the High Court.
"" We looked at this so called affidavit and found.
that it has not been sworn to before any person authorised to administer oaths.
On May 21, 1964, Mahabir filed an application under sections 4 and 5 of the , against the five appellants and section K. Srivastava, A.S.D.M.
The main allegation, apart from reciting the facts which we have already detailed above, was that ""in spite of the knowledge of the interim stay dated 20 12 63 passed by the Hon 'ble High Court the Sarpanch, the Opposite Party No. 1 and the members of the Bench, Opposite Parties Nos. 2 to 5 disobeyed the order of the Hon 'ble High Court and disposed of the case on 25 12 63 and thus they committed contempt of the Hon 'ble High Court.
"" Affidavits were filed in the High Court by Baldeo Prasad, pairokar of Mahabir, Burma Prasad, the Sarpanch, and Mahabir, and statements of Phagu Prasad and Bunna Prasad were recorded on oath.
Bunna Prasad, in his affidavit, stated that as the Nyaya Panchayat was not satisfied for want of evidence by way of proper affidavit etc.
, the Nyaya Panchayats proceeded with the case.
Phagu Prasad.
in his statement, stated ""As the paper of Mahabir 's application and affidavit was not good, we had asked him to get them written on a proper paper obtained from the Tehsil.
We had also told him to get the affidavit verified before some Tehsil authority.
We had told Mahabir as above before we had read the application and affidavit presented before the Nyaya Panchayat.
Mahabir told us that he is not prepared to go to Tehsil, but is presenting before the Panchayat whatever he has got in his possession."" Phagu Prasad further stated that ""no other affidavit had ever been filed before us, but we knew that in the law courts the 119 affidavits,which are filed, are verified by some authority.""He further added that ""the reason why we did not believe theaffidavit of Mahabir was that it did not contain any date of theHigh Court 's stay order."" Bunna Prasad, in his statement, stated that he had told Mahabir to bring the affidavit on a good quality paper of full size, and Mahabir thereupon told him that he would present whatever he had.
According to him, the Panchas did not tell Mahabir that his affidavit was not proper; they, however, told him to get it verified in Tehsil and that it should be duly sealed.
The High Court, on examination of the evidence, came to the conclusion that it was the Sarpanch who bad initially declared that the affidavit of the applicant was not proper and that the matter should file a proper affidavit in support of his allegations, though the Sarpanch had admitted in his deposition that he had to authority to tell Mahabir that his affidavit was not proper.
It appeared to the High Court that ""the Sarpanch first wanted to avoid the petitioner 's affidavit being brought on the record by declaring that it was not proper because it did not fully evidence the fact that the High Court had passed an order staying proceedings before the Nyaya Panchayat."" The High Court further held that ""the Nyaya Panchas faithfully accepted the objections raised by the Sarpanch and dittoed him about the impropriety of the petitioner 's affidavit and inadequacy of the evidence contained therein regarding the stay order alleged to have been.
passed by the High Court.
"" The High Court disbelieved the explanation of the Panchas given before it because no mention of these was made in the order sheet dated December 25, 1963.
The High Court held : ""There was no reasonable ground for the Panchas to have doubted the averments made in the application and affidavit of Mahabir that the High Court had stayed further proceedings before the Panchayat, nor is there any thing in the order sheet to show that the Panchas did not believe the contents of the application, and affidavit of Mahabir.
However, if they wanted to ascertain the matter, they should have at best stayed the proceedings for a short while and should have asked the applicant to produce a certified copy of the stay order.
In the alternative, they should have verified from the Sub Divi sional Magistrate whether Mahabir had really filed an application and affidavit before him along with the original telegram received from his counsel at Allahabad saying that the High Court had already stayed the proceedings before the Nyaya Panchayat.
But the Panchas did nothing of the kind.
The action of the Nyaya Panchas in not doing so was obviously not bona fide and 120 amounts to wilful disobedience of the High Court 's order.
The learned counsel for the appellants, Mr. Chari, says that no contempt of court has been established because a Court is entitled not to act on an application which is not accompanied by an affidavit properly sworn to or a certified copy of the order He urges that the Nyaya Panchayats exercised judicial powers and, even if the Panchas erred in not staying proceedings, before finding them guilty of contempt of court it should be definitely proved that the order was passed deliberately to by pass the order of the High Court.
This Court quoted with approval the following passage from Oswald 's Contempt of Court, in Hoshiar Singh vs Gurbachan.
Singh(1): ""The judgment or order should be served on the party personally, except in the following cases : (1) prohibitive orders, the drawing up of which is not completed;. .
In order to justify committal for breach of a prohibitive order it is not necessary that the order should have been served upon the party against whom it has been granted, if it be proved that he had notice of the order aliunde, as by telegram, or newspaper report, or otherwise, and knew that it was intended to be enforced, or if he consented to the order, or if he was present in Court when the order Was pronounced, or *hen the motion was made, although he left before the order was pronounced.
"" We need not consider whether it makes any differnce in law if the order has been drawn up.
We will for the purpose of this case assume that it does not make any difference.
It is also clear that in such matters those who assert that a person had knowledge of the order must prove this fact beyond all reasonable doubt.
If there is any doubt, the benefit ought to be given to the person charged with contempt of court.
If a person bona fide comes to the conclusion on the material placed before him that the source of information is not authentic he cannot be held guilty of contempt of court for disobeying the order.
The question then arises whether the Sarpanch and the Pan chas had knowledge of the existence of the order of the High Court dated December 20, 1963.
The only material before them was the application dated December 25, 1963, which was not supported by any affidavit sworn to before a person authorised to (1) [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 127,138.
121 administer oaths.
Further, the application did not contain the .date of the order; even a copy of the telegram was not attached to the application; and the application seems to have been made after the proceedings on that date had commenced and evidence taken.
We are unable to appreciate how on this material the bona fides of the Panchas can be doubted if they refused to accept the mere statement of the party that the High Court had stayed proceedings before them.
It seems to us that the High Court did not appreciate that the so called affidavit which was filed before the Panchas was in fact not an affidavit at all.
it had not been sworn to before any person authorised to administer oaths.
It was no part of the duty of the Panchas to enquire from the S.D.M. about the filing of the application before him.
At any rate, he has apparently no jurisdiction to stay proceedings before the Nyaya Panchayats when no Proceeding is pending before him.
It is true that in certain cases proceedings can be adjourned to enable the parties to file better proof, but a judicial officer is not bound to do so and, if he bona fide does not in his discretion adjourn proceedings, it cannot be said that he has committed contempt of court.
It must also be borne in mind that Panchas are not well versed in law and procedure and the records maintained by them should not be judged in the same manner as that of ordinary courts.
With respect, the High Court should not have drawn an adverse inference from the fact that the reasons for not accepting the prayer for stay were not recorded.
Contempt of court is a serious matter and a High Court should be chary of finding a judicial officer guilty of contempt of court for disobeying its orders unless there is unimpeachable evidence that the judicial officer had knowledge of the order of the High Court.
In our opinion, there is no such evidence in this case.
The learned counsel for the State contends that we should not reappreciate the facts, but, with respects, it seems to us that the High Court, while dealing with the evidence, has not kept in mind the principles which we have mentioned above.
In the result we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment and order of the High Court.
R.K.P.S. Appeal allowed.
","M, an accused person in certain proceedings pending before the Nyaya Panchayat filed a petition under article 227 in the High Court and obtained a stay of the proceedings on December 20, 1963 .
Thereafter when the Panchayat met to proceed with the matter, he made an application supported by a document purporting to be an affidavit stating that the High Court had admitted his writ petition and had stayed further proceedings before the Panchayat; and that therefore nothing further should be done in the matter.
However, the, Panchayat did not allow his application and proceeded (to hold M and others guilty and imposing fines on them.
M, thereafter filed an application under sections 4 and 5 of the , alleging contempt of the High Court by the Panchayat.
An affidavit filed before the High Court by the Sarpanch stated that the document filed by M, by way of an affidavit in support of his application had not been verified by any proper authority and for this and other reasons the Panchayat did not believe that the High Court had stayed the proceedings.
The High Court held the members of the Panchayat guilty of contempt and observed that if they wanted to ascertain the matter, they should have at best stayed the proceedings for a short while and asked the applicant to produce a certified copy of the stay order; in not doing so, the Panchas had obviously not acted bona fide and their action amounted to, wilful disobedience of the High Court 's order.
On appeal to this Court, HELD : The appeal must be allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court set aside.
The only material before the Panchayat was the application dated December 25.
1963, which was not supported by 'any affidavit sworn to before a person authorised to administer oaths.
Further, the application did not contain the date of the order; even a copy of the telegram stated to have been sent by M 's advocate in the High Court was not attached to the application.
On this material the bona fides of the Panchas could not be doubted if they refused to accept the mere statement of the party that the High Court had stayed the proceedings before them.
In such matters those who assert that a person had knowledge of the order must prove this fact beyond all reasonable doubt.
If there is any doubt.
the benefit, ought to be given to the person charged with contempt of court.[120 F H; 121 A B] It is true that in certain cases proceedings can be adjourned to enable the parties to file better proof, but a judicial officer is not bound (to do so and, if the bona fide does not in his discretion adjourn proceedings, it cannot be said that he has committed contempt of court.

2124,"il Appeal Nos. 931 and 1149 of 1965.
Appeals from the judgment and decree dated July 31, 1964 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal from Original Decree No. 613 of 1962.
N. C. Chatterjee, Janaradan Sharma, K. B. Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan, for the appellant (in C.A. No. 931 of 1965) and the respondent (in C. A. No. 1149 of 1965).
D.N. Mukherjee, for the respondent (in C.A. No. 931 of 1965) and the appellant (in C.A. No. 1149 of 1965).
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sarkar, C.J.
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as ""a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste"".
Sudhir objected to this nomination contending that Abhoy Pada did not belong to any Scheduled Caste.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
At the election which 388 ensued, Abhoy Pada secured 16,730 votes and Sudhir, 15,523 and the former was consequently declared elected.
Sudhir then filed a petition challenging the validity of Abhoy Pada 's election on various grounds.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal, however, he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
The Election Tribunal rejected this contention and dismissed the petition.
Sudhir then appealed to the High Court at Calcutta which reversed the decision of the Tribunal and declared the election of Abhoy Pada invalid and set it aside on the ground that he did not belong to a Scheduled Caste.
In his petition Sudhir had further claimed that he should be declared elected in the place of the appellant if the latter 's election was found to be invalid.
This prayer, however, was rejected by the High Court.
These two appeals are from the judgment of the High Court.
Appeal No. 931 of 1965 is by Abhoy Pada.
He challenges the validity of the order of the High Court setting aside his election.
Appeal No. 1149 of 1965 is by Sudhir and he challenges the validity of the order of the High Court rejecting his prayer to be declared elected.
We shall first deal with Appeal No. 931 of 1965 filed by Abhoy Pada and shall hereafter refer to him as the appellant and Sudhir as the respondent.
article 332 of the Constitution provides that seats shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes in the Legislative Assembly of every State.
article 341 gives power to the President to specify by public notification the castes or parts of or groups within castes which shall for the purpose of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes.
The President, on August 10, 1950, passed the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 under article 341 setting out in its schedule the various castes which were declared Sche duled Castes.
This Order was amended from time to time by statutes passed by Parliament and it is agreed that at the relevant time Item 40 of Part 13 of the schedule to the Order which set out which were Scheduled Castes in West Bengal stood as follows: ""Sunri excluding Saha"".
Item 40 and some other items of the schedule were made applicable to the State of West Bengal except the Purulia District and the territories transferred from Purnea District of Bihar and it is with this item that we are concerned.
The question is, whether the appellant was a member of the Scheduled Caste specified in this item.
In the election petition, the respondent had stated that the appellant, was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
It was said that this showed that the respondent 's case was that the appellant belonged to an independent caste which had nothing to do with Sunri caste and that it was, therefore, not c open to him at the trial to contend, as he appears to have done.
389 that the appellant was a Sunri by caste but was excluded from the Scheduled Caste group because he belonged to a smaller caste group of Sunirs known as Sahas.
We are unable to take this strict view of the pleading.
The petition may, in our opinion, be reasonably read as stating that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste, a smaller caste group within the bigger caste group of Sunirs and was for that reason not a member of the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40.
We also observe that this reading of the petition which was accepted by the Election Tribunal, did not cause any surprise to the appellant at the trial or result in any injustice.
The High Court also read the petition in the same way.
In our view, it was open to the respondent to show that the appellant belonged to the Saha caste group within the Sunri caste group and did not, therefore, belong to the Schedule Caste specified in item 40 as he claimed.
The Tribunal rejected the respondent 's case that the Sunri caste was divided into certain groups of which the Sahas formed one.
It came to the conclusion that the Sahas originally belonged to the Sunri caste but for a long time past they had formed themselves into a different caste which had no connection with the Sunris.
It is not very clear whether the Tribunal thought that the Sahas were originally a smaller caste group within the Sunri caste group or were only distinguished from the other Sunris by their surname.
We are, however, inclined to think that the Tribunal thought that the Sahas were originally a smaller caste group within the Sunri caste because it rejected a contention advanced by the respondent that item 40 excluded from Sunirs those who bore the surname Saha observing that the names given in the schedule to the Order all referred to castes, subcaliber or groups.
It found that the evidence clearly established that the appellant belonged to the Sunri caste a fact which appears to have been admitted by the respondent and, therefore, did not belong to the independent caste which according to the Tribunal, the Sahas have formed for a long time past.
In that view of the matter, the Tribunal held the appellant to be a Sunri and a person belonging to the Schedule Caste specified in item 40 and, therefore, dismissed the election petition.
It took the view that item 40 had excluded Sahas from Sunirs by way of abundant caution, so that the Sahas who had originally belonged to the Sunri caste but had long 'ago severed all connections with it and developed into a distinct and independent caste, might not claim, by virtue of their origin, to belong to the Sunri caste stated in the item.
In the High Court P. N. Mookerjee, J. observed that the Tribunal had gone wrong in considering the Sahas as an independent caste.
He said that the expression ""excluding"" denoted that the Sahas contemplated would, but for this word, have come within the Sunri caste.
He held that the Sahas formed ""a group within the Sunri caste be it a sub caste strictly so called or other 390 wise"".
He also held that the evidence did not establish that the Sahas formed a sub caste strictly so called within the Sunri caste of a caste wholly independent of the Sunri caste.
His conclusion was that the expression ""excluding Saba"" referred to those Sunris who bore the surname Saha irrespective of whether they belonged to a sub caste strictly so called, of Sunris or not.
The learned Judge, therefore, held that as the appellant bore the surname Saha, he did not belong to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40 though he was a Sunri.
The other learned Judge, Basu, J. held that the words ""parts or groups within castes"" in article 341 were wide enough to refer to any determinate part of a caste distinguished by a surname or otherwise and it was not necessary that such part must necessarily form a sub caste.
He also held that the evidence broadly supported ""the conclusion that the respondent 's family belongs to the Saba sub caste or group within the Sunri caste"".
The learned Judge however, appears to have set aside the decision of the Tribunal and directed the election of the appellant to be set aside on the ground that the appellant bore the surname Saha and was thereby excluded from the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40 for he said ""these Saha families, within the fold of Sunri caste, distinguished themselves by their surname, whatever might be their other characteristics"" and have come to form a class apart from the rest of the Sunris.
Now, the point in issue is, whether the appellant satisfied the description ""Sunri excluding Saha"" in item 40 of the President 's Order.
To decide that point, the description has first to be properly interpreted and understood.
As we have said, the Tribunal thought that the Sahas formed a distinct caste wholly outside the Sunri caste and they had been specifically excluded in item 40 for greater safety o prevent them from claiming to be Sunris by reason of their origin.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
We are unable to agree with either of these interpretations.
There is no doubt that Sunri is a caste.
Nobody disputes that.
That also follows from the fact that the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 was promulgated to indicate those castes who are to be considered as Scheduled Castes for the purpose of the Constitution.
""Sunri"" in item 40, therefore.
refers to a caste.
If Sunri is a caste, the word 'Saha ' in the expression ""excluding Saha"" in the item must, without more.
also refer to a caste group within the Sunri caste.
It is legitimate to think that when a statute says that a thing is to be excluded from another, both things are of the same kind; if one is a caste.
the other must be a caste.
It follows that when the item excluded Sahas from Sunris, since Sunri is a caste group, Saha must equally be another caste group.
The Tribunal appears to have taken the same view.
Now a thing can be 391 excluded from another only if it was otherwise within it.
Therefore, the correct interpretation of the item is that it indicates men of the Sunri caste but not those within that caste who formed the smaller caste group of Sahas.
This is where the Tribunal went wrong.
The Tribunal came to its conclusion that ""Saha"" in the item referred to a caste distinct from the Sunri caste because the evidence before it did not show that there was within the Sunri caste, a smaller caste group called Sahas.
The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
There was no justification for doing that.
After all, the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
Suppose the evidence in another case led to the conclusion, as it might conceivably do, that there was a smaller caste group within the Sunri caste, called Sahas.
In that case, if the reasoning applied by the Tribunal is right, it has to be held that the expression ""excluding Saha"" meant excluding a smaller caste group called Sahas.
A method of interpreting a statutory provision which might lead to such uncertainty cannot be correct.
If the correct interpretation of item 40 was, as we think it was, that Sahas were a caste group within the Sunri caste, no question of Sahas being a distinct class independent of Sunris ,could arise.
The finding that Sahas were a wholly independent caste was altogether irrelevant to the point in issue.
Evidence cannot alter the natural interpretation of the words in the Order.
For the same reason, we are unable to agree with the interpretation of the High Court that the Sahas excluded were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha.
We think the learned Judges of the High Court also interpreted item 40 in the light of the evidence in the case.
If the intention was to exclude from Sunris those members of that caste who bore the surname Saha, the item would have said so; it would then have read ""Sunri excluding those who bore the surname Saha"".
In the absence of such words ""Saha"" must, in the context, be understood as referring to a smaller caste group within the bigger caste group of Sunris.
Surname is irrelevant as a test for applying item 40 unless it is shown that it indicated a smaller caste group of Sunris.
It is nobody 's case that there is evidence to show that.
It is of interest to remind in the connection that the Order provides that the Sunris in the Purulia District and those parts of the Purnea District which had been transferred to West Bengal were not to be considered as belonging to a Scheduled Caste.
That would show that where the exclusion is by a test other than a caste group, the Order expressly says so.
It is natural to think that if the excluded Sahas were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha, the Order would have made that clear.
In our opinion, the learned Judges of the High Court were in error in interpreting the item on the evidence in the case as they appear to have done.
L/S5SCI 27 392 If we are right in our interpretation of item 40, then the only question that has to be decided in this case is, whether the respondent has established that the appellant belonged to a smaller caste group called Sahas within the Sunri caste.
This question presents no difficulty.
The respondent called witnesses to establish that the appellant belonged to the smaller caste group of Sahas.
These witnesses were disbelieved by the Tribunal which described them as unreliable.
P.N. Mookerjee, J. said, ""it has not been proved that the respondent (appellant here) belonged to any separate Saha caste or to any Saha Sunri sub caste of the Sunri caste"".
Though Basu, J. said that the appellant belonged to the Saha group of Sunris, it would appear that 'he was thinking of that group as consisting of those Sunris who bore the surname Saha.
All the courts in West 'Bengal, therefore, came to the conclusion that it had not been prov ed in this case that the appellant belonged to the smaller caste group of Sahas.
We have no reason to take a different view of the evidence.
The result then is, that the appellant is a Sunri by caste and has not been proved to belong to the smaller caste group of Sahas.
He must be held to belong to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40.
That being so, the election petition must fail.
Accordingly, we allow Appeal No. 931 of 1965 and set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore that of the Election Tribunal dismissing the petition.
The appellant will get the costs throughout.
In the view that we have taken in Appeal No. 931 of 1965, the other appeal must necessarily be dismissed and we, therefore, dismiss it with costs.
One set of hearing fees only.
Appeal No. 931 of 1965 allowed.
Appeal No. 1149 of 1965 dismissed.
","When item 40 of Part 13 of the Schedule to the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, declared ""Sunris excluding Sahas"" as a Schduled Caste, it indicates that men of Sunri caste but not those within that caste who formed the smaller caste group of Sahas, are members of a Scheduled Caste.
It does not indicate that Sahas are a caste distinct from the Sunri caste, nor was it intended to exclude from Sunris those members of that caste who bore the surname Saha.
[391 A, D].
Therefore, when the respondent challenged the election to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, of the appellant who described himself as a member of the Sunri caste, on the ground that he was a member of the Saha caste group but failed to prove the allegation, it must be held that the appellant was a Sunri by caste and belonged to the Scheduled caste specified in the item, even though he bore the surname Saha.

3924,": Criminal Appeal No 133 of 1975.
Appeal from the Judgment and order dated 3 2 1978 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Crl.
A. No. 628/73.
R. Nagarathnam for the Appellant.
P. Parmeswara Rao and G. N. Rao for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA REDDY, J.
This appeal has been filed under Section 2(a) of the .
The appellant was acquitted by the learned Additional Sessions judge, Chittoor of an offence under Section 302, Indian Penal Code.
The acquittal was reversed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the appellant was convicted under Section 302 Indian Penal Code and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life.
365 The deceased Subhadramma was the wife of the appellant.
They were married about one and a half years before the occurrence.
About three months before the occurrence the deceased gave birth to a female child in the house of the accused at Cherlopalle.
After the ninth day the mother and child, according to customary practice, were taken by the mother of the deceased to her house at Krishna Kalva.
Cherlopalle is about 25 miles from Krishna Kalva.
The accused used to visit his wife and often used to stay in the house of the deceased 's mother.
After about one and a half months the, accused asked his mother in law and brother in law to send his wife to his place.
They replied that she had only delivered a child recently and that she would be sent to her husband 's house in the fifth month.
On 18th December, 1972, according to the case of the prosecution the accused once again requested his mother in law to send his wife to his house.
This time he also brought with him P.W. 8, an elderly gentleman from his village.
His mother in law P.W. 2 told him that she would send the girl in the fifth month as she had not yet regained her health after delivery.
The accused and P. W. 8 went away.
That evening the accused again came to the house of his mother in law.
After dinner all of them went to sleep.
The house consisted of only one room.
The accused, the deceased, her brother P.W. 1, her mother P.W. 2 and her grand mother P.W. 3 were all sleeping in the room.
In the middle of the night P.Ws. 1, 2 and 3 were awakened by the cry ""Amma"" raised by Subhadramma.
On waking up they saw the accused sitting by the side of the deceased with a knife in his hand.
They found the deceased bleeding profusely from the left side of her chest.
P.W. 1 put his foot on the hand in which the accused was holding the knife.
The accused dropped the knife which was then picked up by the grand mother P.W. 3.
Attracted by the cries raised by the P.Ws. 1 to 3, the neighbourers P. Ws. 4, 5, 6 and others came there.
They caught hold of the accused and tied him to a pole in front of the house by means of a rope.
Some of the villagers who had gathered there also gave a beating to the accused P.W. proceeded to the house of P.W. 9 the Village Munsif and reported the occurrence to him.
P. W. 1 affixed his thumb impression on the report exhibit P. 1 prepared by P. W. 9.
P. W. 9 then proceeded to the house of P.W. 1 where the blood stained knife M.O. 1 was handed over to him.
Thereafter, P. W. 9 prepared his own report exhibit P. 4 and sent it alongwith exhibit P. 1 and M.O. 1 to the Police Station at Renigunta.
P. W. 14, the Sub Inspector of Police registered the First Information Report at 5 A. M. on 19th December, 1972 and went ahead with the further investigation which was later taken over by the Inspector of Police P.W. 15.
When the Police officers went to the village, they 366 found the accused tied to a pole.
They arrested him and found that he had injuries on his person.
They got him examined by a Doctor.
After holding the inquest the dead body was sent for postmortem examination.
The Medical Officer, P. W. 12 who conducted the autopsy, found on the dead body a stab wound over the left axila 6 cms.
below the arm pit 1.75 cms x 0.5 cm.
nearly horizontal.
The stab injury had gone through the third intercostal space and through the upper lobe of the left lung in an upward and medial direction.
The upper lobe of the left lung had been cut through and through,, and had collapsed.
P. W. 13 the Medical officer who examined the accused found several abrasions and contusions on the person of the accused.
There was no fracture.
After completing the investigation the Police laid a chargesheet against the accused and he was duly tried.
The plea of the accused was one of denial.
In the Committing Court the accused was content with a bare denial but in the Court of Sessions he stated that he went to the house of his mother in law at about 10 p.m.
On 18th December, 1972.
P. Ws. 1 and 2 taunted him saying ""we are maintaining you and your wife, yet you come at any time you like` '.
They insulted him.
There was an altercation.
P.W. 3 hit him with a stone near his left eye.
P. W. 1 beat him with a stick two or three times.
He felt giddy and was about to lose consciousness.
P. W. 1 came upon him with a knife to stab him.
The deceased intervened and interposed herself between P.W. 1 and the accused.
She received a stab injury.
Seeing his wife injured, he fell down unconscious.
He regained consciousness next morning.
The Learned Sessions Judge held that the prosecution had failed to establish any motive and that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was 'discrepant, conflicting and improbable. ' He thought that the prosecution had made an attempt to improve its case which was originally based on circumstantial evidence to made it appear as if P.W. 3 had also seen the stabbing.
He commented on the failure of the Police to seize the mat or bedding on which the deceased was sleeping.
He referred to the evidence of me Doctor who stated that the injury found on the deceased could have been caused even if she was standing.
The learned Sessions Judge thought that when there were two divergent versions given by the prosecution and the defence and when two views were possible, the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused.
He, therefore, acquitted the accused.
The High Court reversed the finding of acquittal.
The learned Judges pointed out that there was no reason to doubt the testimony of P. Ws. 1 to 3 and that the discrepancies noticed by the learned Sessions 367 Judge were of a minor character.
The High Court observed that the learned Sessions Judge had magnified the importance to be attached to minor discrepancies.
The High Court also concluded from the medical evidence that it was more probable that the deceased was stabbed when she was lying down.
Accepting the evidence of P. Ws. 1 to 3 which was corroborated by the evidence of P. Ws. 4 and 5 who came to the scene soon afterwards, the High Court convicted the accused under Section 302 and sentenced him as aforesaid.
In this appeal the learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the accused had no motive to kill his wife and that his version was more probable than the version of the prosecution.
He submitted that the version of the accused that the occurrence took place at about 10 p.m. was substantiated by what was mentioned in exhibit P. 15 the wound certificate given by P.W. 13 the Medical officer in respect of the injuries which he found on the person of the accused.
He urged that the knife was not seized by the Police under any seizure Memo nor was the knife sent to any finger print expert.
He urged that at the reasons given by the learned Sessions Judge had not been met by the High Court.
He also contended that two views were possible on the evidence and the accused was entitled to the benefit of doubt.
We have perused the relevant evidence as well as the judgments of the Sessions Judge and the High Court.
We are unable to find any substance in the submissions made by the, learned Counsel for the appellant.
The High Court was well justified in commenting that the discrepancies on the basis of which the Trial Court rejected the evidence of P. Ws. 1, 2 and 3 were of a minor character and that they have been unduly magnified by the learned Sessions Judge.
The discrepancies were in regard to which of them woke up first, where was the lantern and which of the neighbours came first to the scene on hearing their cries.
The High Court was also right in holding that the medical evidence supported the prosecution version and not the defence version.
Merely because the Medical Officer stated that the victim could have received the injury if she was standing, it did not follow that the injury could have been received in the circumstances mentioned by the accused.
The injury was inflicted with great force and its direction was upward.
The location of the injury was 6 cms.
below the arm pit on the left side.
According to the accused the deceased received the injury when she placed herself between P. W. 1 and himself.
We do not think that an injury of the nature received by the deceased could have been caused in the manner suggested by the accused.
The injury must have been caused in the manner suggested by the prosecution that 368 is, when the deceased was lying on her right side.
It is true that the accused did not have any deep motive to kill the deceased.
It is obvious that he must have been upset by the persistent refusal of the brother and mother of the deceased to send her with him to his house.
He probably attributed the refusal to reluctance on the part of his wife to accompany him straightaway.
We may also refer here to the comment of the learned Counsel for the appellant that realizing that the motive would assume considerable importance if the case was one based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution tried to make P. W. 3 depose as if she had witnessed occurrence.
We do not think that the comment is justified.
P.W. 3, an old woman of 69 years, stated in her evidence that she saw the accused who was sitting by the side of the deceased on the cot make a gesture as if he was stabbing the deceased and that the deceased cried out 'Amma. ' In cross examination she stated that she did not remember if she had told the Police that the accused made a gesture as if he was stabbing the deceased.
The Inspector of Police P. W. 15, however, stated that P. W. 3 did not state before him that she saw the accused making a gesture as if he was stabbing the deceased.
We do not think that we will be justified in rejecting the evidence of all the prosecution witnesses on the basis of this statement of P. W. 3.
At the worst the so called improvement made by her may be rejected but no more.
We are unable to discover any good reason to reject the evidence of P. Ws. 1 to 3 or the evidence of P. Ws. 4 and 5.
We are afraid the learned Sessions Judge allowed himself to be assailed by airy and fanciful doubts.
We are satisfied that the High Court was justified in interfering with the order of acquittal.
The learned Counsel for the appellant advanced the usual argument submitted in all cases where an order of acquittal is reversed, namely, that where two views of the evidence are possible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt arising from the two views and that where the Trial Court has taken a possible view and acquitted the accused, the High Court should not interfere with the order of acquittal merely because another view is also possible.
The principles are now well settled.
At one time it was thou ht that an order of acquittal could be set aside for ""substantial and compelling reasons"" only and Courts used to launch on a search to discover those ""substantial and compelling reasons"".
However, the 'formulae ' of ""substantial and compelling reasons"", ""good and sufficiently cogent reasons"" and ""strong reasons"" and the search for them were abandoned as a result of the pronouncement of this Court in Sanwat Singh & Ors.
vs State of Rajasthan(1).
In Sanwat Singh 's case, this Court harked (1) A.l.
R. 369 back to the principles enunciated by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup vs Emperor(1) and re affirmed those principles.
After Sanwat Singh vs State of Rajasthan, this Court has consistently recognised the right of the Appellate Court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, bearing in mind the considerations mentioned by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup 's case.
Occasionally phrases like 'manifestly illegal ', grossly unjust ', have been used to describe the orders of acquittal which warrant interference.
But, such expressions have been used more, as flourishes of language, to emphasise the reluctance of the Appellate Court to interfere with an order of acquittal than to curtail the power of the Appellate Court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion.
In some cases Ramabhupala Reddy & Ors.
v The State of A.P.(2), Bhim Singh Rup Singh vs State of Maharashtra(3) it has been said that to the principles laid down in Sanwat Singh 's case may be added the further principle that ""if two reasonable conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record, the Appellate Court should not disturb the finding of the Trial Court"".
This, of course, is not a new principle.
It stems out of the fundamental principle, of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt.
If two reasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence are possible, one must necessarily concede the existence of a reasonable doubt.
But, fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account.
To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a doubt arising from the possibility of a duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him.
If the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt.
It is, therefore, essential that any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable. ""A reasonable doubt"", it has been remarked, ""does not mean some light, airy, insubstantial doubt that may flit through the minds of any of us about almost anything at some time or other, it does not mean a doubt begotten by sympathy out of reluctance to convict; it means a real doubt, a doubt founded upon reason""(4).
As observed by Lord Denning in Miller vs Minister of pensions(5) ""Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of a doubt.
(1) 61 I.A. 389.
(2) A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 460.
(3) A.l.
R. (4) Salmon J. in his charge to the jury in R. V. Fantle reported in (5) 370 The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice.
If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence 'of course it is possible but not in the least probable ' the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice"".
In Khem Karan & Ors.
vs State of U.P. & Anr.(1).
, this Court observed: ""Neither mere possibilities nor remote possibilities nor mere doubts which are not reasonable can, without danger to the administration of justice, be the foundation of the acquittal of an accused person, if there is otherwise fairly credible testimony"".
Where the Trial Court allows itself to be beset with fanciful doubts, rejects creditworthy evidence for slender reasons and takes a view of the evidence which is but barely possible, it is the obvious duty of the High Court to interfere in the interest of justice, lest the administration of justice be brought to ridicule.
That is what the High Court has done in this case.
The appeal is dismissed.
P. B. R. Appeal dismissed.
","The appellant was charged with the offence of committing the murder of his wife.
The trial court acquitted him on the ground that the prosecution had failed to establish any motive for the offence, that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was discrepant, conflicting and improbable and that when two views were possible on the basis of two divergent versions given by the prosecution and the defence, the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused.
The High Court reversed the order of acquittal and convicted and sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for life on the view that the trial court had magnified the importance to be attached to the discrepancies which were of a minor nature In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that in all cases where two views of the evidence were possible the accused was entitled to the benefit of doubt arising from the two views and that on this principle the High Court should not have interfered with the order of acquittal merely because another view was also possible.
Dismissing the appeal: ^ HELD : (1) Where the trial court allows itself to be beset with fanciful doubts, rejects creditworthy evidence for slender reasons and takes a view of the evidence which is but barely possible, it is the obvious duty of the High Court to interfere in the interest of justice, lest the administration of justice be brought to ridicule.
[370D] (2) After the decision of this Court in Sanwat Singh vs State of Rajasthan ; this Court has consistently recognised the right of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion bearing in mind the considerations mentioned by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup vs Emperor (61 T.A. 389).
Occasionally phrases like ""manifestly illegal"", ""grossly unjust have been used to describe the orders of acquittal which warrant interference.
But such expressions have been used more as flourishes of language to emphasise the reluctance of the appellate court to interfere with an order of acquittal than to curtail the power of the appellate court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion.
In two other cases it has been held that to the principles laid down in Sanwat Singh 's case may added the further principle that if two 364 reasonable conclusions could be reached on the basis of the evidence on record the appellate court should not disturb the finding of the trial court.
This principle stems out of the fundamental principle of our criminal jurisprudence that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt.
If two reasonably probable and evenly balanced views of the evidence are possible one must necessarily concede the existence of a reasonable doubt.
But fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account.
To entitle an accused person to the benefit of a doubt arising from the possibility of duality of views, the possible view in favour of the accused must be as nearly reasonably probable as that against him.
If the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt.
It is, therefore essential that, any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable.
A reasonable doubt does not mean some light, airy, insubstantial doubt that may flit through the mind of a Judge about almost anything at any time or other, it does not mean a doubt begotten by sympathy out of reluctance to convict, it means a real doubt, a doubt founded upon reason.
""Proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" does not mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice.
If the evidence is so strong against a man be to leave only a remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, ""of course it is possible but not in the least probable,"" the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt but nothing short of that will suffice.

Appeal from the judgment and decree dated July 27, 1959 of the Allahabad High Court in Income tax Reference No. 307 of 1957.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, J.
This appeal pursuant to a certificate granted by the Allahabad High Court under section 66A(2) of the Income tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) is directed against the judgment of the High Court in a reference under the Act, answering the question referred to it in the negative.
The question referred by the Appellate Tribunal is: ""Whether on a true interpretation of clause (viii) of subsection 3 of section 4 of the indian Income tax Act the sum of Rs. 36,396/ received by the assessee as an allowance during the previous year of the assessment year 1949 50 is revenue income liable to tax under the Indian Income tax Act, 1922?"" The relevant facts stated in the Statement of the case are as follows: The assessee is a Hindu undivided family headed by one Sri Trivikram Narain Singh who is a descendant of one Sri Babu Ausan Singh who was the original founder and owner of what is known as Ausanganj State in the district of Benaras.
The district of Benaras was formerly a part of Oudh territory.
By a Treaty between the East India Company Nawab Asfuddaula in or about the year 1775, the province of Benaras was ceded to the British Government.
The British Government granted a sanad of Raj to Raja Chet Singh who in turn gave the Jagir of Parganas Seyedpore and Bhittery in perpetuity to Babu Ausan Singh.
It appears that in 1796 there were some disputes between Babu Ausan Singh and the Zamindars in the district and the matter was referred by the Collector of Benaras to the Board of Revenue in Calcutta.
The disputes between the Jagirdars and Zamindars ultimately ended in 1837 by a compromise between the British Government and the then Jagirdar Hat Narain Singh whereby the British Government 702 granted a pension of Rs. 36,322/8/ to Babu Hat Narain Singh anal his heirs in perpetuity.
The quantum of this pension was calculated on the basis of 1/4th of the revenue of the Jagir.
By this arrangement the revenue or land collections of Jagir became payable by the Zamindars direct to the Government and by the grant of the pension, Babu Hat Narain Singh and his successors no longer remained the proprietors of the Parganas or the Jagir and became entitled to merely a pension.
The letter by which the amount of pension was determined at Rs. 36,322/8/ is dated 7th of July, 1837 and was from H. Elliot Esqr., the Secretary Sadar Board of Revenue N.W.P. Allahabad, to J. Thompson Esqr., Offg.
Secretary to Lt. Government, N.W.P."".
The pension was paid regularly from year to year by the Government to Babu Har Narain Singh and his heirs.
During the previous year of the assessment year 1949 50, the assessee received a sum of Rs. 36,396/ on account of the aforesaid pension.
The Income tax Officer, in spite of the objection of the assessee, held that it was a regular annual income of the assessee and did not fall within the category of agricultural income tax.
He observed that ""in fact this income arose from a statutory obligation of the Government to pay it, and although the Government recouped this from the person with whom the land was settled, land in the genealogical tree of Malikana appears in the second degree, its immediate and effective source is the Government 's statutory obligation to pay it, and this obligation is not land within the meaning of Income tax Act, vide C.I.T.v.
Raja Bahadur Karnakhaya Harain Singh(1)"".
The assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who held that ""the alleged cash grant of varying and unspecified amount received by the appellant, in relation to land revenue of Seyedpur now Tehsil of District Ghazipur, clearly fell within the definition of agricultural income under Section 2(1) of the Incometax Act."" The Income tax Officer appealed to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal.
The Tribunal held that the sum of Rs. 36,396/ was chargeable to tax under the Act as the income was not agricultural income for ""although the pension was determined with respect to the quantum of the rent collection the rent collections or the land could not be said to be the immediate source of the pension.
The source of the pension was a liability undertaken by the Government for extinguishing the proprietary rights of the Jagirdar and when the immediate source of the income was not land or rent collections from land, it is difficult to hold that the receipt of the assessee was agricultural income within the meaning of Section 4(3)(viii) of the Income tax Act.
"" The High Court held that from the language of the letter of July 7, 1837, it was manifest that the right which was conferred 703 was a right to a share of one fourth in the net land revenue collections after deducting costs of Tahsil establishment.
It relied on the fact that the amount which had been received by the successors of Babu Harnarain Singh varied from year to year.
It observed that ""the language of the letter and this conduct of the parties can only lead to the inference that, by this settlement contained in the letter of 7th July, 1837, Babu Har Narain Singh and his successors were granted in perpetuity a right to one fourth of the land revenue collections themselves and not merely a right to receive u sum of money calculated on that basis."" The High Court accordingly answered the question in the negative.
The learned Additional Solicitor General, on behalf of the appellant, contends that according to the true interpretation of the letter dated July 7, 1837, no right in the land revenue was granted to the assessee.
He relies on the decision of this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh vs Kunwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh(1).
That case arose out of the writ petition filed by the present respondent in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad for a writ in the nature of mandamus calling upon the State of Uttar Pradesh to forbear from interfering with his right to regular payment of the ""pension, allowance or Malikana"" payable in lieu of the hereditary estate of Harnarain Singh in respect of parganas ""Syudpore Bhettree"" and for an order for payment of the ""pension, allowance or malikana"" as it fell due.
This Court interpreted the same letter, dated July 7, 1837, and came to the conclusion that the respondent did not acquire any interest in land or any land revenue.
Shah, J., speaking for the Court, observed: ""Because the annual allowance is equal to a fourth share of the net revenue of the mahals, the right of the respondent does not acquire the character of an interest in land or in land revenue.
Under the arrangement, the entire land revenue was to be collected by the Government and in the collection Harnarain Singh and his descendants had no interest or obligation.
As a consideration for relinquishing the right to the land and the revenue thereof, the respondent and his ancestors were given an allowance of Rs. 30,612 13 0.
The allowance was in a sense related to the land revenue assessed on the land, i.e. it was fixed as a percentage of the land revenue; but the percentage was merely a measure, and indicated the source of the right in lieu of which the allowance was given.
"" The learned counsel for the respondent, Mr. A. Viswanatha Sastri urges that on its true interpretation the letter dated July 7, 1837, showed an arrangement for sharing collections.
We are unable to agree with his contention.
We respectfully adopt the reasoning and conclusion of this Court in the case of State of ; 704 Uttar Pradesh vs Kunwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh(1) and hold that the respondent, under the arrangement, had no interest in land or in the land revenue payable in respect thereof.
If this is the true interpretation of the arrangement arrived at, the question arises whether the pension or allowance is agricultural income. 'Agricultural income ' is defined in section 2 of the Act as follows: ""(1) ""agricultural income"" means (a) any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes and is either assessed to land revenue in British India or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of the Crown as such: . "" In Maharajkumar Gopal Saran Narain Singh vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar and Orissa(2), the facts were that the assessee had conveyed the greater portion of his estate.
The consideration for the transfer was, inter alia, an annual payment of Rs. 2,40,000/to the assessee for life.
The Privy Council held that this ""annual payment was not agricultural income as it was not rent or revenue derived from land but money payable under a contract imposing a personal liability on the covenantor the discharge of which was secured by a charge on land."" The Privy Council, in Commissioner of Income tax Bihar and vs Raja Bahadur Kamakhaya Narayan Singh and construed the word 'derived ' as :follows: ""The word ""derived"" is not a term of article Its use in the definition indeed demands an enquiry into the genealogy of the product.
But the enquiry should stop as soon as the effective source is discovered.
In the genealogical tree of the interest land indeed appears in the second degree, but the immediate and effective source is rent, which has suffered the accident of nonpayment.
And rent is not land within the meaning of the definition."" This Court observed in Mrs. Bacha F. Guzdar, Bombay Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay(4) as follow: ""Agricultural income as defined in the Act is intended to refer to the revenue received by direct association with the land which is used for agricultural purposes and not by indirectly extending it to cases where that revenue or part thereof changes hands either by way of distribution of dividends or otherwise."" (1) ; (2) (3) 16 I.T.R.325 (4) 705 The same test was adopted by this Court in Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar and Orissa(1) and the Court again looked to the source of the right in order to determine whether income was agricultural income or not.
Shah, J., observed: ""The appellant has no beneficial interest in the lands which are the subject matter of the trust: nor is he given under the trust a right to receive and appropriate to himself the income of the properties or a part thereof in lieu of any beneficial interest in that income.
The source of the right in which a fraction of the net income of the trust is to be appropriated by the appellant as his remuneration is not in the right to receive rent or revenue of agricultural lands, but rests in the covenant in the deed to receive remuneration for management of the trust.
The income of the trust appropriated by the appellant as remuneration is not received by him as rent or revenue of land; the character of the income appropriated as remuneration due is again not the same as the character in which it was received by the appellant as trustee.
Both the source and character of the income are, therefore, altered when a part of the income of the trust is appropriated by the appellant as his remuneration, and that is so, notwithstanding that computation of remuneration is made as a percentage of the income, a substantial part whereof is derived from lands used for agricultural purposes.
The remuneration not being received as rent or revenue of agricultural lands under a title, legal or beneficial in the property from which the income is received, it is not income exempt under section 4(3)(viii).
"" It follows from the decisions of the Privy Council and the judgments of this Court cited above that if it is held in this case that the source of the allowance or pension is the arrangement arrived at in 1837.
then the income cannot be held to be derived from land within the meaning of the definition in section 2(1)(a) of the Act.
It seems to us that in this case the source of income is clearly the arrangement arrived at in 1837 and, therefore, it is not agricultural income as defined in the Act.
Mr. Sastri sought to distinguish those cases on the ground that the allowance here varied from year to year.
Assuming that the allowance varied from year to year, the source of the income still remains the arrangement and not land.
The next point that arises in this case is whether the allowance is taxable income at all.
Mr. Sastri contends that it is capital receipt.
He says that if the assessee 's predecessor had received ) 706 compensation for relinquishing his title to the lands in dispute, that would have been a capital receipt and not taxable.
He further says that the allowance was in fact a payment of the compensation for relinquishing the title to those lands.
He says that we must consider the quality of the income and not its periodicity.
He refers to the following passage from the speech of Viscount Simon in Commissioner of Inland Revenue vs Wesleyan and General Assurance Society(1): ""It may be well to repeat two propositions which are well established in the application of the law relating to Income tax.
First, the name given to a transaction by the parties concerned does not necessarily decide the nature of the transaction.
To call a payment a loan if it is really an annuity does not assist the taxpayer, any more than to call an item a capital payment would prevent it from being regarded as an income payment if that is its true nature.
The question always is what is the real character of the payment, not what the parties call it.
"" He, therefore, asked us to disregard the word 'pension ' in the letter dated July 7, 1837, and determine the real character of the payment.
Another passage from the speech of Viscount Simon is also relevant.
Lord Simon observed: ""Secondly, a transaction which, on its true construction, is of a kind that would escape tax, is not taxable on the ground that the same result could be brought about by a transaction in another form which would attract tax.
As the Master of the Rolls said in the present case: 'In dealing with Income tax questions it frequently happens that there are two methods at least of achieving a particular financial result.
If one of those methods is adopted tax will be payable.
If the other method is adopted, tax will not be payable .
The net result from the financial point of view is precisely the same in each case, but one method of achieving it attracts tax and the other method does not.
There have been cases in the past where what has been called the substance of the transaction has been thought to enable the Court to construe a document in such a way as to attract tax.
That particular doctrine of substance as distinct from form was, I hope, finally exploded by the decision of the House of Lords in the case of Duke of Westminster vs Commissioner of Inland Revenue(2)"".
It seems to us that where an owner of an estate exchanges a capital asset for a perpetual annuity, it is ordinarily taxable income in his hands.
The position will be different if he exchanges (1) 30 T.C. II.
(2) 707 his estate for a capital sum payable in installments.
The installments when received would not be taxable income.
Mr. Sastri, relying on Perrin vs Dickson(1) contends that an annuity is not always taxable as income.
This is true, but in this case no material has been produced to show that the allowance was in fact a payment in instalments of the value of the disputed title of the assessee 's predecessor in 1837.
In the result, we hold that the allowance is revenue income and not exempt from taxation as agricultural income.
Therefore, we accept the appeal and answer the question referred in the affirmative.
The appellant will have his costs here and in the High court.
Appeal allowed.
","The respondent was the head of a Hindu undivided family and was the descendant of a Jagirdar.
Certain disputes between the Jagirdar and the Zamindars in the district had been settled in 1837 by a compromise between the British Government and the then Jagirdar, whereby, the Government granted the Jagirdar and his heirs a pension in perpetuity to be calculated on the basis of one fourth of the revenue of the Jagir.
By this arrangement the collections from the Jagir became payable by the Zamindars direct to the Government and the Jagirdar and his successors no longer remained the proprietors of the Jagir and became entitled only to a pension.
The Income tax Officer assessed the receipt of the pension by the respondent as part of his regular income and rejected the latter 's contention that the amount received was agricultural income within the meaning of section 4(3)(viii) of the Income tax Act, 1922.
In appeal, the Assistant Commissioner accepted the respondent 's contention, but the Tribunal reversed this finding.
The High Court, on a reference, decided the issue in favour of the respondent, on the grounds, inter alia, that the right conferred under the compromise of 1837 was a right to a share of one fourth in the net land revenue collections and furthermore, the amount received by the successors of the Jagirdar varied from year to year.
In the appeal before the Supreme Court, it was also contended on behalf of the respondent that the amount received was in the nature of a capital receipt, being a payment to the Jagirdar and his successors of compensation for relinquishing the title to the Jagir lands.
HELD: (i) Under the compromise and arrangement of 1837, the respondent had no interest in the land or in the land revenue payable in respect thereof.
[704 A] State of U.P.v.

As the source of the income in this case was the arrangement of 1837, the income could not be held to be derived from land within the meaning of the definition of agricultural income in section 2(1)(a) of the Act.
Even if the income varied from year to year, the source of the income was still the arrangement and not land.

Such installments when received would not be taxable as income.

2593,"Appeal No. 647 of 1966.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated June 19, 24, 1963 of the Gujarat High Court in Appeal No. 704 of 1960 from Appellate Decree.
P. K. Chatterjee and section P. Nayar, for the appellant.
I. N. Shroff, for respondent No. 1.
section K. Dholakia and Vineet Kumar, for respondent No. 2.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, J.
This appeal by special leave arises out of the suit filed by Bhaishankar Avalram Joshi, hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff, for a declaration that the order of dismissal, dated February 2/4, 1955, passed by the Inspector General of Prisons, Saurashtra, was illegal and void on the ground that it contravened the provisions of article 311 (2) of the Constitution.
The plaintiff also prayed for a decree for Rs. 2,690 being arrears of his pay from April 1, 1954 to May 7, 1956.
The plaintiff failed before the Civil Judge, Rajkot, but on appeal succeeded before the District Judge, Central Saurashtra, inasmuch as he declared order dated February 2/4, 1955, illegal and void.
The plaintiff appealed to the High Court claiming arrears of salary and the State of Bombay filed cross objections praying that the suit be dismissed.
The second appeal was heard by the High Court of Gujarat (Miabhoy, J.) who directed that the decree passed by the lower appellate court ""be varied so as to show that the appellant (plaintiff) continued to be in Government service till the date of the suit only and there will be a decree for Rs. 2,690 919 being arrears of pay due to the appellant (plaintiff) upto the date of the suit.
There will be a further provision in the decree that the liability arising out of the declaration that the appellant is in Government service is the liability of the State of Gujarat and that the liability for the payment of the arrears of pay is the liability of the State of Maharashtra"".
The State of Maharashtra filed as application for leave to appeal under the Letters Patent but this ' was dismissed.
The appeal is now before us.
The learned counsel for the appellant the state of Maharashtra , contends ,first, that the High Court erred in holding that there had been a breach of article 311(2) of the Constitution, as, according to him, there was no duty to supply a copy of the report of the enquiry held against the plaintiff.
Secondly, he contends that the High Court erred in fastening the liability in respect of the arrears of pay on the State of Maharashtra.
Before we deal with the above points we may give a few facts.
The plaintiff entered service in the Gondal State in 1927 as a jailor.
The Gondal State merged with the United States of Saurashtra.
On March 6, 1953, the plaintiff was appointed senior jailor, Surendranagar District Jail.
On March 25, 1954, he was suspended, and at that time he was acting as Accountant at Rajkot Central Jail.
On March 7, 1954, he was served with a charge sheet.
In substance the charges were that while he was serving at Surendranagar he had committed certain acts of mis appropriation of food stuffs meant for prisoners, maltreatment of prisoners and acceptance of illegal gratification from them.
The plaintiff filed a written statement on September 4, 1954, and an enquiry was held by Mr. Gangopadhyay.
The plaintiff appeared before that officer and cross examined witnesses.
He also examined himself and some witnesses.
He was also allowed to appear through an Advocate in the enquiry proceedings.
The Enquiry Officer made a report and on or about January 7, 1955, the following notice was issued to him calling upon him to show cause why he should not be dismissed from service ""To Shri Bhaishanker A. Joshi, Accountant, Rajkot Central Prison (Under suspension) Charges framed against you under this office No. C/ 14 dated 27 3 54 and in particular the charges of having accepted illegal gratification from prisoner Ratilal Jivan have been established to the satisfaction of Government.
You are hereby asked to show cause why the punishment of dismissal from service should not be inflicted upon You.
920 You should please submit your reply to this office, through the Superintendent, Rajkot Central Prison,, within a week from the date of receipt of this letter without fail.
Sd/ M. J. BHATT Inspector General of Prisons, Government of Saurashtra.
"" The plaintiff filed a written statement.
He was dismissed by the Inspector General of Prisons by his order dated February 2/4, 1955.
This order was amended on February 9, 1955, in which it was stated that ""the aforesaid order should be read so as to show that the plaintiff was dismissed from service on account of charge of accepting, illegal gratification from prisoner Ratilal Jivan having been conclusively proved against him in the departmental inquiries conducted against him by the Government"".
In the plaint the plaintiff alleged that copy of the enquiry report was never supplied to him, and consequently he had not been given reasonable opportunity within the meaning of article 311 of the Constitution.
The State of Bombay admitted that the plaintiff was not supplied with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer, but pleaded that the plaintiff had not asked for copy of the report and had not been prejudiced by the non supply of the copy of the report.
The High Court held that the failure on the part of the competent authority to provide the plaintiff with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer amounted to denial of reasonable opportunity contemplated by article 311(2) of the Constitution.
It seems to us that the High Court came to a correct conclu sion.
The plaintiff was not aware whether the Enquiry Officer reported in his favour or against him.
If the report was in his favour, in his representation to the Government he would have utilised its reasoning to dissuade the Inspector General from coming to a contrary conclusion, and if the report was against him he would have put such arguments or material as he could to dissuade the Inspector General from accepting the report of the Enquiry Officer.
Moreover, as pointed out by the High Court, the Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him, and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped is not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons.
921 As observed by Gajendragadkar, J., as he then was, in Union of lndia vs H. C. Goel(1), ""the enquiry report along with the evidence recorded constitute the material on which the Government has ultimately to act.
That is the only purpose of the enquiry held by competent officer and the report he makes as a result of the said enquiry"".
It is true that the question whether reasonable opportunity has or has not been afforded to the Government servant must depend on the facts of each case, but it would be in very rare cases indeed in which it could be said that the Government servant is not prejudiced by the non supply of the report of the Enquiry Officer.
In the result we must over rule the first contention urged on behalf of the appellant, the State of Maharashtra.
The plaintiff is not concerned with the second contention but it is a dispute between the State of Maharashtra and the State of Gujarat.
As is well known, the State of Bombay was reorganised into the above two States and the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960, contained various provisions for the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the two States.
We are here concerned with sections 60 and 61 of the Bombay Reorganisation 1960, which read thus : ""60.
(1) Where, before the appointed day, the State of Bombay has made any contract in the exercise of its executive power for any purposes of the State, that contract shall be deemed to have been made in the exercise of the executive power, ( a) if such purposes are, as from that day, exclusively purposes of either the State of Maharashtra or the State of Gujarat, of that State; and (b) in any other case, of the State of Maharashtra; and all rights and liabilities which have accrued, or may accrue, under any such contract shall, to the extent to which they would have been rights or liabilities of the State of Bombay, be rights or liabilities of the State of Maharashtra or the State of Gujarat, as the case may be; Provided that in any such case as is referred to in clause (b), the initial allocation of 'rights and liabilities made by this sub section shall be subject to such financial adjustment as may be agreed upon between the State (1) ; ,728.
922 of Maharashtra and the State of Gujarat, or, in default of such agreement, as the Central Government may by order direct.
(2) For the purposes of this section there shall be deemed to be included in the liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under any contract (a)any liability to satisfy an order or award made by any court or other tribunal in proceedings relating to the contract; and (b any liability in respect of expenses incurred in or in connection with any such proceedings.
(3)This section shall have effect subject to the other provisions of this Part relating to the apportionment of liabilities in respect of loans, guarantees and other financial obligations; and bank balances and securities shall, notwithstanding that they partake of the nature of contractual rights, be dealt with under those provisions.
Where, immediately before the appointed day, the State of Bombay is subject to any liability in respect of any actionable wrong other than breach of contract, that liability shall, (a) if the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the State of Maharashtra or the State of Gujarat, be a liability of that State; and (b) in any other case, be initially a liability of the State of Maharashtra but subject to such financial adjustment as may be agreed upon between the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat or, in default of such agreement, as the Central Government may by order direct."" The learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra contends that the liability to pay arrears of pay was not a liability arising out of a contract but was a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a. breach of contract.
This Court in State of Bihar vs Abdul Majid(1) held ""that the rule of English Law that a civil servant cannot maintain a suit against the Crown for the recovery of arrears of salary does not prevail in India and it has been negatived by the provisions of the statute law in India"".
Mahajan, C.J., speaking for the Court, observed at p. 802: ""As regard torts of its servants in exercise of sovereign powers, the company was not, and the Crown in (1) ; 923 India was not, liable unless the act has been ordered or ratified by it.
Be that as it may, that rule has no application to the case of arrears of salary earned by a public servant for the period that he was actually in office.
The present claim is not based on tort but is based on quantum meruit or contract and the court is entitled to give relief to him.
"" It may be that these observations are not conclusive on the point under consideration.
It seems to us, however, that some elements of relationship between a public servant and Government are based on contract within the meaning of section 60 of the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960.
In particular, the liability to pay salary, when it has been fixed, arises out of a contract to pay salary.
Authority is not lacking even in England where a special relationship exists between the Crown and its public servants.
In Owner or section section Raphael v, Brandy(1) the head note reads A stoker on board a merchant ship, who was en titled to wages from the shipowners, and also as a stoker in the Royal Naval Reserve to 6 pound a year as a retainer, was injured by an accident on the ship which disabled him from continuing to serve in the Royal Naval Reserve Held, that the stoker was entitled under the Workmen 's Compensation Act, 1906, to compensation from the shipowners not only in respect of his wages but also of the retainer, which must be taken into account as earnings under a concurrent contract of service.
"" The Lord Chancellor in the course of the speech observed ""A point was made before your Lordships which does not appear to have been made in the Court below, that there was no contract with the Crown at all here.
The authorities cited_go no further than to say that when there is an engagement between the Crown and a military or naval officer the Crown is always entitled to determine it at pleasure, and that no obligation contrary to that would be recognized or valid in law.
It was then said that there were not here concurrent contracts.
I agree with Fletcher Moulton L.J. that this is almost a typical case of concurrent contracts, because the workman was being paid wages for his services on board a merchant ship, and at the same time he was earning his 6 pound a year by virtue of his engagement with the Crown; and he was giving an equivalent for that, (1) 924 because he was keeping himself fit and doing the work which he stipulated to do.
"" It is true that Lord Goddard, C.J., in Inland Revenue Commissioners vs
Hambrook(1) observed : ""If I may be bold enough to express a conclusion on a matter on which the Judicial Committee hesitated in Reilly vs R (2) , it is that an established civil servant is appointed to an office and is a public officer, remune rated by moneys provided by Parliament, so that his employment depends not on a contract with the Crown but on appointment by the Crown, though there may be as indicated in Reilly vs R. (2) exceptional cases, as for instance an engagement for a definite period where there is a contractual element in or collateral to his employment."" But in the Court of Appeal nothing was said about these observations.
It will be remembered that the Privy Council had said in Reilly vs R(2) that ""their Lordships are not prepared to accede to this view of the contract, if contract there be.
If the terms of the appointment definitely prescribe a term and expressly provide for a power to determine ""for cause"" it appears necessarily to follow that any implication of a power to dismiss at pleasure is excluded.
"" Even Lord Goddard, C.J., in Terrell vs Secretary of State for the Colonies(3) observed that ""the case (Reilly vs R.) (2) shows that there may be contractual rights existing before determination of a contract at will which are not inconsistent with a power to determine,"" and he stuck to this in Hambrook 's case(1) by stating : ""Although it is clear that no action for wrongful dismissal can 'be brought by a discharged civil servant, I may be allowed to say that I adhere to the opinion which I expressed in Terrell vs Secretary of State for the Colonies(1) that he could recover his salary for the time during which he has served.
He would claim on a quantum mersuit and I am fortified in this view by Reilly vs R. (2), by R. vs Doultre(4) and by Bushe vs R(5) referred to in Robertson 's book at p, 338."" (1)[1956] 1 All E.R. 807, 811 12.
(2) ; 179.
(3) [1953] 2Q.B.482,499.
(4) (5) (May 29, We are here concerned with a choice between section 60 and section 61, which lay down two broad categories.
It seems to us that the decree of the High Court decreeing payment of arrears of salary is truly a liability in proceedings relating to a contract within section 60(2)(a) of the Act.
It is true, as held by this Court in the State of Tripura vs The Province of East Bengal(1), that the words ,actionable wrong other than breach of contract ' in this context are wide words and include something more than torts, but even so where a suit is brought by a Government servant for arrears of salary, the decree more properly falls under section 60 of the Act rather than under section 61.
In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs to the respondent, Baishankar Avalram Joshi.
The State ' of Gujarat will bear its own costs in this appeal.
R.K.P.S. Appeal dismissed.
","The first respondent while he was holding the post of a Senior Jailor in March, 1954, was suspended on the allegations that he had committed certain acts of misappropriation and maltreatment of prisoners.
After January, 1955.
A show cause notice was then issued to him to which he replied by a written statement.
The respondent was dismissed by an order of Inspector General of Prisons in February, 1955.
The respondent filed a suit for a declaration that enquiry report was never supplied to him and consequently he had not been given reasonable opportunity within the meaning of article 311 of the Constitution.
He also prayed for a decree for arrears of pay from April, 1954 to May, 1960.
His suit was dismissed by the trial court but he succeeded in the first appeal where the order of dismissal was declared illegal and void.
An appeal by the respondent to the High Court claiming arrears of salary was allowed.
As the State of Bombay had, in the meantime, been reorganised, the High Court also directed that the liability for arrears of salary upto the date of suit would be that of the State of Maharashtra and the liability arising out of the declaration that the appellant was in Government service would be the liability of the State of Gujarat.
A Letters Patent appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra was dismissed.
In appeal to this Court, it was contended, inter alia, on behalf of the appellant that the liability to pay arrears of pay was not a liability arising out of a contract within the meaning of section 60 of the Bombay Reorganisation Act of 1960 but it was a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract within the meaning of section 61 of the Act.
HELD: (1) The High Court had rightly found that the failure on the part of the competent authority to provide the respondent with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer amounted to denial of reasonable opportunity contemplated by article 311(2) of the Constitution.
The Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped in not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons.
[920 F] Union of India vs H. C. Goel, ; , 728, referred to.
It is true that the question whether reasonable opportunity has or has not been ' afforded to the Government servant must depend on the facts 918 of each case, but it would be in very rare cases indeed in which it could be said that the Government servant is not prejudiced by the non supply of the report of the Enquiry officer.
[921 B] (2) The decree of the High Court decreeing payment of arrears of salary is truly a liability in proceedings relating to a contract within section 60(2) (a) of the Act.
Although the words 'actionable wrong ' other than breach of contract in this context are wide words and include something more than torts, but even so where a suit is brought by a Government servant for arrears of salary the decree more properly falls under section 60 of the Act rather than under a. 61.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Shah, J.
By insistence upon procedural wrangling in a com paratively simple suit pending in the Court of Small Causes at Ahmedabad the parties have effectively prevented all progress in the suit during the last six years.
A building in the town of Ahmedabad used as a cinematograph theatre belonged originally to Messrs. Popatlal Punjabhai.
estate of the owners and on August 19, 1954, the receivers ,estate of the owners and on August 19, 1954, The receivers granted a lease of the theatre on certain terms and conditions to two persons, Raval and Faraqui.
By an agreement dated November 27, 1954, between Raval and Faraqui on the one hand and Messrs. Filmistan Distributors (India) Private Ltd. hereinafter called ""Filmistan on the other hand, right to exhibit cinematograph films was granted to the latter on certain terms and conditions.
""Filmistan"" instituted suit No. 149 of 1960 in the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division) at Ahmedabad against Raval and Faraqui and two other persons claiming a declaration that it 437 was entitled pursuant to the agreement dated November 27, 1954, to exhibit motion pictures in the theatre.
By an order dated December 1, 1960 the suit was disposed of as compromised.
It was inter alia agreed that Raval and Faraqui were bound and liable to allow Filmistan to exercise its ""exhibition rights"" in the theatre; that Raval and Faraqui, their servants and agents were not to have any right to exhibit any picture in contravention of the terms and conditions of the agreement dated November 27, 1954; and that Raval and Faraqui shall ""execute and register"" an agreement in writing incorporating the said agreement with the variation as to rental.
Pursuant to this agreement, a fresh agreement was executed on December 1, 1960.
On September 1, 1963, Filmistan filed suit No. 1465 of 1963 in the Court of Small Causes at Ahmedabad, inter alia, for a declaration that as sub lessee or as lessee under law it was entitled to obtain and remain in possession of the theatre and to exhibit cinematograph films and to hold ""entertainment performances"" etc.
in the theatre, and that one Shabeer Hussain Khan Tejabwala had no right, title or interest in the theatre, that the defendants in the suit be ordered to hand over vacant and peaceful possession of the theatre, and the defendants, their servants and agents be restrained by an injunction from interfering directly or indirectly with its rights to obtain and remain in possession of the theatre or any part thereof and to exercise its right of exhibiting ""motion pictures"" and entertainment performances etc.
This suit was filed against the receivers in insolvency of the owners of the theatre, against Raval and Faraqui, against Tejabwala and also against Baldevdas Shivlal who claimed to be the owner of the theatre.
The suit was based on the claim by Filmistan as lessees or sub lessees of the theatre and was exclusively triable by the Court of Small Causes by virtue of section 28 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947.
Three sets of written statements were filed against the claim made by Filmistan, but no reference need be made thereto, since at this stage in deciding appeal the merits of the pleas raised by the defendants are not relevant.
After issues were raised on June 20, 1966, the plaint was amended and additional written statements were filed by the Defendants.
The learned Judge was then requested to frame three additional issues in view of the amended pleadings : the issues were: 1.
Whether in view of the said consent decree in suit No. 149 of 1960 defendants Nos. 5 and 6 are debarred on principles of res judicata from agitating the question that the said document dated November 27, 1954 as confirmed by their letter dated January 31, L13 Sup.
CI/69 17 438 1955 and further confirmed by document dated December 1, 1960 is not a lease? 12.
Whether in view of the said consent decree, defendants 5 and 6 are estopped from contending and leading any evidence and putting questions in crossexamination of plaintiffs witnesses to show that the said document dated November 27, 1954 as confirmed by their letter dated January 31, 1955 and further confirmed by document dated December 1, 1960 is not a lease ? 13.
Whether in respect of the terms of the said consent decree as also of the said document dated November 27, 1954, as confirmed by their letter dated January 31, 1955 and further confirmed by document dated December 1, 1960 defendants Nos. 5 and 6 are debarred from leading any evidence of the, plaintiffs witnesses in view of section 92 of the Evidence Act ?"" In drawing up the additional issues not much care was apparently exercised : whether a party is entitled to lead evidence or to put questions in cross examination of the plaintiff 's witnesses cannot form the subject matter of an issue.
Filmistan then applied to the Court of Small Causes for an order that issues Nos. 11, 12 & 13 be tried as preliminary issues.
The learned Judge observed that the issues were not purely of law, that in any event the case or any part thereof was not likely to be disposed of on these issues, and that ordinarily in ""appealable cases"" the Court should, as far as possible, decide all the issues together and that piecemeal trial might result in protracting the litigation.
He also observed that the issues were not of law going to the root of the case and were on that account not capable of being decided without recording evidence.
A revision application against that order was dismissed in limine by the High Court of Gujarat.
When the case reached hearing and the evidence of a representative of Filmistan was.
being recorded, counsel for the defendants asked in cross examination the question whether the ""agreement between the plaintiff and defendant Nos. 5 and 6 was a commercial transaction and was not a lease ?"" The question was objected to by counsel appearing for Filmistan.
Thereafter elaborate arguments were advanced and the Trial Judge passed an order disallowing the objection.
The objection to the question raised by Filmistan was not that it related to a matter to be decided by the Court and on which the opinion of witnesses was irrelevant.
The objection was raised as 439 an attempt to reopen the previous decision given by the Trial Judge refusing to try issues Nos. 11, 12 & 13 as preliminary issues.
Counsel for Filmistan contended that an enquiry into the nature of the legal relationship arising out of the agreement dated December 1, 1960 ""was barred by the principle of res judicata and estoppel under the provisions of section 92 of the Evidence Act"", since the question was already concluded by the consent decree in suit No. 149 of 1960.
The Trial Judge observed that he had carefully gone through the consent decree and the registered agreement dated December 1, 1960, and he found that the consent decree had not decided that the transaction between the parties of the year 1954 was in the nature of a lease; that in the plaint in the earlier suit it was not even averred that the rights granted were in the nature of leasehold rights; that suit No. 149 of 1960 was for declaration of the rights of Filmistan to exhibit motion pictures, in the theatre under the agreement dated November 27, 1954, and for an injunction restraining the defendants from violating the said rights of Filmistan under the agreement; and that the agreement dated December 1, 1960 was ""not plain enough to exclude the oral evidence of the surrounding circumstances and conduct of the parties to explain its terms and language"".
Accordingly he held that the question asked in cross examination of the witnesses for Filmistan intended to secure disclosure of the surrounding circumstances and conduct of the parties in order to show in what manner the language of the document was related to the existing facts, could not be excluded.
The Court also rejected the contention that there was any bar of estoppel, and held that evidence as to the true nature of the transaction was not inadmissible by virtue of section 92 of the Evidence Act.
Filmistan feeling dissatisfied with the order invoked the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court of Gujarat under section 115 of ' the Code of Civil Procedure.
The revision petition was entertained and elaborate arguments were advanced at the Bar.
The High Court referred to a number of authorities and observed that the correctness of the findings of the Trial Court on issues Nos. 12 and 13 may not be examined in exercise of the powers under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The Court proceeded to, observe : ""The question then arises for consideration whether in fact the subordinate Court has decided the question of res judicata"", and that ""it is true that the jurisdiction of the Court of mall Causes to decide disputes between a tenant and his landlord and falling within the purview of section 28 of the Bombay Rent Control Act is derived from section 28 of the said Act, but at the same time if an issue is in fact barred by res judicata, then the Court has no 440 jurisdiction on principles of res judicata to go into that question or to decide that question over again to the extent to which the Court, viz., the trial court in the instant case, proposed to go into that question and allow the whole question, that was closed once for all by consent decree of December 1, 1960, to be reopened, it is proposing to exercise the jurisdiction which is not vested in it by law.
It is not open to any Court of law to try an issue over again or reopen the same if an earlier decision operates as res judicata.
Once the jurisdiction of the Court has been taken away, any proposal to reopen the question closed by the earlier decision would be exercise of jurisdiction which is not vested in the Court by law and to that extent the decision would become revisable, even if it is the decision as to the res judicata of an issue"", and concluded ""It is not open to me in revision at this stage to express any opinion about the rights and contentions of the parties with reference to the agreement of December 1, 1960.
But the only thing that can be said is that so far as the agreement of November 27, 1954, is con cerned, it must be held, in view of the consent decree of December 1, 1960, that that document of November 27, 1954, created a lease. .
The consent decree must be held to create a bar of res judicata as far as the question of document of November 27, 1954, creatin g a lease is, concerned.
The learned Judge will not proceed with the trial"".
By section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure the High Court is invested with power to call for the record of any case decided by any Court subordinate to such High Court and in which no appeal lies thereo, if such subordinate court appears (a) to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or (b) to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or (c) to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity, and to make such order in the case as it thinks fit.
Exercise of the power is broadly subject to three important conditions (1) that the decision is of a Court subordinate to the High Court; (2) that there is a case which has been decided by the subordinate Court; and (3) that the subordinate Court has exercised jurisdiction not vested in it by law or to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or to have acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.
441 In the present case the Court of Small Causes had only decided that a question seeking information about the true legal relationship arising out of the document could be permitted to 'be put to the witnesses for Filmistan.
The Court gave no finding expressly or by implication on the issue of res judicata or any other issue.
In the view of the Trial Court the question whether the legal relationship arising out of the agreement dated December 1, 1960 was in the nature of a lease or of other character had to be decided at the trial and the previous judgment being a judgment by consent , 'could not operate as res judicata"", for, it was not a decision of the Court, and that the consent decree in suit No. 149 of 1960 had not decided that the agreement dated March 27, 1954, was of the nature of a lease, and that in the plaint in that suit it was not even averred that it was a lease.
The Trial Judge in overruling the objection did not decide any issues at the stage of recording evidence : he was not called upon to decide any issues at that stage.
The observations made by him obviously relate to the arguments advanced at the Bar and can in no sense be regarded even indirectly as a decision on any of the issues.
But the High Court has recorded a finding that the agreement dated November 27, 1954, created a lease and that the consent decree operated as res judicata.
A consent decree, accord ing to the decisions of this Court, does not operate as res judicata, because a consent decree is merely the record of a contract between the parties to a suit, to which is superadded the seal of the Court.
A matter in contest in a suit may operate as res judicata only if there is an adjudication by the Court : the terms of section II of the Code leave no scope for a contrary view.
Again it was for the Trial Court in the first instance to decide that question and there after the High Court could, if the matter were brought before it by way of appeal or in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, have decided that question.
In our judgment, the High Court had no jurisdiction to record any finding on the issue of res judicata in a revision application filed against an order refusing to uphold an objection to certain question asked to a witness under examination.
The true nature of the order brought before the High Court and the dimensions of the dispute covered thereby apparently got blurred and the High Court proceeded to decide matters on which no decision was till then recorded by the Trial Court, and which could not be decided by the High Court until the parties had opportunity to lead evidence thereon.
It may also be observed that by ordering that a question may properly to put to a witness who was being examined, no case was decided by the Trial Court.
The expression ""case"" is not limited in its import to the entirety of the matter in dispute in an action.
442 This Court observed in Major section section Khanna vs Brig.
F. J. Dillon(1) that the expression ""case"" is a word of comprehensive import : it includes a civil proceeding and is not restricted by anything contained in section 115 of the Code to the entirety of the proceeding in a civil court.
To interpret the expression ""case"" as an entire proceeding only and not a part of the proceeding imposes an unwarranted restriction on the exercise of powers of superintendence and may result in certain cases in denying relief to the aggrieved litigant where it is most needed and may result in the perpetration of gross injustice.
But it was not decided in Major section section Khanna 's case(1) that every order of the Court in the course of a suit amounts to a case decided.
A case may be said to be decided, if the Court adjudicates for the purposes of the suit some right or obligation of the parties in controversy; every order in the suit cannot be regarded as a case decided within the meaning of section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The order passed by the High Court is set aside and the Trial Court is directed to proceed and dispose of the suit.
We trust that the suit will be taken up early for hearing and disposed of expeditiously.
We recommend that the form of the issues Nos. 11, 12 and 13 will be rectified by the learned Trial Judge.
Filmistan will pay the costs of the appeal in this Court and in the High Court.
G.C. Appeal allowed.
","R and F who held a cinema building in Ahmedabad on lease entered on November 27, 1954 into an agreement with respondent No. 1 giving the latter a right to exhibit cinematograph films in the said building.
Later respondent No. 1 filed 'suit No. 149 of 1960 to assert his right to exhibit films in the building.
The suit resulted in a compromise decree.
In pursuance of the compromise a further agreement dated December 1, 1960 was executed between the parties.
However in 1963 respondent No. 1 again filed a suit claiming as a sub lessee or as lessee a right to exhibit films in the said building and praying that the defendants be restrained from interfering with that right.
The suit was filed under section 28 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 in the Court of Small Causes.
In this suit respondent No. 1 asked the court to try additional issues Nos. 11, 12 and 13 as preliminary issues.
In issue No. 11 the question raised was whether the consent decree in the earlier suit operated as res judicata so that R & F could not question that the agreements between them and respondent No. 1 constituted a lease.
Issue No. 12 raised the question whether in view of the consent decree R & F were estopped from leading evidence and asking questions in cross examination to show that the said agreements did not constitute a lease.
Issue No. 13 raised the question whether section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act debarred R & F from leading evidence to the effect that the documents in question did not constitute a lease.
The Trial Court refused to try these as preliminary issues and its order was upheld by the High Court.
At the hearing of the case when the counsel for the defendants sought to ask a witness for respondent No. 1 whether the agreement dated November 27, 1954 was a commercial transaction and not a lease respondent No. 1 objected to the question.
The objection was disallowed by the trial court.
In revision under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure the High Court did not interfere with the trial court 's order in respect of issues Nos. 12 and 13.
In respect of issue No. 11, the High Court held that the agreement dated November 27, 1954 must in view of the consent decree in suit No. 149 of 1960 be held to be a lease, and that the consent decree created a bar of res judicata in respect of the issue whether the said agreement created a lease.
The defendants appellants appealed to this Court.
HELD : (i) The High Court had no jurisdiction to record any finding on the issue of res judicata in a revision application filed against an order refusing to uphold an objection to certain question asked to a witness under examination.
The Court erred in proceeding to decide matters on which no decision was till then recorded by the trial court and which could not be decided by the High Court until the parties had opportunity of leading evidence thereon.
(ii) By ordering that a question may properly be put to a witness who was examined, no case was decided by the Trial Court within the meaning of section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The expression 'case ' is not limited in its import to the entirety of the matter in dispute in a proceeding.
Such an interpretation may result in certain cases in denying relief to the aggrieved litigant where it is most needed.
But equally, it is not every order of the court in the course of a suit that amounts to a case decided.
A case may be said to be decided only if the court adjudicates, for the purpose of the suit, some right or obligation of the parties in controversy.
[441H 442C] Major section section Khanna vs Brig.
F. J, Dillon, [1964] 4 S.C.R. 409, referred to.
(iii) A consent decree, according to the decisions of this Court, does not operate as res judicata, because a consent decree is merely the record of a contract between the parties to, a suit, to which is superadded the seal of the court.
A matter in contest in a suit may operate as res judicata only if there is an adjudication by the court : the terms of section 1 1 of the Code leave no scope for a contrary view.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHINGHAL, J.
These two are companion appeals by special leave.
They have been heard together at the in stance.
of the learned counsel for the parties, and will be disposed by a common judgment.
Appeal No. 1951 of 1975 is directed against the award of the Industrial Tribunal Gujarat, dated September 24, 1975, in the dispute between the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., Baroda, and its workmen, while appeal No. 631 of 1976 arises out of the Tribunal 's award in the dispute between Jyoti Limited, Baroda, and its workmen.
Speaking broadly, the dispute in both cases related to the workmen 's demand for 10 days sick leave, with retrospective effect, and ,its accumulation over a period of three years i.e. upto 30 days.
The workmen particularly felt aggrieved because by virtue of the first proviso to section 49 of the , hereinafter referred to as the Act, they were not entitled to the sickness benefit for the first two days of sickness except in the case of a, spell of sickness following, at an interval of not more than 15 days, the spell of sickness for which sickness benefit was last paid.
It was also a grievance that the benefit under the scheme of the Act was much less than the normal earnings of an employee and was not beneficial to the workmen.
The demand was resisted by the Companies in both cases.
In the case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., it was contended that the Act provided more than adequate sickness benefits, and any additional 82 benefit would place unproductive financial burden on the industry and would have an all round adverse effect on other industries.
It was also urged that section 99 of the Act gave wide powers to the Employees ' State Insurance Corpora tion to enhance the benefit and it was therefore the proper authority to examine the demand.
The Company also contended that there was no practice of giving any such sick leave in the industries in Baroda or in the State of Gujarat.
In the case of Jyoti Ltd. an objection was taken that the reference was incompetent and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain it.
It was also pointed out that the benefit of sick.leave of 7 days per year was initially given to the workmen under an award dated August 29, 1958 which contained a specific direction that it would be automatically discon tinued when the benefits of the Employees ' State Insurance scheme would become available to the workmen, and also that the reasonableness of the demand could not be examined by the Tribunal.
An objection was also taken that the workmen had benefited a lot under the entire scheme of the Act and it would not be reasonable and proper to confer any addi tional benefit as the demands would place a heavy financial burden on the Company which it Could not bear.
The demand, according to the Company, would create an absurd position inasmuch as a worker would receive more wages by remaining absent than on duty.
The Company also pleaded that the demand for sickness leave could not be granted retrospec tively or allowed to accumulate.
While the reference in the case of Jyoti Ltd., Baroda, was still pending, the Tribunal gave its award dated Septem ber 24, 1975 in the case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd. The Tribunal, inter alia, awarded 7 days sick leave with full pay and dearness allowance to the workmen of that Company in a year, with the facility of accumulation upto 21 days.
It was stated before the Tribunal, on behalf of the workmen of Jyoti Ltd., that the arguments advanced and the contentions made in the case of the Alembic Glass industries may be considered as those made in their case also.
The reference in the case of Jyoti Ltd. proceeded accordingly and resulted in the award dated March 9, 1976 to which reference has been made above.
The award was on the lines of the earlier award in the case of the Alembic Glass Indus tries case, except .that the direction regarding 7 days sick leave was given retrospective effect from January 1, 1975.
The Company applied for and obtained special leave to appeal as aforesaid, with the further direction that the appeal may be heard along with the identical matter (in the Alembic Glass Industries case).
This is why these two have become companion appeals and are being disposed of together.
The controversy in these cases is whether the benefits admissible under the Act in the matter of the grant of sick leave are such as to justify the rejection of the workmen 's demand and the setting aside of the Tribunal 's awards in that respect.
It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appel lants that as the benefits of sections 47 and 49 of the Act are already admissible to workmen in Baroda with effect from December 14, 1969, and they are quite adequate, the Tribunal committed an error 83 of law in granting the additional benefits mentioned above.
Reference in this connection has been made to section 61 of the Act which provides that when a person is entitled to any of the benefits provided by the Act, he shall not be enti tled to receive any similar benefit admissible under the provisions of any other enactment.
The argument was raised in the Tribunal, but was rejected.
A similar question arose for consideration in The Hindustan Times Ltd., New Delhi vs Their Workmen(1) and was answered as follows by this Court, ""Mr. Pathak has tried to convince us that in view of the provisions of the , no provision need be made about sickness leave at all.
That this Act has been applied, to the Company and that the workmen of the Company get the benefit of this Act is not disputed.
It is difficult to see however how the benefit that the workmen will get under this Act can affect the question of sickness leave being provided for the workmen.
This Act it has to be noticed does not provide for any leave to the workmen on the ground of sickness.
It provides in section 46(1)(a) for periodical treatment of any insured person in case of his sickness if certified by a duly appointed medical practitioner.
It is unnec essary to mention here the several provisions in the Act; viz., Sections 47, 48 and 49 which deal 'with the eligibility of workmen for sickness .benefit and the extent of the benefit that may be granted.
Section 56 of the Act pro vides for medical benefits to the insured workmen or in certain cases to the members of his family.
It appears to us clear however that in providing for periodical payments to an insured worker in case of sickness (sickness benefit) or for medical treatment or attendance to him or the members of his family, the legislature did not intend to substitute any of these benefits for the workmen 's right to get leave on full pay on the ground of sickness.
"" The matter came up again for consideration by this Court in Technological Institute of Textiles vs Its Workmen and others(2) and it was held as follows with specific reference to the first proviso to section 49 of the Act according to which a person qualified to claim sickness benefit is not enti tled to it for the initial waiting period of two days except in the case of continuous illness of the nature mentioned therein, ""With regard to sick leave, the argument on behalf of the appellant was that benefits were granted by the , but .that is not a bar to the demand of the workmen for sick leave.
The reason is that the first proviso to section 49 of the Employees ' State (1) [1964] 1 S.C.R. 234.
(2) [1965] 2 L L.3,149.
84 Insurance Act states that a person qualified to claim sickness benefit shall not be entitled to the benefit for an initial waiting period of two days except in the case of a spell of sickness following at an interval of not more than fifteen days, the spell of sickness for which benefit was last paid.
It is apparent that the Employees ' State Insurance Scheme does not cover all contingencies of sickness and in any event the first two waiting days are not covered.
In our opinion, the tribunal was, there fore, justified in its view that the workmen are entitled to 7 days ' sick leave with wages on pro duction of a medical certificate.
"" It would thus appear that the Scheme of the benefits admissible under the Act cannot be said to cover the work men 's demand for sick leave to the extent allowed by the Tribunal.
Section 61 of the Act cannot thus be said to be applicable for the simple reason that the benefits granted by the Tribunal are not similar to those admissible under the Act.
The Act does not in fact deal with the question of sickness leave.
The other question regarding the adequacy of the sick ness benefit under the provisions of the Act has been exam ined by the Tribunal with reference to the reports of the National Commission of Labour, 1969, the Labour Laws Review Committee and the Norms Committee of Gujarat State, which go to show that the benefit cannot b.e said to be adequate for, it works out to about half the average wage of a workman, and even that amount is not admissible for the first two days of sickness except in the case of a spell of sickness following, at an interval of not more than 15 days, the spell of sickness for which the sickness benefit was last paid.
It has to be appreciated that a workman is prevented from earning the normal daily wages during the period of his illness and there is no justification for the argument that the rate of benefit at about half his wage, under the Act, should be considered sufficient so as to deny him the bene fit of sick leave on full emoluments for a period of 7 days when he is certified by a competent medical officer to be ill for that or a longer period.
Sickness is a serious misfortune to a workman for it not only prevents him from earning his normal wages, but is a drain on his meagre financial resources by way of additional expenditure on food, nursing and visits to the medical centre etc.
It has not been disputed before us that the ""region cure industry"" basis is suitable in cases like the present for examining any controversy regarding the work man 's demand for additional benefits, but it has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that the award of the benefit of sick leave to the workers of the two Compa nies could not be justified on that basis.
We find that the Tribunal has examined this aspect of the controversy also, and we have no reason to disagree with the view which it has taken.
As has been stated, the Act came into force in the region concerned on December 14, 1969, and it has not been disputed before us that till then it was the practice in the glass industries to grant sick leave with wages for periods varying from 6 to 10 days.
In fact in the 85 case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., Baroda, the Tribunal made an award for 7 days sick leave on full pay and dearness allowance in 1958, subject to the condition that the benefit would cease to apply when the benefits of the Act became available to the workmen.
The benefit of sick leave was therefore lost when the Act was made applicable to the region from December 14, 1969.
That was obviously under a mistaken impression of the sickness benefit which the Act allowed for, as has been shown, it does not deal with all aspects of the demand for sickness benefit and does not, at any rate, provide for the grant of leave on full emoluments during the period of the workman 's physical incapacity to earn his normal wages because of his sickness.
It there fore appears that the Tribunal could not be said to have erred in restoring the benefit which the workmen were re ceiving under the award of 1958, for it was taken away under the mistaken impression that it had been adequately replaced by the new provisions on the coming into force of the Act.
The appellants have filed a statement (exhibit 7) containing information regarding the companies which have provided the benefit of sick leave to its workmen in the region.
It shows that even though the Act was applicable to the workers of the Precision Bearings India Ltd., Baroda, Hindustan Brown Bovari Ltd., Baroda, the Associated Cement Companies Ltd., and M.S. University Press, Baroda, the benefit of sick leave has been allowed to the workmen of.
those companies.
It is therefore .futile to contend that the benefit should not be admissible on the ground that it had not been allowed by other companies in the region.
We also find that such a benefit has been allowed in the case of glass industries by Shree Vallabha Glass Works Ltd., Vallabh Vidyanagar, Ogale Glass Works Ltd., Oglewadi and Vijay Glass Works, Bombay.
Even the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd. has allowed 6 days sick leave in a year to its employ ees in Bangalore and it is permissible to accumulate it upto 12 days in addition to the current year 's leave, under a settlement dated July 17, 1969, which is being continued even after the coming into force of the Act.
Learned coun sel for the appellants have invited our attention to the case between the Textile Labour Association and the Ahmeda bad Millowner 's Association where the demand for sick leave was refused but, as the Tribunal has pointed out, the demand there was for a month 's leave every year in addition to 15 days casual leave and pay in lieu of privilege leave.
The Full Bench of the Industrial Court in that case considered the paying capacity of the mills also, and held that the additional leave demanded by the workmen would be very much beyond the paying capacity of the industry.
As against this, the Tribunal has examined the financial capacity of the two companies in question, and has given adequate rea sons for holding that they are in good financial position and can bear the additional burden of sick leave.
Learned counsel for the appellants have in fact not advanced any argument to the contrary.
Mr. S.T. Desai has raised the argument, in the case of Jyoti Ltd., Baroda, that the Tribunal laboured under a misconception that 86 the sickness benefit would be lost for the first two days of sickness under the first proviso to section 49 of the Act, that the Tribunal should not, in any view of the matter, have given the benefit of 7 days sick leave, and that the workmen did not deserve anything more than sickness benefit for the first two days also.
According to him, what has been awarded by the Tribunal is additional privilege leave for 7 days in the garb of sick leave.
The argument is however futile because, as has been stated, the Tribunal has cor rectly examined the controversy and given adequate reasons for allowing the benefit of 7 days sick leave in the manner set out in the award.
Such a leave could not be categorised as privilege leave as, by its very nature, it would be admissible only in the case of actual sickness certified by a registered medical practitioner.
It would thus appear that the appellants have not been able to show that the awards in question are illegal or unjust; or would adversely affect the economy or the indus trial peace, or lead to imbalance in the conditions of service in other industrial establishments.
It appears, however, that it was not necessary, in the circumstances of the case, to award the benefit of the sick leave with retro spective effect from January 1, 1975, in the case of Jyoti Ltd. Baroda.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed except that the award in the case of Jyoti Ltd., Baroda, is made effective from the date of its commencement.
The appellant companies shall pay to the workmen ' the costs of these appeals; one set of counsel 's fees.
P.B.R. Appeals dismissed.
","The workmen 's demand for grant of sick leave and its accumulation upto a period was rejected by the employers on the ground that the provided more than adequate sickness benefits, and that any additional benefits would place a financial burden on the industry and would adversely affect other industries in the region.
The Tribunal, to which the dispute was referred, partly granted the workmen 's demand.
On appeal to this Court it was contended that section 61 of the debarred a person enti tled to any of the benefits under that Act from receiving similar benefit under the provisions of any other Act and as such the workmen were not entitled to the benefit of sick leave.
Dismissing the appeals, HELD: (1) The , does not deal with the question of sick leave.
The scheme of the benefits admissible under the Act does not cover the work men 's demand for sick leave to the extent allowed by the Tribunal.
Section 61 is not applicable because the benefits granted by the Tribunal are not similar to those admissible under the Act.
[84 C] The Hindustan Times Ltd., New Delhi vs Their Workmen [1964] 1 SCR 234 and Technological Institute of Textiles vs Its Workmen and others applied.
(2) Sickness benefit under the Act cannot be said to be adequate, for, it works out to about half the average wage of a workman which benefit is not admissible for the first two days of sickness except under the conditions provided in the Act.
A workman is prevented from earning the normal daily wages during the period of his illness and there is no justification for the argument that the rate of benefit at about half his wage, under the Act, should be considered sufficient so as to deny him the benefit of sick leave on full emoluments for a period of 7 days when he is certi fied by a competent medical officer to be ill for that or a longer period.
Sickness is a serious misfortune to a work man for it not only prevents him from earning his normal wages, but is a drain on his meagre financial resources by way of additional expenditure on food, nursing and visits to the medical centre etc.
[84 E F] (3) The Tribunal could not be said to have erred in restoring the benefit which the workmen were receiving under an earlier award.
The benefit of sick leave to the employ ees in the region was lost when the Act was made applicable to the region from December 14, 1969.
This was obviously under a mistaken impression.
The Act does not deal with all aspects of sickness benefit and does not provide for the grant of leave on full emoluments during the period of a workman 's physical incapacity to earn his normal wages because of his sickness.
[85 B C] (4) There is no force in the argument that the Tribunal had granted additional privilege leave for 7 days under the garb of sick leave because by its very nature sick leave would be admissible only in the case of actual sickness certified by a registered medical practitioner.
[86 B] (5) There is no evidence to show that the benefit had not been allowed by other companies in the region.
The Tribunal had examined the financial 81 capacity of the companies and had given adequate reasons for holding that they were in good financial position and could bear the additional burden.
[85 H] (6) It has not been shown that the awards are illegal or unjust, or would adversely affect the economy or the indus trial peace, or lead to imbalance in the conditions of service in other industrial establishments.

314,"iminal Appeal No. 48 of 1954.
1303 Appeal by Special Leave granted by the Supreme Court by its Order dated the 31st July 1953 from the Judgment and Order dated the 15th May 1953 of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Pepsu at Th, Patiala in Criminal Appeal No. 140 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 31st March 1952 of the Court of Magistrate 1st Class, Patiala in Challan Case No. 160/102 of 1951.
Jai Gopal Sethi, (Naunit Lal, with him) for the appellant.
N. section Bindra, (Porus A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale, with him) for the respondent.
February 28.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.
The appellant was a Sub Divisional Officer in the Public Works Department, Pepsu, and was, at the material dates,, in charge of certain works at a place called Karhali.
It was part of his duties to disburse the wages to the workmen employed in the works, and the procedure usually followed was that be drew the amount required from the treasury, and paid the same to the emplo yees against their signatures or thumb impressions in the monthly acquittance roll.
In the roll for April 1951, one Parma was mentioned as a khalasi (menial servant), and a sum of Rs. 51 shown as paid to him for his wages, the payment being vouched by thumbimpression.
The case of the prosecution was that there was, in fact, no person of the name of Parma, that the thumb impression found in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant himself, that he had included a fictitious name in the acquittance roll, with intent to himself draw the amount, and that by this expedient he had received Rs. 51 and misappropriated the same.
The First Class Magistrate of Patiala, before whom the appellant was put up for trial, framed charges against him under section 465 of the Indian Penal Code for forging the thumb impression of Parma, and under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal misappropriation of Rs. 51, and after a full trial, 167 1304 acquitted him.
He held on the evidence that ""there was a khalasi Parma by name in the service of the accused at Kehrauli"", and that though the thumbimpression in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant, the prosecution had not established that the amount drawn by him did not reach the hands of Parma.
Against this judgment, there was an appeal by the State to the High Court of Pepsu, which held that proof that the thumb impression in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant was sufficient, ,.when taken along with other circumstances, to establish his guilt, and accordingly convicted him both under section 465 and section 409 of the Indian Penal Code.
This appeal by special leave is directed against this judgment.
In support of "" the appeal it is argued by Mr. Jai Gopal Sethi that the conviction of the appellant is illegal, as sanction had not been obtained under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for his prosecution, that the evidence on record is insufficient to establish an offence either under section 465 or section 409 of the Indian Penal Code and that there having been an acquittal of the appellant by the trial Magistrate, the materials on record did not justify a reversal of that verdict by the appellate Court.
The question of sanction under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be taken up first for consideration, as it goes to the root of the matter.
The facts bearing on this question are that there was an application by the Department for sanction to prosecute the appellant for an offence under section 409, and that, the Chief Secretary, Home Department, sent the communication, Exhibft PX, stating that he had been ""directed to convey sanction of the Government to his prosecution"".
In view of this, no question was raised before the trial Magistrate or the High Court that the prosecution was bad for want of sanction.
But after the disposal of the appeal by the High Court, it was discovered that, in fact, there was no order of the Government sanctioning the prosecution, and that the Chief Secretary had committed a mistake in sendidg the communication, Exhibit PX.
1305 The position, therefore, is that the prosecution which has resulted in the conviction of the appellant was initiated without any sanction under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and if sanction under that section is necessary, as contended for by Mr. Sethi, then the entire proceedings including the conviction must be quashed.
According to the respondent, however, the main charge against the appellant is under section 409, and no sanction is required for a prosecution under that section.
The point for decision is whether sanction under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is necessary for prosecuting the appellant under section 409.
There has been considerable divergence of judicial opinion on the scope of section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The question has latterly been the subject of consideration by the highest Courts in this country, and by the Privy Council, and the position may now be taken to be fairly well settled.
Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor(1) is a decision of the Federal Court on the necessity for sanction under section 270 of the Government of India Act, 1935, which is similar in terms to section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The facts in that case were that a Sub Assistant Surgeon was charged under section 409 with having dishonestly removed certain medicines from a hospital which was under his charge, to his own residence, and under section 477 A, with having failed to enter them in the stock book.
The sanction of the Government had not been obtained for the prosecution under section 270 of the Government of India Act, and the point for decision was whether it was necessary.
It was held that the charge under section 477 A required sanction, as ""the official capacity is involved in the very act complained of as amounting to a crime""; but that no sanction was required for a charge under section 409, because ""the official capacity is material only in connection with the 'entrustment ' and does not necessarily enter into the later act of misappropriation or conversion, which is the act complained of"".
(1) 1306 In the course of his judgment, Varadachariar, J. discussed the scope of section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and after observing that the decisions on that section were not uniform, proceeded to group them under three categories those which had held that sanction was necessary when the act complained of attached to ' the official character of the person doing it, those which had held that it was necessary in all cases in which the official character of the person gave him an opportunity for the commission of the crime, and those which had held it necessary when the offence was committed while the accused was actually engaged in the performance of official duties.
The learned Judge expressed his agreement with the first of the three views.
In H. H. B. Gill vs The King(1), the question arose directly with reference to section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
There, the accused was charged under section 161 with taking bribes, and under section 120 B with conspiracy.
On the question whether sanction was necessary under section 197(1) it was held by the Privy Council that there was no difference in scope between that section and section 270 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and approving the statement of the law by Varadachariar, J. in Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor(2), Lord Simonds observed: ""A public servant can only be said to act or to purport to act in the discharge of his official duty, if his act is such as to lie within the scope of his official duty. .
The test may well be whether the public servant, if challenged, can reasonably claim that, what he does, he does in virtue of his office"".
It was accordingly held that as the acts with which the accused was charged could not be justified as done by virtue of his office, no sanction was necessary.
The view taken in H. H. B. Gill vs The King(1) was followed by the Privy Council in A16 ert West Meads vs The King( '), and reaffirmed in Phanindra Chandra vs (1) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.
(2) (3) [1948] L.,R. 70 I.A. 185, 1307 The King(1), and adopted by this Court in R. W. Mathams V. State of We8t Bengal(1).
The result of the authorities may thus be summed up: It is not every offence committed by a public servant that requires sanction for prosecution under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure; nor even every act done by him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if the act complained of is directly concerned with his official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction would be necessary; and that would be so, irrespective of whether it was, in fact, a proper discharge of his duties, because that would really be a matter of defence on the merits, which would have to be in vestigated at the trial, and could not arise at the stage of the grant of sanction, which mu_t precede the institution of the prosecution.
It is conceded for the respondent that on the principle above enunciated, sanction would be required for prosecuting the appellant under section 465, as the charge was in respect of his duty of obtaining signatures or thumb impressions of the employees before wages were paid to them.
But he contends that misappropriation of funds could, under no circumstances, be said to be within the scope of the duties of a public servant, that he could not, when charged with it, claim justification for it by virtue of his office, that therefore no sanction under section 197(1) was necessary, and that the question was concluded by the decisions in Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor(1) and Albert We8t Meads vs The King(1), in both of which the charges were of criminal misappropriation.
We are of opinion that this is too broad a statement of the legal position, and that the two decisions cited lend no support to it.
In our judgment, even when the charge is one of misappropriation by a public servant, whether sanction is required under section 197(1) will depend upon the facts of each case.
If the acts complained of are so integrally connected with the duties attach (1) [1949] L.R. 76 I.A. 10.
(3) (2) [1955] 1 S.O.R. 216.
(4) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 180, 1308 ing to the office as to be inseparable from them, then sanction under section 197(1) would be necessary; but if there was no necessary connection between them and the performance of those duties) the official status furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the acts, then no sanction would be required.
Quite recently, this Court had to consider in Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli vs The State of Bombay(1) the necessity for sanction under section 197(1), when the charge was one of misappropriation under section 409.
There, the law was laid down in the following terms: ""The section has content and its language must be given meaning.
What it says is 'When any public servant. . is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. .
We have therefore first to concentrate on the word ""offence '.
Now an offence seldom consists of a single act.
It is usually composed of several elements and, as a rule, a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.
In the present case, the elements alleged against the second accused are, first, that there was an 'entrustment ' and/or 'dominion '; second, that the entrustment and/or dominion was 'in his capacity as a public servant '; third, that there was a 'disposal '; and fourth, that the disposal was 'dishonest '.
Now it is evident that the entrustment and/or dominion here were in an official capacity, and it is equally evident that there could in this case be no disposal, lawful or otherwise, save by an act done or purporting to be done in an official capacity"".
On the facts, it was held in that case that the several acts which were complained of, were official acts, and that the prosecution was bad for want of sanction.
The decisions in Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor(1), and Albert West Meads vs The King(1), when properly examined, do not support the extreme contention (1) (2) (3) [1948] L.R 75 I.A. 185.
1309 urged on behalf of the respondent.
In Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor(1), the medicines had not been entered in the stock book, and were removed by the accused to his residence, and the charge against him was that in so removing them he had committed MISappropriation.
It was no part of the duty of the accused to remove medicines to his house, and he could not claim that he did so by virtue of his office.
He could have made such a claim if he had, let us suppose, entered the medicines in the stock books and shown them as expended in the hospital.
But, on the facts, no official act was involved, and that was why Varadachariar, J. observed that, "". so far as the charge under section 409 was con cerned, the acts in respect of which he was intended to be prosecuted could not be regarded as acts done or purported to be done in execution of his duty"".
Reference may also be made to the following observations of Sulaiman, J. in the same case: ""The question whether a criminal breach of trust can be committed while purporting to act in execution of his duty is not capable of being answered hypothetically in the abstract, without any reference to the actual facts of the case.
An attempt to answer the question in a generalized way has been responsible for loose language used in some of the cases cited before us.
The question whether the act purported to have been done in execution of duty or not must depend on the special circumstances of each case"".
In Albert West Meads vs The King(1), an Army Officer had received two sums of money, and was subsequently unable to produce them.
He was charged with criminal misappropriation, and convicted.
He contended that the conviction was illegal for want of sanction, but the Privy Council, following H. H. B. Gill vs The King(1), rejected this contention.
It is essential to note that the accused did not claim to have spent the amount in the course of his official duties, but stated that the moneys had been con sumed by fire.
It is with reference to these facts that the Privy Council observed: (1) (2) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 185.
(3) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 41.
1310 of which he was charged ', i.e. acts of fraudulently misapplying money entrusted to his care as a public servant, 'as acts done by him by virtue of the office that he held ' "".
The result then is that whether sanction is necessary to prosecute a public servant on a charge of criminal misappropriation, will depend on whether the acts complained of hinge on his duties as a pubic servant.
If they do, then sanction is requisite.
But if they are unconnected with such duties, then no sanction is necessary.
In this view, we have to examine whether the acts with which the appellant is charged directly bear on the duties which he has got to discharge as a public servant.
The appellant received the sum of Rs. 51 alleged to have been misappropriated, as Subdivisions Officer, and he admits receipt of the same.
Then it was his duty to pay that amount to the khalasi Parma, and take his signature or thumb impression in acknowledgment thereof.
The accused does claim to have paid the amount to Parma, and the acquittance roll records the payment, and there is in acknowledgment thereof a thumb impression as against his name.
If what appears on the face of the roll is true and whether it is true or not is not a matter relevant at the stage of sanction then the acts with which the appellant is charged fall within the scope of his duties, and can be justified by him as done by virtue of his office.
Clearly, therefore, sanction was required under section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the appellant could be prosecuted under section 409, and the absence of such sanc tion is fatal to the maintainability of the prosecution.
The conviction should, therefore, be quashed.
In this view, there is no need to consider whether on the evidence, the offence of criminal misappropriation or forgery has been brought home to the appellant or not.
The appeal is accordingly allowed, and the convictions and sentences passed on the appellant arc set aside.
Fine, if paid, will be refunded.
Appeal allowed.
","It is not every offence committed by a public servant that requires sanction for prosecution under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure nor even every act done by him while he is actually engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if the act complained of is directly concerned with his official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by virtue of the office, then sanction would be necessary; and that would be so, irrespective of whether it was, in fact, a proper discharge of his duties, because that would really be a matter of defence on the merits, which would have to be investigated at the trial, and could not arise at the stage of the grant of sanction, which must precede the institution of the prosecution.
Whether sanction is necessary to prosecute a public servant on a charge of criminal misappropriation, will depend on whether the acts complained of hinge on his duties as a public servant.
If they do, then sanction is requisite.
But if they are unconnected with such duties, then no sanction is necessary.

6881,"Appeal No. 4366 of 1991.
From the Judgment and Order dated 16.5.1988 of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Regular Second Appeal No. 3648 of 1987.
R.K.Kapoor and Anis Ahmed Khan for the Appellant.
S.N.Mishra, L.K. Gupta, D.K. Yadav and D.K.Garg for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AHMADI, J.
Delay condoned.
Special leave granted.
The constitutional validity of section 15(1)(a) of the Punjab Preemption Act, 1913 was challenged on the ground that it offended the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(f) m Ram Sarup vs Munshi & Ors., A Constitution Bench of this Court upheld the validity holding that there was no infringement of Article 19(1)(1 ') of the Constitution.
Thereafter, a host of writ petitions 122 were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitu tion challenging the constitutional validity of section 15 on the ground that it infringed Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
It may be mentioned that the mother State, the State of Punjab, had repealed the Act in 1973 but it contin ued to be in force in the State of Haryana which prior to 1966 was a part of the State of Punjab.
Section 15 of the 1913 Act, as it originally stood, underwent substantial changes in 1960 and as amended read as under: ""15.
Persons in whom right of pre emption vests in respect of sales of agricultural land and village immovable property (1) The right of pre emption in respect of agricultural land and village immovable property shall vest (a) where the sale is by a sole onwer First, in the son or daughter or son 's son or daughter 's son of the vendor; Secondly, in the brother or brother 's son of the vendor; Thirdly, in the father 's brother or father 's brother 's son of the vendor; Fourthly, in the tenant who holds under tenan cy of the vendor the land or properly sold or a part thereof Co) where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property and is not made by all the co sharers jointly First, in the sons or daughters or son 's son or daughter 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Secondly, in the brothers or brother 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Thirdly, in the father 's brother or father 's brother 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Fourthly, in the other co sharers; Fifthly, in the tenants who hold under tenancy of the vendor or vendors the land or property sold or a part thereof; (c) where the sale is of land or property owned jointly and is made by all the co shar ers jointly 123 First, in the sons or daughters or sons ' sons or daughters ' sons of the vendors; Secondly in the brothers or brother 's sons of the vendors; Thirdly, in the father 's brothers or father 's brother 's sons of the vendors Fourthly, in the tenants, who hold under tenancy of the vendors or any one of them the land or properly sold or a part thereof.
(2) Notwithstanding anything con tained in sub section (1): (a ') where the sale is by a female of land or property to which she has succeeded through her father or brother or the sale in respect of such land or property is by the son or daughter of such female after inheritance, the right of pre emption shall vest: (i) if the sale is by such female, in her brother or brother 's son; (ii) if the sale is by the son or daughter of such female, in the mother 's brothers or the mother 's brother 's sons of the vendor or vendors; (b) where the sale is by a female of land or property to which she has succeeded through her husband, or through her son in case the son has inherited the land or property sold from his lather, the right of pre emption shall vest First, in the son or daughter of such husband of the female: Secondly, in the husband 's brother or hus band 's brother 's son of such female."" This Court in Atam Prakash vs State of Haryana & Ors, ; ; held that the right of pre emption given to co sharers as well as to a tenant can be justified as they constitute a class by themselves.
This Court, therefore, upheld the constitutional validity of clause 'fourthly of section 15(1)(a) clauses 'fourthly ' and 'fifthly ' of section 15(1)(b) and clause fourthly of section 15(1)(c) as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court, however, did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
The right of preemption based on consanguinity was held to be a relic of the feudal past totally inconsistent with the constitutional philosophy and scheme.
It also found the list of kinsfolk entitled to pre emption as intrinsically defec tive and Self contradictory.
Finding no reasonable classifi cation it struck down 124 clauses 'first ', 'secondly ' and 'thirdly ' of section 15(1)(a), clauses 'first ', 'secondly ', and 'thirdly ' of section 15(1)(b) and clause 'first ', 'secondly ', and 'third ly ' of section 15(1)(c) and the entire section 15(2) as ultra vires the Constitution.
The right of pre emption in regard to a co sharer was upheld on the consideration that if an outsider is introduced as a co sharer in a property it will make common management extremely difficult and destroy the benefits of ownership in common.
The right of pre emp tion vested in a tenant was sustained on the ground that 1 and reform legislations in regard to the tiller of the soil to obtain proprietary right in the soil with a view to ensuring his continuance in possession of the land and consequently of his livelihood without threat or disturbance from the superior proprietor.
The right of pre emption granted to a tenant was taken as another instance of a legislation aimed at protecting the tenant 's interest in the land.
Holding that the co sharers and the tenants constitut ed a distinct class by themselves, the right of pre emption conferred on them was upheld as reasonable and in public interest.
In taking this view strong reliance was placed on the ratio of the decision of this court in Bhau Ram vs
B. Baijnath Singh, ; wherein the vires of a provision of the Rewa State Pre emption Act which conferred a right of pre emption based on vicinage and the right of preemption conferred on co sharers and the Punjab Pre emption Act, 1913 were challenged on the ground of infraction of Article 19(1) (f) of the Constitu tion.
In that case it was held that a right of pre emption by vicinage offended Article 19(1) (f) of the Constitution but a similar right conferred on co sharers was intra vires Article 19(1)(1) of the Constitution.
In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold, acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 19(1)(1) of the Constitution.
In Atam Prakash s case, this Court, therefore, held that what was said about the right of pre emption granted to co sharers in relation to Article 19(1)(1) of the Constitution applied with equal force to justify the classification in relation to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
After the surgery, section 15 underwent at the hands of this Court removing the offending pans in Atarn Prakash 's case, what survives of section 15 is that in the case of sale of agricultural land and village immovable property by a sole owner, the tenant alone can exercise the right of pre emption.
Where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property, and is, not made by all the co sharers jointly, only the other co sharers and the tenants can exercise the right of pre emption.
Where the sale is of a land or proper ty owned jointly and is made by all the co sharers jointly, the right to pre empt survives to the tenants only.
Since in the present case, we are concerned with sale by a single co sharer and not 125 by all the co sharers jointly, the remaining part of section 15(1)(b), with which we are concerned, reads as under: ""15(b).
Persons in whom right of pre emption vests in respect of sales of agricultural land and village immovable property (1) The right of pre emption in respect of agricultural land and village immovable property shall vest Co) where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property and is not made by all the co sharers jointly XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX Fourthly, in the other co sharers; Fifthly, in the tenants who hold under tenancy of the vendor or vendors the land or property sold or a part thereof."" Counsel for the appellant submitted that since the suit land belonged to more than one co sharer and had not been sold jointly by all the co sharers, he, as a co sharer, was entitled to claim the right of pre emption under clause 'fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b).
A similar question came up before this Court in Jagdish & Ors.
vs Nathi Mal Kejriwal & 0rs.
; , ; wherein a two judge Bench of this Court negatived the contention in the follow ing words: ""In order to understand the meaning of the words 'other co sharers ' in Section 15(1)(b) we have to read the Act as it stood before the decision in Atam Prakash 's case ; (supra).
It is seen that the expression 'other co sharers ' in clause 'Fourthly ' of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act refers to only those co sharers who do not fail under clause 'First ' or 'Secondly ' or 'Thirdly ' of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act.
Since the petitioners admittedly fall either under clause 'First ' or under clause 'Secondly ' of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act they are clearly outside the scope of clause 'Fourthly '.
Therefore, the petition ers cannot claim the right of pre emption under clause 'Fourthly ' We do not, therefore, find any substance in this contention. "" In the present case also the appellant seeks to exercise the right of pre emption as a co sharer i.e. father 's broth er 's son of the vendors.
His contention is that he falls within the expression other co sharers ' in clause 'Fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b) and is, therefore, entitled to exercisee the right of pre emption conferred on him by that provision.
The courts below 126 have negatived this contention solely on the ground that it cannot stand after the pronouncement of this Court in the case of Jagdish (supra).
Counsel for the appellant, however, contended that the interpretation placed by the two judge Bench on the expression 'other co sharers ' in section 15(1)(b) requires reconsideration as it leads to certain anomalous situation e.g. a sister who is a co sharer can claim pre emption while her brother cannot or a daughter 's daughter of the vendor can claim pre emption but not the son.
The history of the Punjab Pre emption law may be kept in mind to understand the purport of clause 'Fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b) of the Act.
Under the Punjab Pre emption Act, 1905, the corresponding provision, section 12, con ferred a right of pre emption, in the case of a sale of a share of such land or properly held jointly, firstly, in the lineal discendents of the vendor in male line in order of succession; secondly, in the co sharers, if any, who are agnates, in order of succession; thirdly, in the persons described in sub clause (a) i.e. in persons who but for such sale would be entitled to inherit the properly in the event of his or their decease, in order of succession and fourth ly, in the co sharers jointly or severally.
It will be noticed that priority for the exercise of the right owes statutorily fixed and even in the case of those falling within the same class, the exercise of right was regulated by the use of the expression, 'in order of succession '.
The 1905 Act was repealed and replaced by the 1913 Act.
Accord ing to section 15 of this Act before its amendment in1960, in the case of sale of a share out of joint land or proper ty, the right of preemption was conferred firstly on the lineal descendents of the vendor in order of succession; secondly, in the co sharers, if any, who are agnates, in order of succession; thirdly in persons not included under firstly or secondly above, in order of succession, who but for such sale would be entitled, on death of the vendor, to inherit the land or property sold and fourthly, in the co sharers.
Section 15 after its amendment in 1960 provided that where the sale is of a share out of the joint land or property and is not by all the co sharers jointly, the right of pre emption was vested, first, in the sons or daughters or son 's son or daughter 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Secondly, in the brothers or brother 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Thirdly, in the father 's brother or father 's broth er 's sons of the vendor or vendors Fourthly, in the other co sharers and Fifthly n the tenants.
Read in the context, it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression 'other co sharers ' in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that, no co sharer is left out.
Since this Court found certain intrinsic contradictions in the list of relatives covered by the first three clauses, it saw no justification for the classification contained in the said provision conferring a right based on consanguinity and, therefore, struck down those clauses:as discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
At the same time it upheld the right conferred on co sharers for reasons stated earlier.
Thus the purport of Atam Prakash 's case (supra) was that while co sharers were entitled to pre empt, the confer ment of that right on certain kinsfolk based on the rule of consanguinity being a relic of the feudal past could not be tolerated.
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 15(1)(b) of the Act.
Once conferment of the right of pre emption in favour of co sharers was considered to be a reasonable restriction on the right to hold, acquire and dispose of property under Article 19(1) (f), the same re striction was held to be valid when tested on the touchstone of Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court 's decision in Attam Prakash 's case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) even if they happen to be co sharers.
The expression 'other co sharers ' was used in the fourth clause of the said provision to ensure that no co sharer was left out or omitted and not to deny the right to kinstolk coshar ers covered by the preceding clauses.
If the preceding clauses were not erased from the statute book as unconstitu tional the kinsfolk would have exercised the right in the order of preference, for which no justification was found.
The relations in the first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) may or may not be co sharers, The use of the expression 'other ' in clause fourthly conveys the possibility of their being co sharer also.
What this Court disapproved as offen sive to Articles 14 and 15 is the classification based on consanguinity and not on co ownership.
The right of pre emption to co sharers is held to be intra vires the Consti tution Therefore, it is difficult to hold that this Court intended to deny the right of pre emption of those kinsfolk even if they happened to be co sharers.
That would clearly be discriminatory.
With respect, therefore, we find it difficult to approve of the interpretation placed on clause `fourthly '; of section 15(1)Co) of the Act by this Court in Jagdish 's case.
We think on a proper construction of that clause after the preceding clauses were held to be unconsti tutional the word 'other ' preceding.
the word 'co sharer ' is rendered redundant.
We, therefore, do not approve the ratio of Jagdish 's case and overrule the same.
In the result the appeal succeeds, '[he decision of all the three courts below dismissing the appellant 's suit is set aside and the suit is decreed.
128 We direct that on the appellant plaintiff depositing the entire amount of sale price together with the amount needed for the stamp duty for the execution of the conveyance in his favour within three months from today, the purchaser respondent No. 1 shah within one month of such deposit execute a conveyance of the land, i.e. his share therein derived from his vendors, in favour of the appellant and shall deliver possession thereof to the appellant.
If the respondent No. 1 fails to do so, the Court shall appoint a Commissioner who shall execute the conveyance on behalf of the respondent No. 1 and the Court shall put the appellant in possession of the suit land.
There will be no order as to costs throughout.
V.P.R. Appeal allowed.
","The appellant seeking to exercise the right of pre emption as a co sharer, i.e. father 's brother 's son of the vendors, contended that he fell within the expression 'other co sharers ' in clause 'Fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b) of the Punjab pre emption Act, 1913 and was, therefore, entitled to exercise the right of pre emption.
The courts below negatived his contention following the decision of this Court in Jagdish & Ors.
vs Nathi Mal Kej riwal & Ors.
; , In this appeal filed by special leave, the appellant submitted that since the suit land belonged to more than one co sharer and had not been sold jointly by all the co shar ers, he, as a co sharer, as entitled to claim the right of pre emption under clause 'fourthly 'of section 15(1)(b) and that in Jagdish 's case, the interpretation placed on the expression 'other co shar ers ' in section 15(1)(b) required reconsideration.
Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.
According to section 15 of the Act before its amendment in 1960, in the case of sale of share out of joint land or property, the right of pre emption was conferred firstly on the lineal descendants of the vendor in order of succession; secondly, in the co sharers, if any, who are agnates, in order of succession; thirdly, in persons not included under firstly or secondly above, in order of suc cession, who but for such sale would be entitled, on death of the 120 vendor, to inherit the land or property sold and fourthly, in the cosharers.

The legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifi cally mentioned in the preceding clauses it used the expres sion 'other co sharers ' in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure that no cosharer is left out.

The expression 'other co sharers ' was used in the fourth clause of the said provision to ensure that no co sharer was left out or omitted and not to deny the right to kinsfolk co sharers covered by the preceding clauses.
If the preceding clauses were not erased from the statute book as unconstitutional the kinsfolk would have exercised the right in the order of preference, for which no justification was found.
The relations in the first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) may or may not be co sharers.
The use of the ex pression 'other ' in clause fourthly conveys the possibility of their being cosharer also.

926 1960.
September 27.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA J.
M/s.
Daulatram Rameshwarlal, a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act (referred to later in this judgment as ""sellers "") are registered dealers under section 11 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.
In their return of turnover for the period from April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1955, they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts, under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream, and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286 (1)(b).
The Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales.
He also assessed them to purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act on their purchase of castor oil which they later sold for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 as mentioned above.
The notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30, 1956.
The sellers thereupon moved the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitu tion for the issue of appropriate writs for quashing the order of assessment and the notice of demand and for prohibiting the Sales Tax Officer from taking any steps pursuant to the order or the notice.
The learned Judge who heard the petition rejected the sellers ' contention that the goods remained their property till these crossed the customs frontier and therefore held that the sellers were not entitled to the benefit of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.
As regards the assessment to purchase tax also he rejected the sellers ' contention that the assessment in question was illegal.
In this view the learned Judge dismissed the application under article 226.
Against this decision the sellers appealed.
The 927 learned Judges who heard the appeal held, disagreeing with the Trial Judge, that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.
They however agreed with the Trial Judger that the sellers were liable to pay purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.
Accordingly they directed the Sales Tax Officer not to enforce the demand for payment of sales tax with regard to the sales of cotton for Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sale of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6.
The Sales Tax Officer has, on the strength of special leave granted by this Court, preferred the appeal which has been numbered as Civil Appeal No. 45 of 1959 against the appellate court 's order directing him not to realise the sales tax in respect of sales of cotton and castor oil.
Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 has been preferred by the sellers against the appellate court 's judgment in so far as it upheld the assessment of purchase tax under section 10(b).
The only ""question for our decision in the appeal by the Sales Tax Officer is whether property in the goods passed on shipment or at some point of time before shipment.
The law is now well settled that if the property in the goods passes to the buyer after they have for the purpose of export to a foreign country crossed the customs frontier the sale has taken place ""in course of the export"" out of the territory of India.
If therefore in the present sales the property in the goods passed to the buyers on shipment, that is, after they had crossed the customs frontier the sales must be held to have taken place ""in the course of export"" and the exemption under article 286(1)(b) will come into operation.
The sellers ' case is that these were sales on FOB contracts.
Though the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer tried to convince us that these were not really FOB contract sales, it appears that the averment in Paras.
11 and 13 of the writ petition that these sales were made on FOB basis were not denied in the counter affidavit sworn by the Sales Tax Officer.
It is also 928 worth noticing that in the assessment order itself the Sale Tax Officer referred to these sales as sales on FOB basis.
The specimen contract produced also used the words "" FOB delivered "".
There can be no doubt therefore that these were sales under FOB contracts. ' The normal rule in FOB contracts is that the property is intended to pass and does pass on the shipment of the goods.
In certain circumstances, e.g., if the seller takes the bill of , lading to his own order and parts with it to a third person the property in the goods, it has been held, does not pass to the buyer even on shipment.
We are not concerned here with the question whether the passing of property in the goods was postponed even after shipment.
The correctness of the proposition that in the absence of special agreement the property in the goods does not pass in the case of a FOB contract until the goods are actually put on board is not disputed before us.
As has however been rightly stressed by the learned Solicitor General it is always open to the parties to come to a different agreement as to when the Dropert in the goods shall pass.
The question whether there was such a different agreement has to be decided on a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.
He relies on three circumstances to convince us that the sellers and their buyers agreed in these sales that the property will pass to the buyer even before shipment.
The first circumstance on which he relies is that the bill of lading was taken in the name of the buyer.
Along with this fact we have to consider however the fact that the bill of lading was retained by the sellers, the contract being that payment will be made on the presentation of the bill of lading.
It is not disputed that the term in the contract for ""payment at Bombay against presentation of documents "" means this.
It was the sellers who received the bills of lading and it was on the presentation of these bills of lading along with the invoices that the buyer paid the price.
When the bills of lading though made out as if the goods were shipped by the buyer, were actually obtained and retained by the sellers, that fact itself would ordinarily indicate an intention of 929 the parties that the property in the goods would not pass till after payment.
The second circumstance to which our attention has been drawn is that the export was under the contract to be under the buyer 's export licence.
This, in our opinion, shows nothing.
The ordinary rule in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence.
That was laid down in Brandt 's case (1) and though in a later case in Hardy vs Pound (2) the Court of Appeal in England held that the judgment in Brandt 's case (1) does not cover every FOB contract and that in the special facts of the particular case before them it was for the sellers to obtain the licence and this view was approved by the House of Lords , it is in our opinion correct to state that the presumption in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyers to obtain export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case this duty may fall on the sellers.
The third circumstance on which reliance is placed on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer is that the Export Control Order, 1954, which was passed in the exercise of powers conferred by Import & Export Control Act, 1947, contained a provision in its clause 5(2) in these words: "" It shall be deemed to be a condition of that licence. . . that the goods for the export of which licence is granted shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export "".
It has been strenuously contended by the learned Solicitor General that it will be reasonable to think that the parties to the contract intended to comply with this condition and to agree as between themselves that the goods shall be the property of the licensee, that is, the buyer, at the time of the export.
It is argued that the time of the export should be interpreted as the time when the customs frontier is crossed and that we must proceed on the basis that the buyer and the sellers intended that the goods shall be the buyer 's property at the point of time when they crossed this frontier.
We see however no justification for thinking that in this clause ""the time of the export "" means the time (1) (2) 930 when the goods cross the customs frontier.
Export has been defined in the Import & Export (Control) Act, 1947, as "" taking out of India by sea, land or air "".
In the Exports (Control) Order, 1954, the word must be taken to have the same meaning as in the Act.
On that definition the time of the export is the time when the goods go out of the territorial limits of India.
These territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.
Consequently the time of the export is when the ship with the goods goes be yond the territorial limits.
At any rate, the export of the goods cannot be considered to have commenced before the ship carrying goods leaves the port.
The intention of the parties that in compliance with the requirements of cl.
5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order the goods shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export would therefore mean nothing more than that the property in the goods shall pass immediately before the ship goes beyond the territorial waters of the country, or at the earliest when the ship leaves the port.
Whichever view is taken there is nothing to indicate that the intention to comply with the requirements of el.
5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order carries with it an intention that the property should pass to the buyer at the time the goods cross the customs frontier.
It is true that in the United Motor '8 Case (1) and in other cases it has been held by this Court that the course of export commences to run when the goods cross the customs barrier.
What the court had to consider in these cases was not however when export commences within the meaning of the Exports (Control) Order but when the course of export commences for the purpose of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.
For the reasons which need not be detailed here it was decided that the course of export commences at the time when the goods cross the customs barrier.
These decisions as regards the commencement of the course of export are of no assistance in deciding about the point of time when the export proper commences.
As we have already pointed out when export has been defined in the Import & Export (1) (1953) 4 S.T.C. 133. 931 (Control) Act, 1947, as ""taking out of India by land, sea, or air "", export in the Export Control Order, cannot be held to have commenced till at least the ship carrying the goods has left the port, though it may in some contexts be more correct to say that it does not commence till the ship has passed beyond the territorial waters.
We have therefore come to the conclusion that there is no circumstance which would justify a conclusion that the parties came to a special agreement that though the sales were on FOB contracts property in the goods would pass to the buyer at some point of time before shipment.
We think that the learned judges who heard the appeal in the Bombay High Court were right in their conclusion that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.
In Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 the appellants ' contention is that on a correct interpretation of the provisions of section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act no purchase tax was leviable from them.
Section 10(b) provides for the levy of a purchase tax on the turnover of purchase of goods specified in column I of Schedule B, at the rates, if any, specified against such goods in column 4 of the said schedule, ""where a certificate under cl.
(b) of section 8 has been furnished in respect of such goods and the purchasing dealer does not show to the satisfaction of the Collector that the goods have been despatched by him or by a person to whom he has sold the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by the dealer furnishing such certificate "".
Section 8(b) provides for the deduction from the turnover, of sale of goods to a dealer who holds an authorisation and furnishes to the selling dealer a certificate in the prescribed form declaring inter alia that the goods so sold to him are intended for being despatched by him or by registered dealers to whom he sells the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay.
Admittedly such a certificate was furnished by 932 M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal in respect of the castor oil which they sold to others and that in respect of these sales to them their sellers were allowed deductions.
It is equally undisputed that the persons to whom M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal sold the goods were sent to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal.
These persons are however not registered dealers.
The Sales Tax Officer as also the High Court of Bombay has held that the "" person to whom he has sold the goods "" in section 10(b) means "" a registered dealer to whom he has sold the goods "".
It is contended before us on behalf of the appellant dealers that the word "" a person "" is wide enough to include a registered dealer and an unregistered dealer.
It is urged that the use of the word it a person "" instead of the words "" a registered dealer "" is deliberate and that it was the intention of the Legislature to levy purchase tax on a person who has given such certificate under section 8(b) only if the goods were not 'despatched outside the State of Bombay within the prescribed period by anybody.
It is therefore contended that "" a person "" in section 8(b) should be interpreted to include a registered dealer or anybody else.
We are unable to agree.
A close examination of sections 8 and 10 justifies the conclusion that the Legislature was anxious to secure that the declaration as regards intention of the goods being despatched outside the State of Bombay should be carried out by despatch by "" a registered dealer "" to whom he sells the goods.
If such despatch outside the State of Bombay is by a person to whom the certifying dealer has sold the goods but who is not a registered dealer the certificate has not been complied with.
It will be in our opinion unreasonable to think that though the Legislature insisted that the certificate should declare the goods purchased were intended 11 for being despatched by him or by a registered dealer to whom he sells the goods outside the State of Bombay "", the Legislature would be content to accept actual despatch outside the State of Bombay by one who is not a registered dealer as sufficient.
Mr. Sanyal contended that the certificate 933 has to declare only an intention and that if ultimately the actual despatch is made by some person who is not a registered dealer, it cannot strictly be said that the declaration has not been carried out.
It might very well be that if at the time a declaration of intention is made in the certificate the purchasing dealer had the intention as stated and ultimately he sells to a person who is not a registered dealer for despatch of the goods outside the State of Bombay, the purchasing dealer may not be liable for having made a false declaration "".
Even though he has not made a false declaration of his intention, the fact remains that the intention declared has not been carried out.
The scheme of the Legislature clearly is that where the intention as declared has not been carried out purchase tax should be levied.
To hold otherwise would be to make the declaration of the intention useless.
Our conclusion therefore is that the courts below have rightly interpreted the words "" a person "" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as a "" registered dealer "" and that the purchasing dealers have rightly been assessed to purchase tax under section 10(b).
In the result, both the appeals are dismissed with costs.
Appeals dismissed.
","The respondents firm claimed exemption from Sales Tax under article 286(i)(b) of the Constitution in respect of sales 925 made by them of cotton and castor oil on the ground that the sales were on F.O.B. contracts under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till those crossed the custom barrier and entered the export stream.
They also contested the purchase tax to which they were assessed under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.
The High Court upheld the contention of the respondents regarding the Sales Tax but held that they were liable to pay purchase tax.
On appeal by both the parties Held, that the goods remained the seller 's property till those had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(i) of the Constitution.
The word "" a person "" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act had been correctly interpreted as "" a registered dealer "" and the purchasing dealers had been rightly assessed to purchase tax.
The normal rule in F. 0.
B. contracts was that the property was intended to pass and did pass on the shipment of the goods.
The presumption in F. 0.
B. contracts was that it was the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case that duty might fall on the seller.

H. N. Sanyal,, Additional Solicitor General of India, N. D. Karkhanis and R. N. Sachthey, for the appellant.
701 A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, J. B. Dadachanji, O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the respondents.
October, 23.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.
These a peals pursuant to a certificate of the High Court of Bombay raise the question of interpretation of section 24B of the Income tax Act in an Income tax Reference.
The question referred was answered in the negative and against the Commissioner of Income tax who is the appellant in these appeals, the respondents being the heirs and legal representatives of one Amarchand N. Shroff deceased.
The appeals relate to the assessment years 1950 51, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55.
Shortly stated the facts of the case are these Amarchand N. Shroff, Mangaldas and Hiralal were partners in a firm of solicitors.
Amarchand died on July 7, 1949.
Thereafter the partnership was carried on by Mangaldas and Hiralal up to November 30, 1949, and on December 1, 1949, Ramesh son of Amarchand who had by then qualified as a solicitor joined the firm as the third partner.
After the death of Amarchand the arrangement between the various partners in regard to the realisations of the old outstandings was that in respect of the work done up to the death of Amarchand the realisations were to be divided amongst Amarchand, Mangaldas and Hiralal, in respect of the work between July 8, 1949, and November 30, 1919, the realisations were to be divided between Mangaldas and Hiralal 'and in respect of work done after December 1, 1949, the realisations were to be divided amongst Mangaldas, Hiralal and Ramesh.
The firm kept its accounts on cash basis.
For the five assessment years 1950 51 to 1954 55 the following amounts were received : Rs. 37,847/ , As.
43,162/ , Rs. 34,899/ , Rs. 13,402/ and 702 Rs. 32,523/ by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand out of the outstandings.
The Income tax Officer sought to tax these realisations.
For the assessment years 1950 51 and 1951 52 he assessed the amounts in the hands of the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand as a Hindu undivided family.
Against that order an appeal was taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and then to the Appellate Tribunal.
The two members of the Tribunal agreed in holding, though for different reasons, that the amounts were not the income of the Hindu undivided family but merely represented inheritance or realisations of the assets of Amarchand.
The matter was not pursued further by the Revenue but sometime later proceedings were started by the Income tax Officer under section 34 in respect of the same income in the hands of ""Amarchand N. Shroff by his heirs and legal representatives"".
The status of that entity was taken to be that of an individual and not Hindu undivided family.
The various amounts were assessed to income tax in the hands of the respondents under section 34(1) (b) read with section 24B of the Income tax Act.
The assessments so made were for the assessment years 1950 51, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55: On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that.
the notice under section 34 could validly be served only for the assessment years 1950 51 and notices for the subsequent years were invalid.
The assessments for 1951 52 to 1954 55 were therefore quashed.
The Commissioner of Income tax took an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal and the Tribunal held that assessment could not be made on Amarchand and that section 24B had no application to the income received after the death of Amarchand and that it was capital receipt and not revenue receipt.
The order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was therefore upheld, On the application of the Commissioner of 703 Income tax the following question of law was referred to the High Court : ""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the sums of Rs. 37,847/ , Rs. 43,162/ , Rs. 34,899/ , Rs. 13,402,/ and Rs. 32,523/ were assessable to income tax in the hands of the assessee ""Amarchand N. Shroff by his legal heirs and representatives"" in the five respective years under reference ?"".
The High Court answered the question in the negative.
It held that apart from section 24E of the Income tax Act the amounts were not taxable and that the section had no application to the case.
It was argued by counsel for the Commissioner of Income tax that on a correct interpretation of section 24B the amounts which were received by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand after his death should be deemed by the fiction incorporated in sub section
(1) to be income received by Amarchand and liable to tax under section 24B (1) of the Income tax Act.
In other words the respondents as heirs and legal representatives of the deceased Amarchand were liable to pay out of the estate of the deceased Amarchand on those amounts to the extent of the estate as the estate was liable for tax on the amounts received by the heirs and legal representatives just as the deceased Amarchand would have been had he not died.
The emphasis was on words in section 24B (1) ""or any tax which would have been payable by him under this Act if he had not died"".
Section 24B is as follows : section 24B 11,Tax of deceased person payable by represen tative (1) Where a person dies, his executor, administrator or other legal representative shall be liable to pay out of the estate of the deceased person to the extent to Which the estate 704 is capable of meeting the charge the tax assessed as payable by such person or any tax which would have been payable by him under this Act if he had not died.
(2) Where a person dies before the publication of the notice referred to in sub section (1) of section 22 or before he is served with a notice under sub section (2) of section 22 or section 34, as the case may be, his executor, administrator or other legal representative shall, on the serving of the notice under sub section (2) of section 22 or under section 34, as the case may be, comply therewith and the Income tax Officer may proceed to assess the total income of the deceased person as if such executor, ad ministrator or other legal representative were the assessee.
(3) Where a person dies, without having furnished a return which he has been required to furnish under the provisions of section 22, or having furnished a return which the Income tax Officer has reason to believe to be incorrect or incomplete, the Income tax Officer may make an assessment of the total income of such person and determine the tax payable by him on the basis of such assessment, and for this purpose may by the issue of the,, appropriate notice which would have had to be served upon the deceased person had he survived require any accounts, documents or other evidence which he might under the provisions of sections 22 and 23 have required from the deceased person.
"" Sub section (1) provides that where a person dies his heirs and legal representatives are liable to pay out 705 of the estate of the deceased the tax assessed as payable by the deceased or any tax which would have been payable under the Act by the deceased if he had not died.
According to the 'submission of counsel for the Commissioner of Income tax the words of sub section
(1) ""or any tax which would have been payable by him under this Act if he had not died"" mean that irrespective of the date of ' receipt of income receivable by a person, if the income is received by his heirs and legal representatives after his death, they are liable for payment of the tax just as the deceased would have been liable when the income was received had he been living.
But this interpretation is not in accord with the language used in s.24B. All the sub sections have to be read together.
Sub section (1) can be divided into two parts; (1) where the income of the deceased was assessed before his death and (2) where the income was not so assessed but it would have been liable to tax had he not died.
The second part or the words above quoted when read with sub sections (2) and (3) show that they are confined to cases therein mentioned.
They show that those words also have to be restricted to the income received by the deceased person before his death and to the income received after his death by his heirs and legal representatives but in the previous"" year and which had not been assessed but would have been assessed as income received by him if death had not taken place.
See Allen vs Trehearne(1) where the words ""if he had not died"" were interpreted.
Sub section (2) provides that if a person dies before the publication of the public notice under s.22 (1) or before a notice is served on him under sub sections 2 of section 22 or section 34 then the Income tax Officer may proceed to compute or assess the total income of the deceased person as if the heirs and legal representatives were the assessees Sub section (3) provides that when a person dies before a return is furnished by him under the provisions of section 22 or dies after having furnished the return which the (1) (1938) 22 Tax.
15, 706 Income tax Officer finds incorrect or incomplete then the Income tax Officer can make assessment on the total income of the deceased person and certain other consequences follow but in all the cases enumerated above the language used in sub sections 1, 2 and 3 of s.24B contemplates that the heirs and legal representatives of a deceased person are liable to pay income tax out of his estate (1) where assessment had already been made and (2) where he dies before the assessment but the income was received before his death or by his heirs and legal representatives after his death which occurs during the previous year.
If he dies before the publication of the notice under S.22(1) or before the service under s.22(2) or after the service but before he has furnished a return or filed an incorrect or incomplete return then the Income tax Officer should make an assessment of the total income of such deceased person and determine the tax payable thereupon.
Section 24B does not authorise levy of tax on receipts by the legal representatives of a deceased person in the years of assessment succeeding the year of account being the previous year in which such person died.
Income tax is exigible in reference to a person 's total income of the previous year.
The question before us is whether the income which was received subsequent to the previous year in which Amarchand died is liable to be assessed to income tax under section 24B as his income in the hands of his heirs and legal representatives.
In the present case the accounts were kept on cash basis.
The assessee under the Act has ordinarily to be a living person and cannot be a dead person because his legal personality ceases on his death.
By section 24B the Legal personality of a deceased assessee is extended for the duration of the entire previous year in the course of which he died and therefore the income received by him before his death and that received by his heirs and legal representatives after his death but in that previous 707 year becomes assessable to income tax in the relevant assessment year.
The section was enacted by the Legislature to bring to tax, after his death, income received during his lifetime, and fill up the lacuna which was pointed out by the High Court in Ellis C. Reid vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay(1).
Any income received in the year subsequent to the previous or the account year cannot be called income received by the person deceased.
The provisions of section 24B do not extend to tax liability of the estate of a deceased person beyond the previous or the account year in which that person dies.
In support of his contention counsel for the Commissioner of Income tax relied upon the scheme of the Act as given in Additional Income tax Officer vs E. Alfred(2).
There is nothing said in that case which supports the contention raised by the Commissioner of Income tax.
Reliance was next placed on certain observations in a judgment of the Bombay High Court in re.
B. M. Kamdar(3).
Those observations also are of no assistance to the Commissioner of Income tax, Kania, J., as he then was) there observed that the question whether a particular amount was income or not had nothing to do with the time of its receipt and the question of receipt was material.
only for the purpose of determining whether on that amount tax was to be levied under the Act in the year of assessment.
That was a case where a consulting engineer discontinued his practice as such from February 15, 1938, and he received a sum of money representing the outstanding 'professional fees earned by him prior to the discontinuance of his practice but realised by him during the Calendar year which was the previous year.
The assessee was keeping is accounts on cash basis and he contended that as he had discontinued his profession in the previous year the source had come to an nd and the amounts received by him were not liable to income tax.
It was held that the income was assessable.
The assessee in that case was still alive when the income (1) (2) , 445. (3) [1946] 14 l.
T.R. 10.
708 was received by him and section 24B had no application to the facts of the case.
Counsel also relied on the observations of Derbyshire, C.J., in re Sreemati Usharani Shoudhurani(1).
In that case the managing agent of a limited company died on May 12, 1938.
At the time of his death there was a credit with the company of a sum of money on account of commission earned by him and due to him prior to the date of his death.
This sum was paid after his death in the previous year 1938 39 and was sought to be taxed under section 24B of the Income tax Act.
It was held that this income was taxable.
Derbyshire, C.J., said at p. 205 that the assessee who was the widow had received the salary due to her husband; that the Income tax Officer was entitled to assess the total income of the deceased person as if the legal representatives were the assessees and the amount was liable to tax under section 24B (1), but in that case also the amount was received by the widow in the previous year and it was earned by the deceased during the previous year.
The correct position is that apart from s.24B no assessment can be made in respect of the income of a person after his death.
See Ellis C. Reid vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay(2).
In that case, and that was a case before section 24B was enacted, a person was served with a notice under section 22(2) of the Income tax Act but no return was made within the period specified and he died.
It was held that no assessment could be made under section 23(4) of the Act after his death.
At p.106 it was observed : ""The is to be noticed that there is through the Act no reference to the decease of a person on whom the tax has been originally charged, and it is very difficult to suppose the omission to have been unintentional It must have (1) (2) 709 been present to the mind of the legislature that whatever privileges the payment of income tax may confer, the privilege of immortality is not amongst them.
Every person liable to pay tax must necessary die and, in practically every case, before the last instalment has been collected, and the legislature has not chosen to make any provisions expressly dealing with assessment of, or recovering payment from the estate of a deceased person"".
The individual assessee has ordinarily to be a living person and there can be no assessment on a dead person and the assessment is a charge in respect of the income of the previous year and not a charge in respect of the income of the year of assessment as measured by the income of the previous year.
Wallace Brothers & Co. Ltd. v Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay City(2).
By section 24B the legal representatives have, by fiction of law, become assessees as provided in that section but that fiction cannot be extended beyond the object for which it was enacted.
As was observed by this Court in Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. vs The State of Bihar(2) legal fictions are only for a definite purpose and they are limited to the purpose for which they are created and should not be extended beyond that legitimate: field.
In the present case the fiction is limited to the cases provided in the three subsections of section 24B and cannot be extended further than the liability for the income received in the previous year.
In the present case the amounts which are sought to be taxed and which have been held not to be liable to tax are those which were not received in the previous year and are therefore not liable to tax in the several years of assessment.
It cannot be said that they were income which may be deemed by fiction to have been received by the dead person and therefore they are not liable to be taxed as income (1) , 244.
(2) , 664.
710 of the deceased Amarchand and are not liable to be taxed in the hands of the heirs and legal representatives who cannot be deemed to be assessees for the purpose of assessment in regard to those years.
In our view the High Court rightly answered the question in the negative and against the Commissioner of Income tax.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed with costs.
Appeals dismissed.
","Sub section (1) of section 24B of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, provided that where a person dies his heirs and legal representatives ate liable to pay out of the estate of the deceased the tax assessed as payable by the deceased or any tax which would have been payable under the Art by the deceased if he had not died.
A who, was one of the three partners in a firm of solicitors died.
on July 7,1949, and thereafter the partnership was carried on by the other two partners till December 1, 1949.
when R, son of A, joined the firm as the third partner.
After the death of A the arrangement between the various partners in regard to the ' realisations of the old out standings was that in respect of the work done up to the death of A the realisations were to be divided between A and the other two partners.
The firm 700 kept its accounts on cash basis For each of the five assessment years, 1950 1955, certain amounts were received by the heirs and legal representatives of A out of the out standings.
Proceedings were started by the Income tax Officer under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, in respect of the aforesaid.
income, and the various amounts were assessed to income tax in the hands of the respondents, the heirs and legal representatives of A, under section 34 (1) (b) read with section 24B of the Act, for the five respective assessment years, on the footing that the amounts which were received by the heirs and legal representatives of A after his death should be deemed by virtue of the words in sub section
(1) of section 24B to be income received by A and liable to tax under that sub section.
Held, that the words ""or any tax which would have been payable by him under this Act if he had not died"" under section 24B(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, are restricted to the income received by the deceased person before his death and to the income received after his death by his heirs and legal representatives in the ""previous year"" and which had not been assessed but would have been assessed as income received by him, if death had not taken place.
The provisions of section 24B do not extend to tax liability of the estate of a deceased person beyond the previous or the account year in which that person dies.
Apart from section 24B no assessment can be made in respect of the income of a person after his death.
Held, that as the income was received after the expiry of the previous year in which A died it was not liable to be taxed as the income of A in the hands of his legal representatives in the several years of assessment.

2649,"Appeal No. 949 of 1966.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 11, 1964 of the Madras High Court in Tax Case No. 181 of 1962.
M. C. Chagla and B. R. Agarwala, for the appellant.
section T. Desai, R. N. Sachthey and B. D. Sharma, for the respondent.
[The appeal was originally heard by J. C. Shah, Ag.
C.J., V. Ramaswami and A. N. Grover, JJ.
The case was twice re manded to the Tribunal.
The first Order of the Court remanding the case to the Tribunal was delivered by] Shah, Ag. C. J. M/s Amarchand Sobhachand 'a firm registered under the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, carried on business at Madras in drugs, chemicals, mercury, camphor and silk yam and as money lenders.
There were two partners of the firm Mohanlal Sagmal and Seshmal Sobhachand, and Ramniklal and Lakshmichand minors were admitted to the benefits of the partnership, each with 7/32 share in the profits.
The appellants had for a long time business relations with a firm styled ""Bhojaji Sobhachand"" carrying on business at Bombay as importers of yam and also as agents and adathias.
Sobhachand, one of the partners of Bhojaji Sobhachand with 16% share in the profit and loss is the father of Seshmal, Ramniklal and Lakshmichand, partners of the appellants.
In the books of account of the appellants which were main tained according to the mercantile, system there was a current sarafi account in respect of their transactions with the Bombay firm in which were credited the funds transmitted from Bombay in respect of their business transactions.
Entries relating to interest were posted till the end of Samvat Year 2006 in the account on the amount due at the foot of the account.
The following is a table showing the balances at the end of the Samvat years 2003 Amount Interest At the end of the Samvat Year 2003 Cr.16,951 00 2004 Dr.1,02,188 4 5Dr.

in the return of income for the assessment year 1953 54 the appellants claimed allowance for Rs. 2,68,385/ due from the Bombay firm at the foot of their running account as a bad debt written off as irrecoverable.
The Income tax Officer disallowed their claim holding that : ""these transactions were mere accommodations which can have no bearing to the regular business carried on by the assessee.
"" The Appellate Assistant Commissioner agreed with the Income tax Officer.
He held that the debt .
did not arise, in the course of the appellants ' business as chemists and druggists nor in the course of their money lending business.
The Income tax Appellate Tribunal accordingly confirmed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
The assessee firm then applied to the Tribunal to refer the following question to the High Court of Madras ""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the disallowance of the bad debt of Rs. 2,68,385 is right in law ?"" The Tribunal rejected the application, but pursuant to an order made by the High Court of, Madras under section 66(2) submitted a statement of the case on the following question ""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the debt of Rs. 2,68,385/ was not one incurred in the course of money lending business of the assessee ?"" In the opinion of the High Court the debt of Rs. 2,68,385/ due to the appellants was not a bad and doubtful debt in its money lending business not a debt representing loss sustained in the other business.
The question referred was, therefore, answered in the affirmative and against the appellants.
Section 10(2) (xi) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as in force at the relevant time provided : ""(2) Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances, namely : (xi) When the assessee 's accounts in respect of any part of his business, profession or vocation are not kept on the cash basis, such sum, in respect of bad and doubtful debts, due to the assessee in 807SupCI/71 418 respect of that part of his business, profession or vocation, and in the case of an assessee carrying on a banking or money lending business, such sum in respect of loans made in the ordinary course of such business as the Income tax Officer may estimate to be irrecoverable but not exceeding the amount actually written off as irrecoverable in the books of the assessee, Provided. . . . . "" Clause (xi) was in two parts.
A bad and doubtful debt due to the taxpayer, written off as irrecoverable in the books of account was properly allowable in computing the taxable profits from business, profession or vocation, where accounts were not kept on the cash basis, if the debt was in respect of a loan made in the course of the taxpayer 's business as a banker or money lender, or when the taxpayer was carrying on any other business the debt was in respect of that other business.
debt written off relying upon both the branches of section 10 (2) (xi) and by the application under section 66(1) of the Income tax Act a question covering both the branches of the section was also sought to be raised.
But the question on which the Tribunal was called upon to state the case was in form imprecise and in import somewhat vague.
A bad and doubtful debt due to an assessee in respect of banking or money lending business is allowable under section 10(2) (xi) if it is in respect of loans made in the ordinary course of such business.
A bad and doubtful debt in respect of a business other than banking or money lending is allowable even if it is not in respect of loan : but a debt due in the course of the business of a money lending is not allowable unless it is, in respect of loans made in the ordinary course of his business.
We are of the view that the question should have been referred in the form suggested by the appellants in their application under section 66(1) with appropriate variations.
In the interest of justice, we direct that the question be reframed as follows : ""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal erred in disallowing the debt of Rs. 2,68,385/ written off by the assessee in their books of account as irrecoverable.
"" The two branches of the question as reframed then are (1) Whether the debt or any part thereof is in respect of loans made 419 in the ordinary course of money lending business of the appellants; and (2) whether the debt or any part thereof is in respect of the other business of the appellants.
We are of the view that before the question may be answered, it is necessary to call for a supplementary statement of the case from the Tribunal.
The Tribunal 's order is very brief : it gives no reasons in support of the conclusions.
The argument based on the first part of section 10(2) (xi) that the debts were due in respect of the business of the appellants other than money lending was not considered at all, and the Tribunal disposed of the second part of the case by merely observing that it was an ""accommodation"" account to enable the Bombay firm to tide over the ""financial crisis"" threatening it in Samvat Year 2007, and that the trans actions in the account were totally unconnected with the normal business of the appellants.
An ""accommodation"" advance is a neutral expression : it may be of the nature of a loan advanced in the ordinary course of business by a money lender; it may be an advance the money lending or other business of the assessee but not in the nature of a loan; or it may be wholly unrelated to the business of the tax payer.
The statement submitted by the Tribunal is also inadequate.
It contains only a summary of the business relations between.
the appellants and the Bombay firm, a statement as to the amounts due at the end of each year at the foot of the account, the interest if any charged and a summary of the orders made by the Income tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal.
The statement of the case does not analyse the evidence and throws no light upon the two branches of the argument raised before the Tribunal and which, in our view, arose out of the question on which they were required to submit a statement of the case.
Counsel for the Revenue, however, contended that there are three important circumstances which appear from the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Income tax Officer from which it may be inferred that the advances made by the appellants to the Bombay firm were not in respect of loans in the ordinary course of the business of the appellants, nor in respect of their other business.
Counsel said that (1) Sobhagchand Amarchand partner of the Bombay firm is the father of Seshmal one of the partners of the appellants and of the minors Ramniklal and Lakshmichand who are admitted to the benefits of partnership; (2) that large amounts of money were advanced shortly before the Bombay firm closed its business; and (3) that there was a consistant practice for paying or receiving interest on the 420 amounts due at the, foot of the account, but no interest was charged by the appellants in respect of the dues at the foot of the account at the end of Samvat Years 2007 and 2008.
But the Tribunal has not raised any inference from these circumstances and has merely observed that charging of interest cannot make it a money lending account.
We, therefore, direct that the Income tax Appellate Tribunal do submit a supplementary statement of the case on the, question reframed, on both the branches of section 10(2)(xi) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922.
The Tribunal will give opportunity to both the parties of being heard, but will restrict themselves to the ,evidence on the record.
The supplementary statement to be submitted within three months from the date the papers reach the Tribunal.
[After receipt of the supplementary statement of case from the Tribunal the appeal was heard by J. C. Shah, K. section Hegde and A. N. Grover, JJ.
The order of the Court was delivered by] Shah, J.
By our order dated July 29, 1969 we called for the light of the two branches of section 10(2) (xi) of the Indian In come tax Act, 1922.
We have now received a statement of case from the Tribunal.
The Tribunal has set out in great detail the arguments advanced before it by the assessee and by the Revenue but it has not set out the facts found by it from the evidence on the record in the light of the arguments advanced.
The statement of case is intended to be a finding on facts and not a catalogue of the arguments advanced at the Bar.
Since the Tribunal has not found the facts we are constrained to send back the case again to the Tribunal for submitting to this Court a supplementary statement on facts found by the Tribunal.
The Tribunal will submit the statement within three months from the date on which the papers reach the Tribunal.
[After receipt of the second supplementary statement of case from the Tribunal the appeal was finally heard by J. C. Shah, C.J., K. section Hegde and A. N. Grover, JJ.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered 'by] Hegde, J.
The appellant firm (which will hereinafter be referred to as the ""assessee"") carried on business in drugs, chemicals, mercury, camphor and art silk yam as also in money lending, over a number of years.
The accounting year with which we are concerned in this appeal is Samvat year 2008 commencing from October 31, 1951 and ending on Oct. 18, 1952.
The firm 421 consisted of two partners, Mohanlal Baginal and Sashmal Sobha Chand.
Two minors, Ramniklal Sobhachand and Lakshmichand Sobhachand were admitted to the benefits of the partnership.
The assessee had dealings for several years with a firm known as ""Bhojaji Sobhachand"" (to be hereinafter referred to as the Bombay firm).
Sobhachand Amarchand, a partner of the Bombay firm, is the father of Seshmal, Ramaniklal and Lakshmichand and he was having sixteen percent share in the Bombay firm.
That firm became insolvent in April 1952.
The Bombay firm owed certain amount to the assessee.
In the assessment of income tax of the appellant for the assessment year 1952 53, relevant to the account year Samvat 2008, the assessee claimed a deduction of Rs. 2,68,385/ as bad debt due from the Bombay firm, incurred by that firm in the course of business transactions.
The Incometax Officer disallowed that claim holding that ""these transactions were mere accommodations which can have no bearing to the regular business carried on by the assessee.
In, appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner agreed with the Income tax Officer.
He held that the debt did not arise in the course of the assessee 's business as Chemists and Druggists nor in the course of their money lending business.
On a further appeal taken by, the assessee to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal, the tribunal confirmed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. 'The assessee thereafter applied to the tribunal under section 66(1) of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922 to submit a statement of the case with the question ""whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the disallowance of the bad debt of Rs. 2,68,385/ is right in law"" to the High Court of Madras for its opinion.
The tribunal rejected that application but pursuant to an order of the High Court under section 66(2), the tribunal submitted a statement of the case on the following question ""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the debt of Rs. 2,68,385/ was not one incurred in the course of money lending business of the assessee."" The High Court opined that the debt in question was not a bad and doubtful debt in the assessee 's money lending business nor a debt representing loss sustained in the other business.
The question referred was, therefore, answered in the affirmative and against the asses see.
Thereafter the present appeal was brought after obtaining special leave from this Court.
At the hearing of the appeal this Court found that the tribunal 's order was very brief and that it gave no reasons in support of its conclusions.
It also found that the statement submitted by the tribunal was in adequate.
This Court took the view that the question framed at 422 the instance of the High Court did not bring out the real question arising for decision.
It accordingly .
reframed the question as follows ""Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Appellate Tribunal erred in disallowing a sum of Rs. 2,68,385/ written off by the assessee in their books of accounts as irrecoverable ?"" By its order dated July 29, 1969 this Court called upon the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the reframed question.
The tribunal accordingly submitted a fresh statement of the case on the question referred.
But that statement merely catalogued the arguments advanced at the bar.
The tribunal did not give any findings on the points arising for decision.
Hence by its order dated April 7, 1970, this Court directed the tribunal to submit a further statement.
The tribunal has accordingly submitted a further statement.
The facts found by the tribunal are found in paragraphs 11 ;and 12 of the statement.
They read : "" 11.
We have taken into consideration the available materials and the rival submissions.
The only facts in favour of the assessee are that incidental charges are debited to the Bombay firm in respect of some of the remittances and there is a flow of moneys to the Bombay firm up to 10 3 1952 when the last of the remittances was sent to it before the firm collapsed in about April 1952.
On the other hand, the narrations in the entries, as they stand, the failure to adjust interest in the account of the Bombay firm at the stage at which it became a debtor in Samvat year 2007, the manner in which the partner of the appellant firm tried to explain the position in March, 1954 and the stand of the firm itself at all earlier stages support the case of the Department."" ""12.
Having considered all the circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that the sums in question were not sent to the Bombay firm as loans made in the ordinary course of the money lending business of the assessee nor in respect of any other business of the assessee.
As this is the finding with regard to the whole of the amount of Rs. 2,68,385/ there is no question of ,#locating any portion thereof as between the business of money lending or for any other purpose as preferred to para 7 above.
"" 423 It is true as contended by the learned Counsel for the asstssee that the conclusions reached by the tribunal are not supported by proper discussion of the material before it.
It is also true that the tribunal after catalogueing the arguments advanced at the bar, has come to certain abrupt conclusions, but all the tame it cannot be denied that the findings reached by the tribunal are findings of fact and those findings are supported by the evidence on record.
The tribunal has found that the monies sent by the assessee to the Bombay firm were not loans made in the ordinary course of its money lending business, nor in respect of any other business of the assessee.
This finding covers the entire amount sought to be deducted.
In view of this finding, which is binding on this Court, our answer to the question reframed has to be in the negative and in favour of the Department.
The appeal fails and is dismissed.
No costs.
G.C. Appeal dismissed.
","The appellants we 're a registered partnership firm engaged in money lending business as well as business in certain chemical goods, and silk yarn.
Another firm had a current account with the appellants between the samvat years 2003 and 2008.
At the end of the latter year the said account had a debit balance of Rs. 268385 1 3.
In the return of income for the assessment year 1953 54 the appellants claimed allowance for the said sum of Rs. 268385 as a bad debt written off as irrecoverable.
The claim was disallowed by the authorities under the Income tax Act, 1922.
The Tribunal referred to the High Court under section 66(2) of the Income tax Act, 192Z the question whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal 's finding that the sum in question did not relate to the appellants money lending business was correct.
The High Court answered the question in the affirmative against the appellants.
This Court in appeal by special leave re framed the question to be answered by the Tribunal so as to cover not only the money lending business of the appellants but also the business in chemicals etc.
The Court directed the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case.
The supplementary statement of case submitted by the Tribunal was however found unsatisfactory in as much as it contained a summary of arguments on both sides but no findings on the,facts of the case.
Hence supplementary statement on 'facts was called for.
The findings given by the Tribunal were against the appellants.
On the contention that the conclusion reached by the Tribunal was not supported by proper discussion of the materials before it, HELD : The findings reached by the Tribunal were findings of fact and those findings were supported by the evidence on record.
The Tribunal had found that the loans were not made in the course of money lending business of the assessee nor in respect of any other business of the assessee.
This finding covered the entire amount sought to be deducted.
In view of this finding which was binding on this Court, the answer to the question re framed had to be in favour of the department.
[423 B] Also held : (i) The Tribunal in submitting its statement,of case must give not only the facts of the case or the arguments of parties but also its own findings on the, facts and evidence.
[410 D] (ii) When the assessee had money lending as well as other business, its claim for a bad debt under section 10 (2) (xi) of the Act must be considered in relation to both the businesses and the question submitted by the Tribunal must cover the claim in both its aspects.

"
uksc-2018-0030,"This is an application by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland to refer to this court what is claimed to be a devolution issue.
The reference is made under paragraph 34 of Schedule 10 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
In material part it provides: the Attorney General for Northern Ireland may refer to the Supreme Court any devolution issue which is not the subject of proceedings.
By virtue of paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 10, a devolution issue includes a question whether a purported or proposed exercise of a function by a Minister or Northern Ireland department is, or would be, invalid by reason of section 24 of the 1998 Act.
And section 24, among other things, provides (in subsection 1(a)) that a Minister or Northern Ireland department has no power to make, confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, or to do any act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with any of the rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
By the Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 (Commencement No 8 and Transitional and Transitory Provisions) Order 2017, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions commenced a number of universal credit provisions for claims on or after 27 September 2017 where the claimant resides in an area known as No 1 relevant districts.
Although it is for the Secretary of State to appoint the dates for commencement, he does so by a legislative technique which, the Attorney General contends, requires action by the Northern Ireland Department for Communities, which is one of the Northern Ireland ministerial departments.
The 2017 Order defines the No 1 relevant districts as the postcodes specified in the table in the List of the No 1 Relevant Districts.
It is the Department for Communities which must issue such lists.
The same holds true for a second order made by the Secretary of State relating to No 3 relevant districts and No 2 relevant districts.
The commencement order was drafted so that Universal Credit could come into effect if the Department published a list of postcodes, which postcodes together make up the district within which the benefit will commence.
The basis for the Attorneys reference is his assertion that the universal credit provisions in question breach articles 8, 12 and 14 of the ECHR and article 1 of the first protocol to the ECHR and are therefore invalid per section 24 of the 1998 Act.
The Attorney General submits that a devolution issue arises because the provision of lists by the Department for Communities is necessary in order to give effect to the Secretary of States commencement orders.
The Department refutes this, contending that its role in issuing the relevant lists amounts to nothing more than providing administrative support to the Secretary of State.
The commencement orders define the relevant territories by reference to lists of postcodes issued by the Department.
The lists were not prepared, however, pursuant to any statutory or other power and do not have any independent legal force or effect, the Department says.
They are incorporated by reference into the commencement orders and therefore have legal effects solely by reason of the act of the Secretary of State, not the act of the Department.
Discussion
Acts by the Secretary of State or by departments in Westminster do not come within the purview of section 24 of the 1998 Act.
In order for a devolution issue to arise, therefore, it must be shown that an act has been carried out or a function has been discharged by a Northern Ireland Minister or a Northern Ireland department.
Section 1(1) of the Northern Ireland (Welfare Reform) Act 2015 stated that
Her Majesty could make provision for, inter alia, social security and child support maintenance in Northern Ireland by way of an Order in Council.
Section 1(2) stipulated that such an Order in Council could confer power on the Secretary of State or a Northern Ireland department to make regulations relating to such payments.
The Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 was made on 9 December 2015, pursuant to the 2015 Act.
Article 4 provides that until such date as appointed by the Secretary of State, a function conferred on a Northern Ireland department under the 2015 Order to make Regulations for social security and child support maintenance is to be exercised by the Secretary of State rather than by the Northern Ireland department.
It also provides that any statutory provision relating to social security and child support maintenance may be exercised by the Secretary of State (as well as by the Northern Ireland department otherwise entitled to exercise the function).
These provisions were deemed to be necessary because of disagreements over welfare reform among the Northern Ireland political parties.
They were important, the department argued, because they concentrated the power to make regulations relating to welfare provision in the office of the Secretary of State.
Actions taken by the Secretary of State could not constitute devolution issues.
On one view, it would be anomalous that the provision of lists of postcodes, something entirely ancillary to the introduction of the welfare provision reforms, could be used as a hook on which to hang the argument that a devolution issue arose.
The contrary view is that the provision of postcodes was indispensable to the effective introduction of the welfare reforms.
Without them, the commencement orders could not operate.
Conceivably, they could have been compiled by a Westminster department which would have rendered the act of preparing the lists immune from challenge as a devolution issue.
But, in fact, they were not.
A Northern Ireland department prepared the lists.
Their existence was integral to the operation of the welfare reforms.
The act of preparing the lists and providing them to the Secretary of State constituted an act for the purpose of section 24 of the 1998 Act.
It is, I believe, important to recognise that the distinct prohibitions in section 24 are disjunctive.
Thus, it is forbidden to make, confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, or to do any act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights.
The section comprehends, therefore, not only the enactment of subordinate legislation but also acts which may be ancillary or even incidental to that enactment.
On a theoretical or technical level, therefore, the compiling of lists of postcodes and providing them as a means of facilitating the introduction of the commencement orders is an act or the discharge of a function under paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 10 to the 1998 Act.
Matters do not end there, however.
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 10 to the 1998 Act provides that a devolution issue shall not be taken to arise in any proceedings merely because of any contention of a party to the proceedings which appears to the court or tribunal before which the proceedings take place to be frivolous or vexatious.
It would be wrong to characterise the Attorneys application for a reference as frivolous or vexatious but it would be equally wrong to lose sight of two important and correlated aspects to the application.
First, the application is not principally directed at the act of preparing the postcode lists on the basis that that act was incompatible with the ECHR.
The avowed incompatibility is said to depend on its being shown that the introduction of Universal Credit is not compatible with the ECHR.
The gravamen of the charge is not to the mode of introduction of the measure but to its impact.
In Attorney General for Northern Irelands Reference [2019] UKSC 1, this court held that where precisely the same issue as the Attorney sought to refer to this court as a devolution issue arose in pending proceedings in Northern Ireland, it was not appropriate to accept the reference.
This court must retain a discretion whether to deal with a reference on a devolution issue where that issue is to be raised in proceedings where the actual claimed incompatibility of the measure occupies centre stage, as opposed to its appearance via a side wind as here.
And it is, of course, the case that this issue will come before this court on appeal from a decision of the English Court of Appeal (R (C) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2019] EWCA Civ 615; [2019] 1 WLR 5687) which is due to be heard on 20 22 October 2020.
It will be open to the Attorney to apply to intervene in that appeal.
This leads to the second reason for refusing to accept the reference.
The fundamental underpinning of the Attorneys case is that the introduction of Universal Credit in Northern Ireland is incompatible with the ECHR.
It is not that a means of identifying the areas where it is to be introduced sequentially was incompatible.
In this connection a passage from Reed and Murdoch: Human Rights Law in Scotland, 4th ed (2017) is instructive.
At para 1.148 the authors state: Although the term act has been given a wide construction, there remains the critical question whether the act is incompatible with the Convention rights. what is meant by incompatible has proved to be a difficult question.
Although it has been said on a number of occasions that the essence of the word incompatible is that there is an inconsistency between one thing and another, that explanation does not resolve all the difficulties that have arisen.
Whether an act is inconsistent with a Convention right may not be obvious: it may not depend on a but for causal test or involve a remoteness test (ie whether any infringement of Convention rights will be the direct or proximate result of the act under challenge).
Other approaches have been to ask whether the act under challenge is precluded by the Convention right in question, or whether the act involves an infringement of the Convention right.
The latter formulations have the advantage of requiring analysis of the precise bearing of the Convention right, as understood in the Strasbourg and domestic jurisprudence, on the specific act under challenge, rather than falling back on concepts, such as those of causation or remoteness, borrowed from other areas of domestic law.
The relative isolation of the act (in this case the compilation and the provision of the postcode lists) from the actual introduction of Universal Credit in the areas covered by them throws into stark relief the inappropriateness of regarding the preparation of the lists as an act sufficient to give rise to a devolution issue.
Conclusion
I would therefore refuse to accept the Attorneys application to refer this issue to the court under paragraph 34 of Schedule 10 to the 1998 Act.
","This is an application by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland under paragraph 34 of Schedule 10 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (the 1998 Act).
Paragraph 34 provides that the Attorney General may refer to the Supreme Court any devolution issue which is not the subject of proceedings.
A devolution issue includes a question whether a purported exercise of a function by a Northern Ireland Department is or would be invalid by reason of section 24 of the 1998 Act. section 24(1)(a) provides that a Department of Northern Ireland has no power to make, confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, or to do any act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with any of the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR).
By the Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 (Commencement no. 8 and Transitional and Transitory Provisions) Order 2017, the Secretary of State commenced a number of universal credit provisions for claims on or after 27 September 2017 where the claimant resides in an area known as no. 1 relevant districts.
Although it is for the Secretary of State to appoint the dates for commencement, he does so by a legislative technique which requires action by the Northern Ireland Department for Communities (part of the Northern Ireland Executive).
The 2017 Order defines the no. 1 relevant districts as the postcodes specified in the table in the List of the no. 1 Relevant Districts.
It is the Department for Communities which must issue such lists.
The same holds true of a second order made by the Secretary of State relating to no. 3 relevant districts and no. 2 relevant districts.
The basis for the Attorney Generals reference is his assertion that the universal credit provisions in question breach Article 1 Protocol 1, Articles 8, 14 and 12 of the ECHR and are therefore invalid per section 24 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
The Attorney General submits that the provision of lists by the Department for Communities is necessary in order to give effect to the Secretary of States commencement orders and thus constitutes an act, per section 24 of the 1998 Act, which is incompatible with the ECHR and invalid.
It is for this reason that the Attorney General submits that the publication of lists by the Department for Communities raises a devolution issue under Schedule 10 of the 1998 Act.
The Department for Communities refutes this, contending that the provisions under challenge concentrated the power to make welfare provision in the office of the Secretary of State.
The Department for Communities submits that its role in issuing the lists amounts to nothing more than providing administrative support to the Secretary of State, and that the lists have legal effects solely by reason of the act of the Secretary of State, not the act of the Department.
The publication of lists is not, therefore, an act raising a devolution issue under section 24 of the 1998 Act.
The Supreme Court unanimously refuses to accept the Attorney Generals application to refer this issue to the court under paragraph 34 of Schedule 10 to the 1998 Act.
Lord Kerr, with whom Lady Hale and Lord Reed agree, gives the judgment.
The Court notes that acts by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland or by departments in Westminster do not come within the purview of section 24 of the 1998 Act.
For a devolution issue to arise, it must be shown that an act or function has been carried out by a Northern Ireland minister or department, and that the act in question is invalid by reason of section 24 [6].
The prohibitions in section 24 are disjunctive: it is forbidden to make, confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, or to do any act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with the ECHR.
Acts ancillary to the enactment of subordinate legislation are thus in principle capable of being caught by section 24.
It is therefore possible, on a theoretical or technical level, to consider that the Departments provision of the postcode lists in question amounts to such an ancillary act [11].
There are, however, two reasons that the provision of such lists cannot be said to raise a devolution issue.
First, as the Court held in AGNIs reference [2019] UKSC 1, where the Attorney General sought to refer to this court a devolution issue that arose in parallel pending proceedings, it was considered not to be appropriate to accept the reference.
The same holds true here: a challenge to the universal credit provisions will come before this court shortly on appeal from a decision of the English Court of Appeal.
It will be open to the Attorney General to apply to intervene in that appeal [12].
Second, the fundamental underpinning of the Attorney Generals case is that the introduction of universal credit in Northern Ireland by act of the Secretary of State is incompatible with the ECHR.
It is not that the Departments act in identifying the areas where universal credit is to be introduced that is incompatible.
The publication of the lists itself is not an act sufficient to give rise to an incompatibility with the ECHR.
For a devolution issue under Schedule 10 to arise, it must be shown that the departmental act under challenge is capable of being incompatible with the ECHR.
Because the publication of lists is not in itself capable of giving rise to an incompatibility, it is not appropriate to accept a reference under paragraph 34 [13 14].
"
uksc-2014-0023,"The appellant brought a claim for judicial review of a decision of the respondent, on 21 February 2012, to approve a Revenue Budget for 2012/13 in relation to the provision of youth services.
In his claim form he applied for declarations that the respondent had failed to comply with section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 and section 507B of the Education Act 1996 and for an order quashing the decision to approve the budget.
The claim was dismissed at first instance (Wyn Williams J) and the appellant was ordered to pay the respondents costs, subject to a proviso against enforcement of the order without further permission of the court.
He obtained limited permission to appeal on two grounds.
The Court of Appeal (Moore Bick, Rimer and Underhill LJJ) decided the two substantive issues in his favour but did not grant him any relief, dismissed his appeal and ordered him to pay half of the respondents costs of the appeal.
This appeal is about the form of the Court of Appeals disposal of the matter.
The appellant submits that since the court held that the respondent had failed in its statutory obligations, it should have made a declaration to that effect and should have made an order for costs in his favour.
The underlying facts and issues are set out in the very thorough judgment of Wyn Williams J, [2012] EWHC 1928 (Admin), and recapitulated, so far as was necessary, in the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Rimer LJ, [2013] EWCA Civ 1320.
For present purposes a briefer outline will be sufficient.
The appellant was born on 17 April 1991.
He suffers from ADHD and has other difficulties.
He was therefore a qualifying young person within the meaning of section 507B of the 1996 Act, which required the respondent, so far as reasonably practicable, to secure access for him to sufficient educational and recreational leisure time activities for the improvement of his well being.
Section 507B(9)(b) required the respondent in exercising its functions under that section to secure that the views of qualifying young persons in the authoritys area are taken into account.
The appellants disability was also a protected characteristic which brought into play, in relation to him, the public sector equality duty (PSED) contained in section 149 of the 2010 Act.
The section required the respondent to have due regard to the statutory equality needs in the exercise of its functions.
By its decision on 21 February 2012 the respondent approved a reduction in its youth services budget for 2012/13 of 364,793.
The appellant was concerned about the impact which this was likely to have on the provision of services for young persons with disabilities and, in particular, on a weekly youth club for vulnerable young people which he used to attend.
At first instance wide ranging criticisms were made of the way in which the respondent had reached its decision.
They were all rejected.
At the end of the hearing and before giving judgment, the judge asked counsel for written submissions on relief if he found that there had been illegality.
The note on relief provided by Mr David Wolfe QC and Ms Aileen McColgan on behalf of the appellant stated that he asked for a quashing order.
No mention was made of alternative relief in the form of a declaration.
Ms Jane Oldham noted the omission in her response on behalf of the respondent, observing that it appears that no declaratory relief is sought and D takes it that the claim for declaratory relief [in the claim form] is abandoned, since otherwise C would, in response to the request of Wyn Williams J, have set out the terms of any declaratory relief sought.
Mr Wolfe and Ms McColgan provided a written reply which again made no reference to asking for declaratory relief.
In view of the judges rejection of the challenges to the legality of the respondents approval of the budget, the question of relief did not arise for decision, but the judge rejected an argument by the respondent that the provisions of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 would have prevented him from quashing the decision to approve the budget.
He said that if he had been persuaded that the respondent had acted unlawfully, it would have been open to him to grant any remedy which was appropriate.
The grounds on which the appellant was given leave to appeal were that the respondent had failed in its equality duty (PSED) under section 149, because although equality impact assessments (EIAs) had been carried out relating to the impact of the budgetary cuts, the EIAs had not been provided to the members who took the decision (and the judge had been wrong to infer that the members had read them merely because they had been told how they could be accessed); and that it had failed in its consultation duty under section 507B(9)(b) because there was no evidence of consultation with young people before making the decision to cut the budget (as distinct from meetings with management committees of young peoples organisations to explain to them where the axe would fall).
These grounds were developed in the appellants skeleton arguments in the Court of Appeal.
As to relief, it was submitted that the decision under challenge should be quashed.
No alternative submission was made about declaratory relief.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was given on 6 November 2013.
The court upheld the appellants argument under section 149.
It expressed some doubt about whether section 507B(9) was applicable, but this was not disputed by the respondent.
Accordingly the court proceeded on the assumption (but without deciding) that the section was applicable, and on that assumption it upheld the appellants argument.
However, the court refused to make the quashing order which was sought.
Rimer LJ said that although in theory a quashing order could be made, the court could not see how this could be done without quashing the respondents decision to approve the entire revenue budget for the financial year 2012/13, which had expired nearly three months before the appeal was heard.
He concluded: 94.
It is now too late to unwind what has been done.
Judicial review is a discretionary remedy and, even though we have accepted the substantive points which Mr Hunt has advanced, we are of the firm view that he ought not to be granted the quashing order for which he asks.
To do so would be detrimental to good administration. 95.
We refuse to grant any relief to Mr Hunt and therefore dismiss the appeal.
No mention was made in the judgment about whether the order should include a declaration to reflect what was said in it about the respondents failure to discharge its statutory obligations, no doubt because the subject had never been raised on behalf of the appellant and in any event it would be open to counsel to make suggestions as to the appropriate form of order in the light of the matters determined in the judgement.
It would have also have been open to counsel to raise the matter of declaratory relief on receiving the judgment in draft if it was something which they had meant to raise.
Counsel for the appellant did neither.
Counsel for the respondent prepared a draft order stating that the appeal was dismissed, and counsel for the appellant stated in written submissions that the parties were agreed on the order except in relation to costs.
I would reject the appellants complaint that the Court of Appeal was wrong not to make a declaration of its own initiative.
The complaint is redolent of hindsight.
It is no doubt triggered by the courts decision on costs, but they are separate matters.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal itself ruled that the respondent acted unlawfully, and the authority of the judgment would be no greater or less by making or not making a declaration in the form of the order to the same effect.
However, in circumstances where a public body has acted unlawfully but where it is not appropriate to make a mandatory, prohibitory or quashing order, it will usually be appropriate to make some form of declaratory order to reflect the courts finding.
In some cases it may be sufficient to make no order except as to costs; but simply to dismiss the claim when there has been a finding of illegality is likely to convey a misleading impression and to leave the claimant with an understandable sense of injustice.
That said, there is no must about making a declaratory order, and if a party who has the benefit of experienced legal representation does not seek a declaratory order, the court is under no obligation to make or suggest it.
The appellant is on much stronger ground in relation to costs.
The submissions to the Court of Appeal on his behalf made no reference to the costs at first instance, and it was remiss to agree to an order that the appeal should be dismissed, when there were obvious grounds for arguing that in relation to costs the judges order should be set aside and replaced by an order in the appellants favour.
However, in relation to the costs in the Court of Appeal, the points were properly made that the appellant had succeeded on both the issues as to the respondents statutory duty; that there were wider lessons for local authorities to learn from the case about their duties under each of the relevant sections; that the lapse of time, as a result of which the relevant financial year had now passed, was not the fault of the appellant; and that to deny the appellant his costs would be likely in practice to dissuade claimants from pursuing legitimate public law challenges.
The respondent submitted that the appellant had not in substance been successful; that he had not obtained any result of any practical utility; and that he had known about the practical problems which would be involved in attempting to unwind the budget from evidence submitted by the respondent before the original hearing.
Delivering the reasons for the courts judgment on costs, ([2013] EWCA Civ 1483) Rimer LJ said that by the time that the appeal came on for hearing, it was far too late to consider granting any relief (by which he must have had in mind a quashing order), even if as to which the court had doubts it might have been appropriate for relief to be granted a year earlier when the matter was before Wyn Williams J. He continued: 5.
In these circumstances, the court considers that it would be wrong in principle to award any costs to Mr Hunt.
The appeal proved to be of no practical value to him; and, in the courts view it was always one which was destined to fail. 6.
As the council was the successful party in the appeal, the court considers that it is in principle entitled to its costs.
On the other hand, the court has regard to the fact that the council resisted the appeal not only on the basis that this was not a case for relief, but also on the two substantive grounds on which it lost.
Its resistance on those two grounds increased the costs of the appeal.
We regard that consideration as pointing away from an order awarding the council all of its costs.
The court concluded that the respondent should be entitled to recover half of its costs of the appeal.
The discretion of a court in a matter of costs is wide and it is highly unusual for this court to entertain an appeal on an issue of costs alone.
But the Court of Appeal said that it reached its decision as a matter of principle, treating the respondent as the successful party.
In adopting that approach, I consider that the court fell into error.
The rejection of the respondents case on the two issues on which the appellant was given leave to appeal was of greater significance than merely that the respondent had increased the costs of the appeal by its unsuccessful resistance.
The respondent was successful only in the limited sense that the findings of failure came too late to do anything about what had happened in the past, not because the appellant had been slow to raise them but because the respondent had resisted them successfully until the Court of Appeal gave its judgment.
The respondent was unsuccessful on the substantive issues regarding its statutory responsibilities.
There are also wider public factors to consider.
Public law is not about private rights but about public wrongs, as Sedley J said in R v Somerset County Council, Ex p Dixon [1998] Env LR 111 when considering a question of standing.
A court may refuse permission to bring a judicial review claim if it considers the claimant to be a mere meddler or if it considers that the proceedings are unlikely to be of sufficient significance to merit the time and costs involved.
But in this case the court considered that the issues were of sufficient significance to give permission.
And the ruling of the court, particularly under section 149, contained a lesson of general application for local authorities regarding the discharge by committee members of the councils equality duty.
If a party who has been given leave to bring a judicial review claim succeeds in establishing after fully contested proceedings that the defendant acted unlawfully, some good reason would have to be shown why he should not recover his reasonable costs.
I cannot see that the fact that in this case the determination of illegality came after it was too late to consider reopening the 2012/13 budget provided a principled reason for making the appellant pay any part of the respondents costs.
On the contrary, for the reasons stated the appellant was in principle entitled to some form of costs order in his favour.
The issues raised by the appellant at first instance were considerably wider than the issues on which he was given permission to appeal.
They included, for example, a far reaching challenge to the adequacy of the respondents EIAs.
This challenge required detailed rebuttal by the respondent.
The appellant also persisted in seeking an order to quash the decision approving the budget when that was unrealistic.
Those are reasons for limiting the order for costs in his favour.
Logically it might be said that a distinction should be drawn between the costs at first instance and in the Court of Appeal to reflect the different issues, but each hearing occupied the court for one day and the assessment can only be broad brush.
I would allow the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeals order and substitute an order that the appellant should recover two thirds of his costs both at first instance and in the Court of Appeal.
Having succeeded in reversing the costs orders made by the courts below, the appellant is entitled to his reasonable costs of so doing.
However, a significant proportion of his written and oral argument before this court was directed to the question of a declaration.
On that issue his argument had no merit when examined against the way that his case was presented in the lower courts, which only emerged fully from the submissions of the respondent.
As at present advised, I would order that the appellant should recover two thirds of his costs in this court, to be assessed if not agreed; but the order should not be drawn up for seven days, during which time either party may, if so advised, make written submissions as to why a different order should be made.
","Mr Aaron Hunt, born on 17 April 1991, suffers from ADHD, learning difficulties and behavioural problems.
As a result, North Somerset Council (the Council) are statutorily required, so far as reasonably practicable, to secure access for him to sufficient educational and recreational leisure time activities for the improvement of his well being.
On 21 February 2012, the Council made a decision to approve a reduction of 364,793 from its youth services budget for 2012/2013.
Mr Hunt, concerned about the impact this would have on the provision of services for young persons with disabilities, brought judicial review proceedings of that decision.
He argued that the decision was unlawful on two grounds: (1) the Council had failed its duty under section 507B of the Education Act 1996 to take properly into account the views of young persons with difficulties such as his; and, (2) it failed to fulfil its public sector equality duty under section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 to have due regard to the statutory equality needs of disabled individuals.
He sought a declaration that the Councils decision was unlawful and an order that the decision be quashed.
At the end of the High Court hearing, but before giving judgment, Wyn Williams J asked the parties barristers for written submissions on relief in the event that he found in favour of Mr Hunt.
The note provided by Mr Hunts barristers stated that he sought a quashing order but made no reference to a declaration.
Ultimately, Wyn Williams J rejected Mr Hunts challenges to the legality of the decision.
Mr Hunt was ordered to pay the Councils costs, subject to a proviso against enforcement of the costs order without further permission of the Court.
The Court of Appeal allowed Mr Hunts appeal on both grounds.
It, nonetheless, refused to make a quashing order, considering that it was too late to unwind the entire revenue budget for the financial year.
It also ordered him to pay half of the Councils costs.
Mr Hunts barristers did not make alternative submissions about declaratory relief so no mention was made of this in the Court of Appeals judgment.
Mr Hunts barristers did not raise this omission on receiving the judgment in draft and did not make suggestions as to the appropriate form of the order in light of the judgment.
The Councils barristers prepared a draft order stating that the appeal was dismissed.
Mr Hunts barristers stated in written submissions that the parties were agreed on the order except in relation to costs.
Mr Hunt appealed to the Supreme Court on the basis that the Court of Appeal should have made: (1) a declaration that the Council had failed in its statutory obligations; and, (2) an order for costs in his favour.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal in relation to costs but dismisses it in relation to declaratory relief.
Lord Toulson delivers the judgment of the Court.
Declaratory relief Lord Toulson rejects Mr Hunts argument that the Court of Appeal should have made a declaration of its own initiative.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal itself contained a ruling that the Council acted unlawfully and the authority of its judgment would be no greater or less by making or not making a declaration in the form of the order to the same effect.
A court is not required to make declaratory orders where, although a finding of illegality has been made, it is not asked to make a declaratory order by a partys experienced legal representatives [12].
Costs In relation to costs, although courts have wide discretion in this matter, the Court of Appeal fell into error by treating the Council as the successful party.
As the Court of Appeal rejected the Councils case on the two issues, it was only successful in the limited sense that the findings of failure came too late to do anything about what had happened in the past, although this occurred through no fault on Mr Hunts part.
It was unsuccessful on the substantive issues regarding its statutory responsibilities [15].
Indeed, the Court of Appeal judgment contained a lesson of general application for local authorities regarding the discharge by committee members of the Councils equality duty.
In such circumstances, where a local authority is shown to have acted unlawfully, some good reason would have to be shown why a claimant should not recover his reasonable costs [16].
Despite this, the reasons for limiting Mr Hunts order for costs in his favour in this case are that: he raised issues much wider than the issues on which he was given permission to appeal and which required detailed rebuttal; and, he persisted in seeking an unrealistic remedy a quashing order [17].
Consequently, the Court of Appeals order should be set aside and substituted with an order that Mr Hunt recover two thirds of his costs both in the High Court and in the Court of Appeal [18].
As to costs in this Court, although Mr Hunt is entitled to his reasonable costs, having succeeded in reversing the costs orders made by the courts below, a significant proportion of his argument was directed to the question of a declaration.
This had no merit.
Therefore, Mr Hunt should recover two thirds of his costs subject to either party making written submissions as to why a different order should be made [19].
"
uksc-2013-0158,"The question at issue on this appeal is what connection must a foreign company have with the United Kingdom to entitle an English court to wind it up, if its centre of main interests (or COMI) is in another member state of the European Union.
The answer depends on the meaning of two words, economic activity, in EU Regulation 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings.
The legal framework
Under section 221 of the Insolvency Act 1986, the English court has jurisdiction under its domestic law to wind up a foreign company.
However, in the case of companies whose COMI is in another member state of the EU, the exercise of this power is constrained by the Regulation.
Article 3 of the Regulation provides as follows: Article 3 International jurisdiction 1.
The courts of the Member State within the territory of which the centre of a debtor's main interests is situated shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings.
In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the centre of its main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. 2.
Where the centre of a debtor's main interests is situated within the territory of a Member State, the courts of another Member State shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if he possesses an establishment within the territory of that other Member State.
The effects of those proceedings shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the latter Member State.
Where insolvency proceedings have been opened under paragraph 1, any proceedings opened subsequently under paragraph 2 shall be secondary proceedings.
These latter proceedings must be winding up proceedings. 3.
The COMI is not a term of art, and is not defined in the body of the Regulation.
Recital (13), however, recites what is perhaps implicit in the phrase, namely that it should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.
Jurisdiction to begin secondary insolvency proceedings in another European jurisdiction is established on a very different basis.
It depends on the existence of an establishment within its territory.
An establishment is defined in article 2(h) as any place of operations where the debtor carries out a non transitory economic activity with human means and goods.
Goods is hardly a satisfactory English word to use in this context.
It is apparent from the equivalent term in the other language versions that it means the same as assets (biens, Vermgen) in article 3(2).
The facts
Olympic Airlines SA was wound up on the direction of the Athens Court of Appeal on 2 October 2009.
Since then, the main liquidation proceedings have been in progress in Greece.
The appellants are the trustees of the companys pension scheme.
Olympic is the principal employer in the scheme and the only employer currently participating in it.
Under the rules of the scheme, it must be wound up upon the liquidation of Olympic Airlines.
Upon its winding up, a deficit was ascertained of (in round numbers) 16m, which Olympic is bound to make good under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995.
On 20 July 2010, the trustees presented a winding up petition against the company in England on the ground that it was unable to meet this liability.
The size of Olympics deficiency means that they are unlikely to recover much.
But the winding up order was necessary in order that the scheme should qualify for entry into the Pension Protection Fund under section 127 of the Pensions Act 2004.
One of the conditions of entry was that a qualifying insolvency event should have occurred, and the only available one was that the company should have been ordered to be wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986: see Pensions Act 2004, section 121(3)(g).
Accordingly, the question arises whether Olympic had an establishment in the United Kingdom on 20 July 2010 so as to justify the presentation of a winding up petition on that date.
Olympic had had a number of offices in the United Kingdom, but the only ones which it still occupied on 20 July 2010 were its former UK head office at 11 Conduit Street in London, which it leased from an associated company.
The Chancellor heard evidence about the status of 11 Conduit Street and the activities that were carried on there at the relevant time.
He and the Court of Appeal made the following findings: (1) On 28 September 2009, shortly before the commencement of the liquidation proceedings in Greece, the area manager for Olympic in London was instructed that the company would cease all commercial operations as from 00.01 on the following day.
From that time all flight operations were undertaken by an unrelated company. (2) On 17 June 2010, the Greek liquidator informed the trustees of the pension fund that the employment of the 27 remaining UK staff would be terminated with effect from 14 July 2010.
Three persons, Mr Savva the General Manager, Mr Platanias the Finance and Purchasing Manager, and an accounts clerk, were retained thereafter on short term ad hoc contracts.
At the time of the English winding up petition, they were the only persons still working there. (3) Mr Savva attended the office at Conduit Street as required.
In practice this was about three or four times a week.
His function was to deal generally with anything requiring attention, principally instructions and requests from the liquidator and staff in Athens retained by him. (4) Mr Platanias arranged the payment of bills for his own salary and Mr Savvas, council tax, electricity and cleaning, and for minor repairs following a break in.
He reconciled bank statements, copied and sent relevant documents to the liquidator and his staff in Athens and dealt generally with post and telephone calls.
He supervised the disposal of the companys assets in England, a process which had begun before the winding up petition and continued for some time afterwards.
These comprised a current and deposit account, computers and office furniture, fixtures and fittings and computerised accounting records.
They had no substantial realisable value.
The Chancellor found that Mr Platanias functions were exactly what is to be expected from one responsible to an overseas liquidator for winding up the affairs of a foreign branch of a formerly substantial overseas trading company. (5) The clerk assisted in these activities under the direction of Mr Savva or Mr Platanias.
The decisions of the courts below
The Chancellor considered that to be economic an activity did not have to amount to external market activity: [2013] 1 BCLC 415.
He found that these activities constituted non transitory economic activities for the purpose of the definition of establishment and made the winding up order.
The Court of Appeal (Moore Bick LJ, Sir Stephen Sedley and Sir Bernard Rix) overruled him: [2014] 1 WLR 1401.
In summary, they thought that the relevant economic activity had to consist of more than the activity involved in winding up the companys affairs, and that the three remaining employees were doing no more than that.
After the Court of Appeal handed down its decision, the law was changed.
A statutory power under the Pensions Act 2004 was exercised so as to prescribe an additional insolvency event for the purpose of section 121.
The additional event was defined in such a way as to apply only to cases in which insolvency proceedings had been commenced in another member state of the EU in respect of an employer whose COMI was located in that state, and secondary proceedings had been begun in the United Kingdom but had subsequently been set aside for want of jurisdiction: see the Pension Fund (Entry Rules) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/1664).
This appears to be a class of one: the present case.
However, for technical reasons, the present issue remains important even though the effect of the amendment is to enable the Olympic pension scheme to qualify for the Pension Protection Fund on the basis of the Greek proceedings.
The reason is that where the new insolvency event applies it is deemed to occur on the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the Greek proceedings, ie on 2 October 2014.
This is rather more than four years after the date of the winding up order made by the High Court.
This matters, because of the possibility that the Board of the Pension Protection Fund might require the trustees of the Olympic scheme to claw back any overpaid benefits between the commencement of the Greek liquidation proceedings and the relevant insolvency event.
If that event occurred on 2 October 2014 instead of 29 May 2012, the period over which the benefits may be clawed back will be longer.
Authorities
The text of the Regulation is largely derived from the Convention on Insolvency Proceedings which was opened for signature in Brussels on 23 November 1995, but failed for want of a sufficient number of signatories.
The Convention had been the subject of an authoritative commentary by Professor Miguel Virgos and M Etienne Schmit.
According to the Virgos Schmit Report (3 May 1996, OJL 6500/96), the definition of establishment reflected a compromise between universalist states, who favoured a single liquidation with universal effect, and territorialist states, who wished to recognise a jurisdiction to open national territorial proceedings based on the mere presence of local business assets whether or not there was any local place of business.
The compromise consisted in the acceptance by the territorialists that jurisdiction to open secondary proceedings should be founded on the existence of a local establishment, but with a broad definition of the activities that must be carried on there.
At para 71, the Report commented on the resultant definition as follows: 71.
For the Convention on insolvency proceedings, establishment is understood to mean a place of operations through which the debtor carries out an economic activity on a non transitory basis, and where he uses human resources and goods.
Place of operations means a place from which economic activities are exercised on the market (ie externally), whether the said activities are commercial, industrial or professional.
The emphasis on an economic activity having to be carried out using human resources shows the need for a minimum level of organization.
A purely occasional place of operations cannot be classified as an establishment.
A certain stability is required.
The negative formula (non transitory) aims to avoid minimum time requirements.
The decisive factor is how the activity appears externally, and not the intention of the debtor.
The rationale behind the rule is that foreign economic operators conducting their economic activities through a local establishment should be subject to the same rules as national economic operators as long as they are both operating in the same market.
In this way, potential creditors concluding a contract with a local establishment will not have to worry about whether the company is a national or foreign one.
Their information costs and legal risks in the event of insolvency of the debtor will be the same whether they conclude a contract with a national undertaking or a foreign undertaking with a local presence on that market.
Naturally, the possibility of opening local territorial insolvency proceedings makes sense only if the debtor possesses sufficient assets within the jurisdiction.
Whether or not these assets are linked to the economic activities of the establishment is of no relevance.
This provides much the most useful source of guidance.
By comparison, there is very limited help to be had from decided cases.
Decisions on the location of a companys COMI are addressed to a different test.
Decisions on what constitutes an establishment can rarely be more than illustrative given the fact sensitive nature of the inquiry.
In (Case C 396/09) Interedil Srl (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil Srl [2011] ECR I 9939: [2012] BUS LR 1582, the Court of Justice of the European Union dealt with the question whether the presence of immovable property was enough to confer jurisdiction to open secondary insolvency proceedings.
The court did not specifically address the question what constituted economic activity, but it dealt generally with the definition of establishment at paras 61 63 as follows:
61. Article 2(h) of the Regulation defines the term establishment as designating any place of operations where the debtor carries out a non transitory economic activity with human means and goods. 62.
The fact that that definition links the pursuit of an economic activity to the presence of human resources shows that a minimum level of organisation and a degree of stability are required.
It follows that, conversely, the presence alone of goods in isolation or bank accounts does not, in principle, satisfy the requirements for classification as an establishment. 63.
Since, in accordance with article 3(2) of the Regulation, the presence of an establishment in the territory of a member state confers jurisdiction on the courts of that State to open secondary insolvency proceedings against the debtor, it must be concluded that, in order to ensure legal certainty and foreseeability concerning the determination of the courts with jurisdiction, the existence of an establishment must be determined, in the same way as the location of the centre of main interests, on the basis of objective factors which are ascertainable by third parties.
Two English decisions illustrate the application of the test to particular facts.
In Shierson v Vlieland Boddy [2005] 1 WLR 3966, the Court of Appeal was concerned with an English debtor whose COMI was in Spain but who let and managed premises in England.
It cited and implicitly adopted para 71 of the Virgos Schmit Report, and concluded that the letting and management of the premises themselves was enough to make them an establishment.
In In re Office Metro Ltd [2012] BCC 829, Mann J was concerned with secondary proceedings in England in respect of an English company whose COMI was in Luxembourg and which was in liquidation there.
It used an office in England, at which it handled the settlement of liabilities on guarantees of leases to associated companies, dealt with Companies Act filings, forwarded post, and occasionally took legal and accountancy advice.
Perhaps wisely, the judge did not attempt a general definition of economic activity, but expressed the view that the activities carried out at the relevant premises were not economic activities and that in any event they were transitory.
Application to the present case
The definition in article 2(h) must be read as a whole, not broken down into discrete elements, for each element colours the others.
The relevant activities must be (i) economic, (ii) non transitory, (iii) carried on from a place of operations, and (iv) using the debtors assets and human agents.
This suggests that what is envisaged is a fixed place of business.
The requirement that the activities should be carried on with the debtors assets and human agents suggests a business activity consisting in dealings with third parties, and not pure acts of internal administration.
As the Virgos Schmit Report suggests, the activities must be exercised on the market (ie externally).
I am inclined to think that the same point was being made by the Court of Justice when it observed in Interedil that the activities must be sufficiently accessible to enable third parties, that is to say in particular the companys creditors, to be aware of them.
I do not think that this can sensibly be read as requiring that the debtor should simply be locatable or identifiable by a brass plate on a door.
It refers to the character of the economic activities.
They must be activities which by their nature involve business dealings with third parties.
Manifestly, some activities which a company in liquidation might carry on, may satisfy the definition.
This may happen not only where the liquidator carries on the business with a view to its disposal but also, for example, where he disposes of stock in trade on the market.
On the other hand, where a company has no subsisting business it is clearly not the case that the mere internal administration of its winding up will qualify.
Such activity would not be exercised on the market; moreover, if it were enough to establish
jurisdiction then the requirement for economic activities would add little
or nothing to the rest of the definition.
Indeed, the definition would almost always be satisfied by a debtor who retained premises in the United Kingdom with inevitable outgoings such as the payment of rent, business rates, and so on.
It is unnecessary in the present case to undertake the difficult task of drawing a precise boundary between these extremes because, on any reasonable view of the meaning and purpose of the definition, the facts of this case are on the wrong side of it.
Olympic was not carrying on any business activity at 11 Conduit Street on the relevant date.
The last of the companys business activities had ceased some time before.
All that Mr Savva and Mr Platanias were doing was handling matters of internal administration associated with the final stages of the companys disposal of the means of carrying on business.
The company cannot therefore be said to have had an establishment in the United Kingdom.
Reference under Article 267 TFEU
In my opinion, the necessity for showing at least some subsisting business with third parties before the definition can be satisfied is acte clair, even if the exact nature of that business and the degree to which it must be visible to outsiders may be open to argument.
Since in this case no external business at all was carried on from 11 Conduit Street, there is no point of principle calling for a reference.
Disposal
I would dismiss the appeal.
","Olympic Airlines SA was wound up by a court in Athens on 2 October 2009.
The main liquidation proceedings are ongoing in Greece.
The company pension scheme has a 16m deficit.
Olympic Airlines SA is liable to make good the deficit by s 75 of the Pensions Act 1995.
It is unlikely to be able to do so.
Members of the pension scheme are eligible for compensation under the Pensions Act 2004 from the UKs Pension Protection Fund in respect of the shortfall.
Such compensation is payable from the date when a qualifying insolvency event occurred.
There are two possible dates in this case.
The first possible date is 20 July 2010, which is when the trustees of the pension scheme presented a winding up petition in England.
The winding up of a company under the Insolvency Act 1986 is a qualifying insolvency event: Pensions Act 2004, s 121(3)(g).
English courts have jurisdiction to wind up a foreign company under the Insolvency Act 1986.
However, under EU Regulation 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings (the Regulation), where (as here) the company has its centre of main interests in another member state of the European Union, the English court is only permitted to wind it up if it has an establishment in England, meaning any place of operations where the debtor carries out a non transitory economic activity with human means and goods (article 2(h)).
The second possible date is 2 October 2014, which is the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the proceedings in Greece.
The possibility of treating this date as the date of a qualifying insolvency event in the specific circumstances of this case was created by a change in legislation subsequent to the Court of Appeals decision in this case refusing to make a winding up order on the basis of lack of jurisdiction: Pension Fund (Entry Rules) (Amendment) Regulations 2014.
The trustees of the pension scheme would prefer compensation to be treated as payable from the earlier of those two dates, namely 20 July 2010.
The only question for the court is therefore whether Olympic Airlines SA had an establishment in the UK on 20 July 2010 entitling the English court to make a winding up order under the Regulation, so that it can be said that a qualifying insolvency event occurred on that date.
By 20 July 2010, Olympic Airlines SA had: closed all of its offices in the UK except for its head office at 11 Conduit Street in London; ceased all commercial operations; and terminated the contracts of all remaining UK staff except for the General Manager, the Purchasing Manager, and an accounts clerk, who were retained on short term ad hoc contracts to implement instructions from the liquidator in Athens, supervise the disposal of the companys assets in the UK, and pay bills and conduct other administration relating to the head office building.
At first instance, the judge held that these activities constituted non transitory economic activities and Olympic Airlines SA therefore had an establishment in the UK entitling him to make the winding up order.
The Court of Appeal disagreed and held that the remaining activity consisted only in the winding up of the companys affairs, which was not enough to give the court jurisdiction to make the order.
The trustees of the pension scheme appeal from the Court of Appeals decision.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Sumption gives the only judgment.
Lord Sumption holds that the Regulations definition of establishment, which must be read as a whole, envisages a fixed place of business and business activity carried on there consisting in dealings with third parties, and not merely acts of internal administration [13].
For example, disposal of stock in trade would clearly satisfy the definition, but mere internal administration of the winding up including administration of remaining premises in the UK would not [14].
Olympic Airlines SA was not carrying on business activity at its head office on 20 July 2010 and did not therefore have an establishment in the UK at that date [16].
The requirement of showing at least some subsisting business with third parties is acte clair and so no reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union is necessary [16].
"
uksc-2012-0162,"This appeal is the lead case in a number of appeals concerned with the interpretation of the phrase in section 6(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, [w]here in any tax week earnings are paid to or for the benefit of an earner.
It focuses on the meaning of the word earnings in that phrase.
The context is the payment of an employers contribution to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme.
Until 2006 such schemes were commonly used to top up sums available through tax approved pension schemes.
The facts
On 11 April 2002 the appellant company (FML) established by trust deed a retirement benefit scheme to provide relevant benefits (as defined in section 612 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) to its employees and directors.
The trust provided that, upon a members retirement from service, the trustees were to apply the accumulated fund in providing the member with a pension for life or such other relevant benefits as they might agree with him.
On the members death the trustees were to realise the accumulated fund and apply the net proceeds to or for the benefit of a defined discretionary class of beneficiary.
On the same day Mr McHugh, a shareholder and director of FML, asked to become a member of the scheme.
He informed the trustees that he wished them to exercise their discretion in favour of his wife in the event of his death.
FML made an initial cash contribution to the scheme of 1,000 and transferred to it Treasury Stock with the nominal value of 162,000, both for Mr McHughs benefit.
He has been the only member of the scheme.
He has received no relevant benefits from the scheme.
When the transfers were made to the scheme Mr McHugh was 54 years old.
He had no vested interest in the assets of the scheme because the retirement age under the scheme was defined as meaning: the date between the 50th birthday and the 85th birthday notified to a Member by the Employer as the date on which the Members benefits will become payable.
Such date may be varied from time to time by agreement in writing between the Employer and the Member.
FML specified Mr McHughs retirement age to be his 60th birthday.
But, as HMRC pointed out, he controlled FML and was in a position to bring forward his retirement date for the purposes of the trust deed.
The Issue
The principal issue which we address is whether the transfer of the cash and Treasury Stock to the scheme was a payment of earnings to or for the benefit of Mr McHugh within the meaning of section 6 of the 1992 Act.
It was agreed that the payment was for his benefit.
But was it earnings for the purposes of that section?
The prior proceedings
FML appealed against HMRCs decision that it was liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance Contributions on the value of the transfer.
The Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber) (Floyd J and Judge Avery Jones) heard the appeal at first instance.
It delivered a judgment on 21 February 2011 allowing the appeal.
HMRC appealed to the Court of Appeal (Arden LJ, Rimer LJ and Ryder J).
By a judgment dated 30 May 2012 the Court of Appeal by a majority (Arden LJ and Ryder J) allowed the appeal and restored the decision of HMRC.
Before this court Mr Bramwell presented FMLs appeal on a much narrower front than the case which had been debated before the Court of Appeal.
Until his oral submissions to us, FMLs case had been that earnings in NIC legislation covered the same ground as emoluments in income tax legislation.
FML abandoned that position and focused principally on the contingent nature of Mr McHughs interest in the transferred assets.
In short, Mr Bramwell accepted that earnings had a wider meaning than emoluments in income tax legislation.
His submission was that the payment of earnings under section 6 of the 1992 Act did not extend to the employers transfer to a trust of funds or assets in which the earner had at the time of the transfer only a contingent interest.
We, and Mr Jones for HMRC, therefore had to address a different argument from that advanced before the Court of Appeal.
Counsel for both parties argued their cases very ably.
Discussion
The legislative history that lies behind our present system of national insurance shows that Mr Bramwells change of position was correct: National Insurance Contributions (NICs) have been levied on a basis which is different from the emoluments on which income tax has been raised.
Mr David Lloyd George, when Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1911, introduced the first compulsory system of insurance against illness and unemployment in the United Kingdom: the National Insurance Act 1911.
The Act fixed contributions rates by reference to the level of an employed persons remuneration (section 4 and Second Schedule).
Lord Beveridge carried out a substantial review of the by then expanded system of national insurance and reported in 1942.
The Beveridge Report (Cmnd 6404) was implemented by the National Insurance Act 1946, which established the National Insurance Fund, into which workers, employers and the state were to contribute.
Employers and employed persons were required to make weekly contributions into the National Insurance Fund to pay benefits to the earners and their dependants.
Contributions were paid in respect of earnings.
In section 78 of the 1946 Act earnings were interpreted to include any remuneration or profit derived from a gainful occupation.
The current provision for NICs is contained in the 1992 Act and subordinate legislation.
Sections 6 to 9 of that Act provide, in relation to an earner employed under a contract of service, that where in any tax week earnings are paid to or for his benefit, the employed earner shall pay a primary Class 1 contribution and his employer will pay a secondary Class 1 contribution (both subject to specified thresholds).
Section 3 of the 1992 Act provides that earnings includes any remuneration or profit derived from an employment.
In my view it is significant that Parliament in the1946 Act, chose to use the word earnings rather than emoluments, which had been a term used in income tax legislation with a definition which had remained substantially unchanged since the Income Tax Act 1842.
The latter word had been the subject of judicial interpretation.
In particular, in Tennant v Smith [1892] AC 150, the case of the Montrose bank manager whose employer gave him free accommodation in a bank house which he was required to occupy, the House of Lords held that the Inland Revenue could not charge income tax on the value of the accommodation because the employee could not convert the benefit into money.
The House of Lords held that emoluments were confined to actual money payments and to benefits in kind which were capable of being turned into money by the recipient.
See also Lord Reids explanation of the case in Heaton v Bell [1970] AC 728, 744 745.
By contrast, from the outset, the word earnings in NICs legislation has included benefits in kind which the recipient could not convert into money there and then.
Part I of the First Schedule to the 1946 Act, which set out the contribution rates of employed persons, had a rate for earners earning remuneration of under 30 shillings per week and a higher rate for those earning remuneration above that sum.
Like the 1911 Act (section 4 and Second Schedule) it treated remuneration, which, as I have said, formed part of the definition of earnings in section 78, as including the provision of board and lodging by providing: For the purpose of this and Part II of this Schedule [which set out employers rates] a person shall be deemed to be earning remuneration at a weekly rate of thirty shillings or less if, but only if, his remuneration does not include the provision of board and lodging by the employer and the rate of the remuneration does not exceed thirty shillings a week, and to be earning remuneration at a weekly rate exceeding thirty shillings in any other case.
Since then, primary and subordinate legislation pertaining to NICs has made express provision for benefits in kind to be disregarded when Parliament has not wanted such earnings to be taken into account in the calculation of NICs.
In the National Insurance Act 1959, which introduced a graduated pension scheme on top of flat rate benefits, benefits in kind which the recipient could not convert into moneys worth were excluded from the calculation of graduated contributions by the device (in section 2(1)) of deeming remuneration to include only emoluments assessable to income tax under Schedule E.
That arrangement was preserved in the National Insurance Act 1965 (section 4(2)).
But in 1975 the basic scheme and graduated scheme were replaced by a new scheme which provided for graduated contributions related to the level of earnings between a lower earnings limit and an upper earnings limit.
The link between graduated contributions and emoluments for income tax purposes was abolished.
Since then, subordinate legislation has provided for the disregard of, among others, any payment in kind or by way of provision of board or lodging (the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations: SI 1973/1264, regulation 17(1)(d); SI 1975/492, regulation 17(1)(d); SI 1979/591, regulation 19(1)(d); and now SI 2001/1004, para 1 of Part II of Schedule 3 see para 13 below).
In 1985 the upper earnings limit was removed in relation to employer contributions, and since 6 April 2003 employees have been subject to an additional surcharge on earnings above the upper earnings limit (currently 2%).
Under the 1992 Act and current subordinate legislation, the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/1004) as amended, a similar arrangement of using earnings as the basis of calculating liability to NICs and disregarding payments in kind has been maintained.
Thus in Schedule 3 to the 2001 Regulations (Part II para 1) it is provided: A payment in kind, or by way of the provision of services, board and lodging or other facilities is to be disregarded in the calculation of earnings.
It is not appropriate to interpret an Act of Parliament by reference to subordinate legislation which was made years after the primary legislation (Deposit Protection Board v Barclays Bank plc [1994] 2 AC 367, 397 per Lord Browne Wilkinson; see also Hanlon v The Law Society [1981] AC 124, 193 194 per Lord Lowry).
But that is not my purpose.
I refer to the 2001 Regulations simply to demonstrate that the scheme of NICs legislation by which earnings includes non convertible benefits in kind unless they are disregarded, either expressly or by necessary implication, has existed at least since 1946.
As FML accepts the proposition that earnings in NICs legislation is not to be equated with emoluments in income tax legislation, most of the arguments which engaged the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal fall away.
Instead, the debate has focused on whether FML had paid earnings to or for the benefit of Mr McHugh when it made the transfer to the trust at a time when Mr McHughs interest in the assets of the trust was only a contingent one which might have been defeated by his death before his specified retirement age.
As I have said, both parties agreed that the transfer to the trust had been for the benefit of Mr McHugh.
The question was: was the transfer the payment of earnings?
On this narrow issue, HMRCs stance before this court was remarkable.
Because of the assumptions on which the subordinate legislation had been framed, Mr Jones had to submit that earnings are paid to an earner both when assets are transferred to a pension scheme to be held on a trust and also when payments are made from the trust fund.
HMRC looked to the payment and not to what the earner received.
HMRC argued that the payment into the trust fund was earnings because it was a sum paid as the quid pro quo for past or future services.
It was part of Mr McHughs remuneration.
The sum went to a trust fund which was solely for the benefit of Mr McHugh and his wife.
Mr McHugh, it was submitted, was immediately better off because he had the hope of receiving the trust fund in the future, and his family would benefit if he did not survive until his retirement age.
Payments to him out of the trust fund would as a matter of principle also be earnings when made because they also were payments to him in respect of his employment.
On this approach, double counting was avoided only by Part VI of Schedule 3 to the 2001 Regulations which disregards, among others, payments by way of pension (para 1) and payments by way of relevant benefits pursuant to an unapproved retirement benefits scheme (para 4).
There are three reasons why I think that HMRCs argument is wrong.
The first and principal reason is that the ordinary man on the underground would consider it to be counter intuitive that a person would earn remuneration both when his employer paid money into a trust to create a fund for his benefit and again when at a later date that trust fund was paid out to him.
The argument would in principle apply also when a company gave an employee a bonus, which was put into a trust or in an escrow fund and was payable at a future date only if the company performed to a specified level by then: he would earn the bonus twice.
I am reluctant to attribute such a view to Parliament absent clear words or necessary implication, of which there are neither.
If one gives words their ordinary meaning, it is clear that a retired earner receives earnings in respect of his employment in the form of deferred remuneration when he receives his pension.
So too does an earner when he receives his deferred bonus.
In each case I would characterise the payment from the trust or escrow fund as deferred earnings.
It follows that the payment into the trust or escrow fund would not be earnings.
Secondly, it is only by looking exclusively to what was paid and ignoring what the earner received that HMRCs view can be sustained.
But such an interpretation of section 6(1) of the 1992 Act denudes the word earnings of any meaning, so that the phrase earnings are paid would amount to payments are made in respect of any one employment.
Earnings in this context are remuneration derived from the employment.
The use of the word earnings points the reader towards what the employee obtains from his employment.
Looking to what the earner receives avoids the counter intuitive result.
The third and subordinate reason relates to the method of computation.
HMRC, by treating the payment into the trust as earnings, fail to take into account the existence of the contingency.
If Mr McHugh had died before his retirement date, the trustees would have realised the accumulated fund and paid the proceeds to a member of the defined discretionary class of beneficiary probably his wife.
One must ask: what did Mr McHugh receive through the transfer? It was not the cash and Treasury Stock.
The trustees received the assets transferred to them on the trusts of the fund and not unconditionally for Mr McHugh.
The transfer gave him only the entitlement to a future pension or relevant benefits once a condition his reaching retirement age had been purified.
It does not matter that Mr McHugh could not immediately convert his entitlement into money because, as I have said, non convertible benefits in kind are in principle earnings in the NICs legislation.
But the hypothetical value to be attributed to Mr McHughs entitlement would not be the value, at the date of the transfer, of the assets paid into the fund.
Rather it would be the value of his contingent right to the trust fund such as it would be at his retirement date.
That calculation would not be a simple exercise.
The valuer would have to allow for both the contingency of the earners pre deceasing the specified retirement date and the uncertainty of the trustees performance in managing the fund until that date.
That would not be the same as the value of the cash and assets in the week in which the transfer was made.
HMRCs approach, by treating the payment into the trust fund as Mr McHughs earnings, fails to address what it was that he received when the transfer was made.
In my view therefore the transfer to the trust was not the payment of earnings to or for the benefit of Mr McHugh within the meaning of section 6(1) of the 1992 Act.
Having reached this view on the issue which the parties presented in this appeal, I comment briefly on some of the cases to which counsel referred.
This case was presented as a test case on the issue of principle.
No argument was advanced as to whether a payment into a pension or bonus fund might properly be analysed as a payment out of the earners salary as in Smyth v Stretton (1904) 5 TC 36.
Mr Jones stated that HMRC might take that point in an appropriate case.
Edwards v Roberts (1935) 19 TC 618 assists in this case not because it is correct to equate earnings in NICs legislation with emoluments in income tax legislation but because of its application of the general law in relation to a contingent interest and its focus on what an employee receives.
In that case an employee received a salary and also, if he remained in employment for more than five years, a right to receive at the end of a subsequent financial year part of the capital of a trust fund into which his employer paid a proportion of its annual profits.
Lord Hanworth MR stated (p 638): [U]nder these circumstances there could not be said to have accrued to this employee a vested interest in these successive sums placed to his credit, but only that he had a chance of being paid a sum at the end of six years if all went well.
I would therefore allow the appeal and reinstate the judgment of the Upper
HMRC submitted and the majority of the Court of Appeal accepted that Collins J had been in error in Tullett & Tokyo Forex International Ltd v Secretary of State for Social Security [2000] EWHC (Admin) 350; [2000] All ER (D) 739 because he held that NICs were payable on what the employee receives.
For the reasons set out above, I disagree with HMRCs submission.
Conclusion
Tribunal.
","This appeal is the lead case in a number of appeals concerned with liability to pay National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and, in particular, with the interpretation of the phrase in section 6(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, [w]here in any tax week earnings are paid to or for the benefit of an earner.
The case focuses on the meaning of the word earnings in that phrase, and whether it covers a payment by the appellant, FML, of an employers contribution to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme [1].
The scheme was set up by FML by trust deed on 11 April 2002 to provide certain benefits to its employees and directors.
The trust provided that upon a members retirement from service the trustees were to apply the accumulated fund in providing the member with a pension for life or such other relevant benefits as might be agreed.
On the members death the trustees were to realise the accumulated fund and apply the net proceeds to or for the benefit of a defined discretionary class of beneficiary.
On the same day, Mr McHugh, a shareholder and director of FML, asked to become a member of the scheme.
He informed the trustees that he wished them to exercise their discretion in favour of his wife in the event of his death.
FML made an initial cash contribution to the scheme of 1,000 and transferred to it Treasury Stock with the nominal value of 162,000, both for Mr McHughs benefit.
He has been the only member of the scheme and has received no relevant benefits from it, as defined in section 612 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 [2].
He was 54 years old when the transfers were made, and FML specified his retirement age to be his 60th birthday.
However as he controlled FML this date could be brought forward for the purposes of the scheme [3].
The question was whether the transfers were payments of earnings to or for the benefit of Mr McHugh within the meaning of section 6 of the 1992 Act.
It was agreed that the payment was for his benefit, but was it earnings? HMRC decided that it was, and that FML was therefore liable to pay Class 1 NICs on the value of the transfer.
FMLs appeal to the Upper Tribunal was successful, but the Court of Appeal reinstated HMRCs decision [4 5].
FML appealed to the Supreme Court.
Departing from its position before the Court of Appeal, FML accepted that earnings had a wider meaning than emoluments in income tax legislation.
It submitted that the payment of earnings under section 6 did not extend to the employers transfer to a trust of funds or assets in which the earner had at the time of the transfer only a contingent interest [6].
In a judgment delivered by Lord Hodge, the Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
Lord Hodge examines the legislative history behind the UKs system of national insurance, which shows that NICs have indeed been levied on a basis that is different from the emoluments on which income tax has been raised [7 13].
He considers it significant that Parliament, in the National Insurance Act 1946, chose to use the word earnings rather than emoluments.
The latter word has been interpreted by the courts as referring to actual money payments and benefits in kind capable of being turned into money by the recipient [10].
Lord Hodge refers to primary legislation in 1911 and 1946 and also subordinate legislation for the purpose of demonstrating that the scheme of NICs legislation by which earnings includes non convertible benefits in kind (unless they are disregarded) has existed since 1946 [11 13].
As a result of the assumptions on which the subordinate legislation had been framed, HMRC had to argue that earnings are paid to an earner both when assets are transferred to a pension scheme to be held on a trust and also when payments are made from the trust fund.
HMRC looked to the payment and not to what the earner received.
The sum paid into the trust was part of Mr McHughs remuneration, going into a trust fund for the sole benefit of Mr McHugh and his wife.
Payments out to him from the trust would also, it was submitted, be earnings as they were also payments to him in respect of his employment.
Double counting would be avoided only as a result of specific disregards in the subordinate legislation [15].
Lord Hodge considers that remarkable position to be wrong for three reasons: First, the ordinary man on the underground would consider it counter intuitive that a person would earn remuneration both when his employer paid money into a trust to create a fund for his benefit and again when at a later date the trust fund was paid out to him.
If one gives words their ordinary meaning, it is clear that a retired earner receives earnings in respect of his employment in the form of deferred remuneration when he receives his pension.
The payment from the trust is deferred earnings; the payment into it is not earnings [16].
Secondly, HMRCs view could only be sustained by looking exclusively at what was paid and ignoring what the earner received.
Such an interpretation denudes the word earnings of any meaning, so the phrase earnings are paid would amount to payments are made [17].
The third reason relates to the method of computation.
By treating the payment into the trust as earnings, HMRC fail to take into account the existence of the contingency.
The transfer gave Mr McHugh not cash and treasury stock, but only the entitlement to a future pension or relevant benefits once the condition of reaching retirement age had been purified.
The hypothetical value to his entitlement would not be the value at the date of the transfer of the assets paid into the fund, but the value of Mr McHughs contingent right to the trust fund such as it would be at his retirement age.
That would not be a simple exercise, and HMRCs approach fails to address what it was that Mr McHugh received when the transfer was made [18].
Lord Hodge concludes that the transfer to the trust was not the payment of earnings for section 6(1) purposes [19].
The court allows FMLs appeal and reinstates the judgment of the Upper Tribunal [22].
"
uksc-2017-0006,"This is an interlocutory appeal in a criminal case which concerns the correct construction of section 92(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (the 1994 Act).
The appellants are a limited company and two individuals connected with its management.
They are indicted for, inter alia, offences of unauthorised use of trade marks, contrary to section 92(1)(b) and (c) of the 1994 Act.
No trial has yet been held, and the Crown case remains at this point a matter merely of allegation, which may or may not be proved.
At a preparatory hearing in the Crown Court, they advanced a submission that part of what was alleged was, on any view, outside the terms of section 92 and no offence.
Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) rejected that submission.
They renew it in this court.
What is alleged is that the defendants are engaged in the bulk importation and subsequent sale of goods such as clothes and shoes.
The goods, or many of them, are said to bear what appear to be the trade marks of well known brands, such as Ralph Lauren, Adidas, Under Armour, Jack Wills, Fred Perry or similar.
The goods were manufactured abroad, in countries outside the EU.
Some of the goods in the possession of the defendants are said to have been manufactured by people who were neither the trade mark proprietor, nor authorised by the proprietor to make them.
This first category of goods, the appellants describe as counterfeits in the true sense.
A significant portion of the remainder of the goods are, however, ones where there had originally been an authorisation of manufacture by the registered trade mark holder, whether by subcontract, licence or otherwise, but whose sale had not been authorised by him.
They were thus sold, bearing the trade mark, without the consent of the owner of the mark.
The causes of the non authorisation of sale might be, it is said, various.
Some garments might deliberately have been made by the factories in excess of the numbers permitted by the trade mark owner, so that the balance could be sold for their own benefit.
Some might have been made in excess of the order without that original ulterior intention (indeed perhaps as precautionary spare capacity planned and approved by the trade mark owner), but then have been put on the market without his consent.
Some might have been made under a permission which was cancelled by the trade mark owner; that in turn might include cases where the trade mark owner was dissatisfied with the quality and not prepared to have the goods put on the market as if their own, but cancellation might not be limited to that cause.
Those are not exhaustive of the possibilities.
These latter various types of goods are described by the appellants as goods appearing on the grey market.
It is common ground that neither the indictment nor the way the Crown puts its case distinguishes between these various different provenances.
That led to submissions that the indictment would turn out either to be bad for duplicity or to be misleading, and at risk of producing verdicts which it was difficult to interpret.
Thus was the point now at issue identified.
In short, it is common ground that: (i) before there can be a criminal offence of unauthorised use of a trade mark there must be an infringement of that mark which would be unlawful as a matter of civil law; see R v Johnstone [2003] UKHL 28; [2003] 1 WLR 1736; and (ii) the sale, or the possession in the course of trade, of goods of any of the various provenances set out in para 5 above, would amount to an infringement of trade marks, giving rise to civil liability.
But the appellants case is that whilst any of the various provenances set out would involve civil liability, it is only in the case of what they describe as true counterfeits that there is any criminal offence.
They say that goods which were originally manufactured with the permission of the trade mark proprietor, but which are ones where he has not authorised the sale, are not true counterfeits and are not within the statute.
Section 92(1) does not apply, they contend, to goods put on the grey market.
The resolution of this contention depends on the true construction of section 92(1) of the 1994 Act.
It says: 92. (1) A person commits an offence who with a view to gain for himself or another, or with intent to cause loss to another, and without the consent of the proprietor (a) applies to goods or their packaging a sign identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark, or (b) sells or lets for hire, offers or exposes for sale or hire or distributes goods which bear, or the packaging of which bears, such a sign, or (c) has in his possession, custody or control in the course of a business any such goods with a view to the doing of anything, by himself or another, which would be an offence under paragraph (b).
Subsection 92(5) adds a reverse onus statutory defence: (5) It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to show that he believed on reasonable grounds that the use of the sign in the manner in which it was used, or was to be used, was not an infringement of the registered trade mark.
The appellants contention focuses on the use of the expression such a sign in subsection (1)(b).
That refers back, they say, to subsection (1)(a).
And by referring back to (1)(a), they say, it means that (b) applies only to goods where the relevant sign (ie trade mark) has been applied without the consent of the proprietor.
Any goods in the grey market category have had the trade mark originally applied with the consent of the proprietor.
It is only the sale which the proprietor has not authorised.
Therefore, they say, those goods are not ones to which paragraph (a) of the subsection could apply.
It follows, they contend, that they are not, when it comes to paragraph (b), goods which bear such a sign.
It may readily be agreed that the expression such a sign in section 92(1)(b) refers back to the sign described in the immediately preceding paragraph (a).
The difficulty comes when one is asked to read such a sign as incorporating the words without the consent of the proprietor which appear in the first few lines of the section before (a), and also the requirement that the sign has been applied to the goods (without such consent), which is the central component of the offence under (a).
This is simply not a possible construction of section 92(1).
There is no difficulty, on the ordinary reading of paragraphs (a) and (b), in seeing what the reference back to such a sign in (b) imports from (a).
Such a sign in (b) plainly means a sign such as is described in (a).
The sign described in (a) is a sign which is identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark.
Signs (or trade marks) having any of the provenances described in para 5 above are squarely within this description.
So called grey market goods are caught by the expression.
The offences set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 92 are, as a matter of plain reading, not cumulative, but separate.
It is not necessary that one has been committed (by someone) before one can say that the next in line has been.
The mental element of a view to gain or the intent to cause loss is applicable to all three.
So is the element that the use made of the sign is without the consent of its proprietor.
Paragraph (a) then makes it an offence to apply such a mark, without consent and with the relevant mental element.
Paragraph (b) makes it an offence to sell (etc) goods with such a mark, without the consent of the proprietor and with the necessary mental element.
Paragraph (c) does the same for the preparatory offence of possession in the course of business with a view to behaviour which would be an offence under (b), again without the consent of the proprietor and with the relevant mental element.
Subparagraph (c) thus involves anticipation (but not necessarily the commission) of an offence under (b).
Of course, a person may commit all three offences, or different people may commit all three between them.
But that is not necessary.
Each stands alone.
The appellants reading of paragraph (b) is, by contrast, strained and unnatural.
It does not simply reach back to (a) but to the general words of the section which precede it.
It requires one to read sign in (a), which is incorporated into (b), as which bears a sign, so applied, or at least as such a sign, so applied.
This being so, there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language such as would justify the court, pursuant to Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593, in investigating the contents of Parliamentary debate at the time of the passage of the Bill which became the 1994 Act.
Nor can it be suggested that the ordinary (or literal) reading of the Act gives rise to absurdity.
It should be recorded, moreover, that the appellants realistically did not contend that there had been the kind of clear ministerial statement which amounted to a definitive identification of what the Bill was intended to achieve.
The most that is contended for is that the passage of the Bill was marked by several references to the desirability of punishing counterfeiting.
No doubt it was.
But there is not suggested to be any point at which Parliament, or any individual speaker, confronted the suggested difference between fake goods (which the appellants here describe as true counterfeits) and grey market goods.
Still less is there any point at which it can be suggested that Parliament plainly confined itself to criminalising fake goods and abjured the criminalising of grey market goods.
In support of their contention that such a distinction was plainly intended, the appellants referred to observations made by Lord Nicholls and Lord Walker in R v Johnstone upon the differences between counterfeit goods, pirated goods, and bootlegged goods.
Those observations arose, however, in the context of the case in which they were spoken.
The defendant was charged with offences against section 92(1)(c).
The offences were said to have arisen out of his possession for sale of compilation compact discs comprising songs which had covertly been recorded at concerts given by well known artistes.
The compact discs referred to the artistes by name, track by track, and the artiste had in each case registered his name as a trade mark.
The issue was whether the use of the name was, in the particular circumstances, one which might be taken by the buying public as an indication of authorised origin of the disc, as distinct from identifying the singer.
That was a question of fact, but unless it was demonstrated that the use of the name would be taken as an indication of origin, there would be no civil liability for trade mark infringement, and the decision of the House was that in that event there could be no criminal liability either.
It was in that context that Lord Nicholls referred at paragraph 1 to counterfeit goods as cheap imitations of the authentic article; that was said to distinguish that case from pirated music, which is music marketed without any trade mark, although recorded from a trade marked disc, and from bootlegged music, which is what Mr Johnstone had.
Likewise, Lord Walker, at para 59, referred to counterfeiting as an expression generally used to include unauthorised sale, under a well known trade mark, of goods not made or authorised by the proprietor.
Neither of their Lordships was addressing what is here said to be the critical difference between fake goods and unauthorised goods on the grey market.
Their observations came, moreover, years after the passage of the 1994 Act, and could not have been in mind at the time of its passing.
The appellants are correct that, in the context of goods which a proprietor voluntarily puts into the European single market with his trade mark attached, section 12 of the 1994 Act, transposing article 7 of Directive 89/104/EEC, has the effect that further objection to the use of the mark is limited to special cases, such as changes or impairments to the goods.
But that is true whichever of the rival constructions of section 92 is correct.
Where it applies, this concept of exhaustion means that there is no infringement of the mark as a matter of civil law, and thus no criminal offence.
But this sheds no light on the correct construction of section 92.
The appellants further drew attention to the wording of the predecessor of section 92, section 58A of the Trade Marks Act 1938.
This had provided: 58A.(l) It is an offence, subject to subsection (3) below, for a person (a) to apply a mark identical to or nearly resembling a registered trade mark to goods, or to material used or intended to be used for labelling, packaging or advertising goods, or (b) hire, or distribute to sell, let for hire, or offer or expose for sale or goods bearing such a mark, or (i) (ii) material bearing such a mark which is used or intended to be used for labelling, packaging or advertising goods, or (c) to use material bearing such a mark in the course of a business for labelling, packaging or advertising goods, or to possess in the course of a business goods or (d) material bearing such a mark with a view to doing any of the things mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c), when he is not entitled to use the mark in relation to the goods in question and the goods are not connected in the course of trade with a person who is so entitled. (3) A person commits an offence under subsection (1) or (2) only if (a) he acts with a view to gain for himself or another, or with intent to cause loss to another, and (b) he intends that the goods in question should be accepted as connected in the course of trade with a person entitled to use the mark in question; and it is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) to show that he believed on reasonable grounds that he was entitled to use the mark in relation to the goods in question.
This section provided, in subsection (3), for a more stringent test of mental element than does the present section 92.
The appellants invite us to conclude that the earlier, more stringent, mental element may have had the practical effect of confining criminal liability to cases of their category of true counterfeits, and they say that a change in that effect is not demonstrated to have been intended by the 1994 Act.
The difficulty with that is that whilst it is certainly true that the mental element was more stringent, the 1938 Act would still have caught so called grey market goods, for paragraph (1)(b) clearly applied to goods which were sold when sale was unauthorised, whether or not the original application of the mark had been permitted.
Moreover, it is noticeable that the construction now contended for of section 92(1)(b) could not have been applied to section 58A(1)(b) without considerable difficulty, for the words giving effect to the element of absence of consent of the trademark proprietor did not appear at the beginning of the section as they now do, but only at the end; hence it would have been even more problematical to suggest that such a mark imported them.
It is plain enough that the inversion of the order of the words was a grammatical rather than a substantive variation.
Nor is there any reason to strain the language of section 92(1)(b) so as to exclude the sale of grey market goods.
That is not because of the consequentialist arguments pressed on us by the Crown.
It is doubtful that (absurdities or impossibilities apart) difficulties in assembling evidence can ordinarily affect the construction of a criminal statute.
Moreover, some of the supposedly adverse consequences of such a construction which were put before us on behalf of the Crown would be as likely to ensue even on the correct interpretation of the Act set out above.
The possible difficulty of distinguishing, where there has been an overrun, between the goods marketed with the proprietors authority and those which were a backdoor venture on the part of the manufacturer and subsellers, might as well arise on both constructions; no doubt in many cases the circumstances of the exit from the factory and of the subsequent sales will often be telling.
Likewise it is far from clear that there will be greater difficulty occasioned by the appellants suggested construction than by the correct one in the case of convincing fakes.
In both cases the defendant may occasionally be in a position to assert that he was taken in and thus reasonably believed that no infringement was involved.
Such a defence, if advanced, must be met on its merits, which will no doubt involve investigation of, inter alia, the circumstances in which the defendant acquired the goods and the inquiries which he did or did not make.
But, these consequentialist arguments apart, it is, on any view, unlawful for a person in the position of the defendants to put grey goods on the market just as it is to put fake ones there.
Both may involve deception of the buying public; the grey market goods may be such because they are defective.
The distinction between the two categories is by no means cut and dried.
But both are, in any event, clear infringements of the rights of the trade mark proprietor.
Defendants who set out to buy up grey market goods to make a profit on re sale do so because the object is to cash in on someone elses trade mark.
If such be proved, they have scant claim to a beneficent construction of the Act.
As it is, its ordinary reading plainly means that, unless they have the statutory defence, they have committed an offence.
In the alternative, the appellants contend that the Crowns construction of section 92(1) involves a disproportionate breach of their rights under article 1, Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights.
It may be accepted that it is perfectly possible that the imposition of a criminal sanction might be disproportionate where a civil law sanction is not.
But persons in the position of these defendants have no proprietary right in the trade marks.
They do have a right in the goods which they have bought, but the 1994 Act does not stop them selling them, except if they wish to do so whilst still with the misleading and infringing trade mark attached.
The 1994 Act does not, therefore, deprive the defendants of any property which they have.
The most it does is to regulate their use or the manner of their disposal of the goods, which is permitted under the second paragraph of article 1 in the general interest, which must include a general interest in the protection of trade marks.
There is in any event nothing disproportionate in the 1994 Act penalising sales when the infringing trade mark is still attached, nor in imposing a criminal sanction on those who might otherwise calculate that the risk of liability in damages is worth taking.
That is a perfectly legitimate balance to draw between the rights of the proprietor to protect his valuable trademark and goodwill, and those of the person who wishes to sell goods which he has bought.
For these several reasons, these appeals must be dismissed and the trial may proceed accordingly.
","This is an interlocutory appeal in a criminal case in which the appellants are defendants indicted for offences of unauthorised use of trademarks, contrary to section 92(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (the 1994 Act).
An offence is committed under that section where a person does any of the following three things (with the intent to gain or to cause loss, and without the consent of the trademark proprietor): (a) applies to goods a sign identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark, (b) sells goods which bear such a sign, or (c) possesses in the course of a business any such goods with a view to committing an offence under (b).
The allegations against the appellants (which have yet to be proved) are that they are engaged in the bulk import and subsequent sale of goods bearing registered trademarks, manufactured abroad, in countries outside the EU.
A significant portion of the goods said to be sold by the appellants were manufactured (and the trademark applied) with the permission of the trademark proprietor, but were then sold without the trademark proprietors consent (for example because the goods were in excess of the numbers or below the quality permitted by the trademark proprietor).
The appellant describes these as grey market goods and distinguishes them from true counterfeits manufactured without the authorisation of the trademark proprietor.
At a preparatory hearing in the Crown Court, the appellants argued that while the sale of grey goods attracts civil liability, it is not covered by the offence in s.92(1), which properly construed applies only to true counterfeits.
The appellants argued that such a sign in subsection (1)(b) refers back to (1)(a), so that 1(b) applies only to goods where the trademark has been applied without the consent of the proprietor.
Any goods in the grey market category have had the trademark originally applied with the consent of the proprietor.
It is only the sale which the proprietor has not authorised.
It follows, they contend, that they are not, when it comes to paragraph (b), goods which bear such a sign.
Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) rejected that submission.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeals.
Lord Hughes gives the lead judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees.
So called grey market goods are caught by the criminal offence in s.92(1), and the appellants contended construction of that section must be rejected.
The plain reading of such a sign in (1)(b) is that it refers back to the sign mentioned in (1)(a) i.e. a sign which is identical to, or likely to be mistaken for, a registered trade mark. 1(b) therefore covers the unauthorised sale of any
goods bearing a trademark (regardless of whether the trademark was applied to the goods in their manufacture with consent or not).
But this reference back to (1)(a) does not also incorporate into the meaning of such a sign the commission of an offence under (1)(a), i.e. the requirement that the sign has been applied without the consent of the proprietor.
Such a reading of (1)(b) is strained and unnatural and requires one to read such sign as such a sign, so applied.
The offences set out in (a), (b) and (c) are not cumulative, but separate, and the requirement in the opening lines of s.92(1) that the use made of the sign is without the consent of the proprietor applies to each type of use specified whether it is the application of a trademark to goods, the sale of goods bearing a trademark, or the possession for sale of goods bearing a trademark. [8 12] The predecessor of section 92, section 58A of the Trademarks Act 1938, also plainly covered grey market goods.
The appellants contention therefore that the more stringent test for intention in s.58A had the practical effect of confining criminal liability to cases of their category of true counterfeits must be rejected. [16 17] There is therefore no ambiguity in the language of the section to justify investigating the Parliamentary debate at the passing of the 1994 Act.
In any event, the appellants did not contend that Parliament considered a difference between true counterfeits and grey market goods.
Still less is there any point at which it can be suggested that Parliament plainly confined itself to criminalising fake goods and abjured the criminalising of grey market goods.
The authorities relied on by the appellants in support of their contention that such a distinction was plainly intended do not assist here, as they were not addressing any difference between fake goods and unauthorised goods on the grey market, and moreover came years after the passage of the 1994 Act so could not have been in mind at the time of its passing. [13 14] The appellants are correct that in the context of goods which a proprietor voluntarily puts into the European single market with his trademark attached, section 12 of the 1994 Act, transposing article 7 of Directive 89/104/EEC, has the effect that further objection to the use of the mark is limited to special cases, such as changes or impairments to the goods.
But that is true whichever of the rival constructions of section 92 is correct.
Where it applies, this concept of exhaustion means that there is no infringement of the mark as a matter of civil law, and thus no criminal offence.
But this sheds no light on the correct construction of section 92. [15] There is no reason to strain the construction of s.92(1) to exclude the sale of grey market goods.
This is not because of the supposedly adverse consequences which the Crown argued would follow, some of which would be as likely to ensue even on the correct interpretation of the section.
The distinction between the two categories suggested by the appellant is not cut and dried, but both are clear infringements of the rights of the trademark proprietor.
The plain meaning of the Act is that it is unlawful to put grey goods on the market just as it is to put fake ones on there.
In both cases the trader is setting out to profit from someone elses trademark without permission. [18] In the alternative, the appellants contend that the Crowns construction of section 92(1) involves a disproportionate breach of their rights under article 1, Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights.
But the 1994 Act does not deprive them of their property, as it does not stop them selling the goods, except if they wish to do so whilst still with the misleading and infringing trademark attached.
Such regulation of use or disposal of goods is permitted under the second paragraph of article 1 in the general interest, and is in any event a proportionate measure, striking a legitimate balance between the rights of the proprietor to protect his valuable trademark, and those of the person who wishes to sell good which he has bought.

"
uksc-2012-0181,"Para 352D of the Immigration Rules provides for the grant of leave to enter to the child of a parent who has been admitted to the UK as a refugee.
The issue in this case is whether the Para extends, or should be treated as extending, to a child for whom a family member has taken parental responsibility under the Islamic procedure known as Kafala (described in the agreed statement of issues as a process of legal guardianship akin to adoption).
The facts are fully set out in the judgment of Davis LJ in the Court of Appeal.
The following is a sufficient summary for present purposes. i) AA was born in Somalia on 21 August 1994.
Her family was torn apart by events in Somalia.
Her father was killed in the mid 1990s. ii) An elder sister, Ms A, married Mohamed on 10 January 2001.
In 2002 she came home to find that he, her daughter Fadima, and her step daughter Amaani had been abducted.
She eventually left Somalia and came to the United Kingdom in October 2002.
She was later granted indefinite leave to remain, on compassionate grounds.
Her husband had in the meantime escaped from his abductors and had gone to live elsewhere in Mogadishu. iii) AA became separated from her mother and other siblings during the fighting.
Around the end of 2002 she went to live with Mohamed, Fadima and Amaani and was accepted as a family member. iv) In October 2007 Mohamed left Somalia, and came to the United Kingdom in November 2007, where he was reunited with Ms A.
He was granted asylum on 21 July 2008.
The three girls AA, Fadima and Amaani were left with a maternal aunt in Mogadishu. v) At the end of 2008 the three girls went to live with neighbours.
Contact with Ms A and Mohamed was renewed in March 2009.
Applications for entry into the UK were made for all three girls.
Entry clearance was granted to Fadima and Amaani, who came to the United Kingdom on 22 January 2010. (I shall refer to them for convenience, and without legal implications, as AAs adoptive siblings.) It was refused for AA, who remained in Addis Ababa pending her appeal. vi) Her appeal was heard in the First tier Tribunal on 3 September 2010.
Expert evidence, accepted by the tribunal, was to the effect that, although adoption as such does not exist under Islamic law, under the legal institution known as Kafala, a person may become a protg and part of the household of an adult; and that this only falls short of a full blown adoption in that such adoptee does not enjoy a right of inheritance under Islamic law (FTT para 21). vii) The tribunal allowed the appeal both under para 352D and article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the former on the basis that AA falls into a specific category of persons who have been taken into guardianship or the care of others under a transfer of responsibility such that Islamic law would recognise the legal status of the appellant in relation to [Ms A and Mohamed] as their child for all purposes and in the circumstances in which the appellant was an orphan. (para 31) viii) On 23 May 2011, the Upper Tribunal (Judge Grubb) allowed the Secretary of States appeal in respect of para 352D, but confirmed the tribunals decision under article 8.
On 14 May 2012 AA was given entry clearance and she arrived in this country on 4 June 2012.
The Court of Appeal accepted that notwithstanding the grant of entry clearance under article 8, the appeal was not academic.
The answer provided is that if entry is permitted under the Immigration Rules the entitlement of AA to remain thereafter will in effect align with the sponsor's entitlement, whereby indefinite leave to remain can be expected to be granted after the expiry of the five year period: whereas grant of leave to remain under article 8 is discretionary and not necessarily so linked to the sponsor's position.
In this court, Mr Gill has provided further details of the differences, legal and practical, between clearance under the rules and discretionary leave to remain (DLR) under article 8.
For example, under policies current at the time a person admitted under article 8 would take longer to reach the point of claiming indefinite leave to remain (ILR) than a person admitted under the rules.
Mr Gill submits that DLR status is not easily understood by employers, educational institutions and others with whom the holder will need to have dealings in ordinary life.
He pointed to other practical disadvantages, such as in relation to travel documents.
Some of his points were contentious.
However, it was not in dispute as I understand it that AAs status, following admission under article 8, might be materially less advantageous than that of someone (such as her adoptive siblings) admitted under Para 352D.
The Rules
The critical provision is Para 352D, in Part 11 of the Immigration Rules which relates to asylum: 352D.
The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom in order to join or remain with the parent who is currently a refugee granted status as such under the immigration rules in the United Kingdom are that the applicant: (i) is the child of a parent who is currently a refugee granted status as such under the immigration rules in the United Kingdom; and (ii) is under the age of 18, and (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent family unit; and (iv) was part of the family unit of the person granted asylum at the time that the person granted asylum left the country of his habitual residence in order to seek asylum;
The principal issue which arises in AAs case is whether her relationship with her brother in law Mohamed can be regarded as that of the child of a parent (under (i)).
For that it is necessary to turn to the interpretation provision, Para 6, which defines parent as follows: a parent includes: (a) the stepfather of a child whose father is dead and the reference to stepfather includes a relationship arising through civil partnership; (b) the stepmother of a child whose mother is dead and the reference to stepmother includes a relationship arising through civil partnership and; (c) the father as well as the mother of an illegitimate child where he is proved to be the father; (d) an adoptive parent, where a child was adopted in accordance with a decision taken by the competent administrative authority or court in a country whose adoption orders are recognised by the United Kingdom or where a child is the subject of a de facto adoption in accordance with the requirements of Para 309A of these Rules (except that an adopted child or a child who is the subject of a de facto adoption may not make an application for leave to enter or remain in order to accompany, join or remain with an adoptive parent under Paras 297 303); (e) in the case of a child born in the United Kingdom who is not a British citizen, a person to whom there has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility on the ground of the original parent(s)' inability to care for the child.
Thus an adoptive parent under a de facto adoption is included, but subject to the requirements of Para 309A.
This is underlined in turn by the definition of adoption: adoption unless the contrary intention appears, includes a de facto adoption in accordance with the requirements of Para 309A of these Rules, and adopted and adoptive parent should be construed accordingly.
Para 309A is in Part 8 of the Immigration Rules relating to Family Members (in the particular group relating to children).
Its present form dates from 2003.
It provides so far as relevant: 309A For the purposes of adoption under Paras 310 316C a de facto adoption shall be regarded as having taken place if: (a) at the time immediately preceding the making of the application for entry clearance under these Rules the adoptive parent or parents have been living abroad (in applications involving two parents both must have lived abroad together) for at least a period of time equal to the first period mentioned in sub Para (b)(i) and must have cared for the child for at least a period of time equal to the second period material in that sub Para; and (b) during their time abroad, the adoptive parent or parents have: (i) lived together for a minimum period of 18 months, of which the 12 months immediately preceding the application for entry clearance must have been spent living together with the child; and (ii) have assumed the role of the child's parents, since the beginning of the 18 month period, so that there has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility.
Paras 310 316C (referred to in the opening words) form a group of Paras under the general heading Adopted Children, dealing with the general requirements for entry as an adopted child, unconnected with circumstances which might lead to an asylum claim.
We were given little information about the thinking behind these rules, either in the present form, or as introduced in 2000.
Before 2000 a more flexible approach had been applied.
In R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal Ex p Tohur Ali [1988] 2 FLR 523, the Court of Appeal considered rule 50 as it then stood, under which parent was defined as including an adoptive parent, where there has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility on the ground of the original parents inability to care for the child The court, by a majority, held that this expression was not confined to adoption under a legally recognizable adoptive process.
Para 352D was originally introduced in October 2000, at the same time as the Human Rights Act 1998 came into effect.
At that time the relevant part of the definition of parent in Para 6 included an adoptive parent but only where a child was adopted in accordance with a decision taken by a competent administrative authority or court in a country whose adoption orders are recognised by the United Kingdom (except where an application for leave to enter or remain is made under Paras 310 316).
HC 538 of 31 March 2003 altered the definition of parent to its present form and introduced Para 309A.
We were not given any explanation for these changes, but neither side relies on them as throwing any light on the issue we have to decide.
Para 352D was considered by the Court of Appeal in MK (Somalia) v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] Imm AR 386.
It had been argued that, notwithstanding the introduction of the new rule, reliance could be placed on a free standing policy, outside the rules, expressed in a Ministerial Statement dated 17 March 1995, under which following grant of asylum status to a parent reunion of the immediate family would be permitted as a concession outside the rules.
The court held that this policy had been supplanted by the rules in their amended form.
Discussion
As I understand them, Mr Gills submissions, carefully and fully developed in his printed case and in oral argument, have three main strands: i) Construction To make sense of Para 352D in the context of the family of a refugee, the definitions must be interpreted broadly so as to include a child in the position of AA. ii) International obligations Effect must be given to the UKs international obligations relating to the treatment of children, including a broad approach to the recognition of adoptive children. iii) Discrimination Children who are members of a family unit should not be put at a disadvantage because they come from countries which have no formal system of adoption.
Construction
I would accept that the requirements of Para 309A (b)(i) and (ii) seem ill adapted to the purposes of Para 352D.
They assume a degree of stability in the home country which is likely to be wholly inappropriate to those like AA seeking refuge from war torn Somalia, and indeed for most asylum seekers.
Mr Eadie did not argue otherwise, although he suggested some theoretical scenarios in which the requirements might be achievable.
As appears from its introduction the definition seems to have been designed principally to deal with ordinary applications to enter by adopted children, covered by the immediately following Paras.
It finds its way into Para 352D by a somewhat circuitous route, which suggests that careful thought may not have been given to its practical implications.
If there were any way in which we could legitimately rewrite the rule to produce a fairer result, I could see a persuasive case for doing so.
Unfortunately I do not think this possible.
The correct approach to construction of the rules is well settled, as explained by Lord Brown in Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2010] 1 WLR 48: The Rules are not to be construed with all the strictness applicable to the construction of a statute or a statutory instrument but, instead, sensibly according to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used, recognising that they are statements of the Secretary of State's administrative policy the court's task is to discover from the words used in the Rules what the Secretary of State must be taken to have intended that intention is to be discerned objectively from the language used, not divined by reference to supposed policy considerations. (para 10)
Read in accordance with those principles, it is clear to my mind that Para 352D does not cover AAs case, and cannot be rewritten in order to do so.
Whether or not Kafala could be treated as a form of adoption for other purposes, the definition of adoptive parent in Para 6 is more restricted.
It extends to de facto adoption only within the limitations laid down by Para 309A, which do not cover this case.
Although in terms directed to the succeeding provisions, the definition is also incorporated specifically into the general definition of adoptive parent and hence into that of parent in Para 6.
Mr Gill sought to make something, first, of the fact that the definition of parent is expressed as inclusive, and, secondly, of the words unless the contrary intention appears in the definition of adoption.
Neither point assists.
The word includes in the definition of parent is readily explicable, having regard to the fact that the particular Paras do not include a biological parent.
They are rather designed to extend the natural meaning of the term.
The specific treatment of adoption in Para (d) excludes any intention to cover other forms of de facto adoption outside the definition.
Similarly, the reference to contrary intention in the definition of adoption, in context, cannot be read as designed to extend the scope of the definition, but rather to indicate that there may be contexts in which the extension to de facto adoption does not apply.
On this aspect, I cannot usefully add to the reasoning of Davis LJ said in the Court of Appeal.
As he said, the wording of the rules is plain and unambiguous.
International obligations
Mr Gill has referred us to a number of international instruments which call for a broad approach to the protection of the interests of children.
As he rightly says, the best interests principle is now, in appropriate areas of law, recognised both by domestic and international law (see ZH(Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] 2 AC 166).
Without in any way detracting from the importance of the principles affirmed in those instruments, I do not find it necessary to review them in any detail.
Taking them at their highest, Mr Gill is unable to point to any specific obligation covering the position of someone in the position of AA in the present case.
LJ concluded: In response to similar submissions in MK (Somalia) (above), Maurice Kay Do these documents establish or evidence an obligation of customary international law that is positively protective of de facto adopted children? In my judgment they do not.
At best they illustrate an increasing awareness of the need for a flexible approach to the concept of family but they do not address in terms the question of de facto adoption which, because of its very lack of formality, presents a receiving state with obvious problems of verification.
There is no material referred to by Mr Pleming which demonstrates a clear international consensus about the particular problem of de facto adoption quite the contrary.
Whilst there is a perceptible concern that the concept of family, in the context of family reunion, should not be resistant to social and cultural change, I do not consider that there is a precise, identifiable obligation of customary international law that is prescriptive of the national approach to de facto adoption. (para 12) I respectfully agree.
Mr Gill also referred us to Secretary of State for Home Department v Abdi [1996] Imm AR 148.
The Court of Appeal noted a Home Office letter dated 17 May 1990 relating to Somali Family Reunion Applications, which included the following: 8.1.1 If the United Kingdom sponsor has been recognised as a refugee here under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees then, like most countries, we follow the policy on family reunion agreed by the Conference which adopted the Convention.
We will agree to the admission of the spouse and minor children of the refugee.
However given the nature of the Somali family we are prepared to be flexible and if a refugee is able to show that a person not covered by the policy was a dependent member of the refugee's immediate family unit before the refugee came to the United Kingdom, then we would be prepared to consider exceptionally extending the refugee family reunion provision to cover that person.
Although this is a clear recognition of the importance attached internationally to family reunion, it is equally clear that the more flexible approach proposed for Somali applicants is not treated as a matter of legal obligation, but as a matter for exceptional consideration.
In that respect Mr Gill faces a further difficulty.
It is accepted by the Secretary of State that the rules on this issue are not exhaustive of this countrys obligations under international law.
Hence the decision to allow AA entry under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Subject to the issue of discrimination, to which I will come, Mr Gill is unable to point to any international obligation which goes further in practical terms than the protection which has been afforded to AA under human rights law.
Discrimination
Mr Gill relies on what he calls the principle of non discrimination as recognised in a number of international instruments, for example: i) UN Convention on the Rights of the Child article 2, under which states parties are required to ensure the rights in the Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind ii) The Refugee Convention, the preamble of which reaffirms the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination iii) The European Convention on Human Rights article 14, under which the rights set out in the Convention are to be secured without discrimination on any of the grounds there set out.
Mr Gill submits that the discrimination in this case arises on a number of grounds under article 14, including race, religion and nationality, and also (as he puts it in his printed case) other status (the statuses of being a child of a refugee and/or of being a de facto adopted child, ie a child who is not a biological child nor a child adopted in accordance with procedures recognised by the UK.)
I accept that it appears harsh, to put it no higher, that under the rules AA is treated less favourably than her adoptive siblings, largely because of the tragic circumstances in which parental responsibility passed to her brother in law, taken with the lack of any functioning legal system allowing for formal adoption in the country from which she comes.
It is however unnecessary to decide in the context of the present appeal whether or not such treatment could give rise to a claim for unlawful discrimination under article 14 or otherwise.
This is because any rights which AA has in that respect would apply equally to her position in this country, regardless of the basis of her admission.
Mr Gill did not suggest otherwise.
In exercising any discretion in relation to the grant or extension of DLR, the Secretary of State is obliged to act in conformity with the Convention, including article 14.
It is not necessary to reinterpret the rules to achieve that result.
I would add one comment.
As I have made clear, I see great force in Mr Gills criticisms of the use of the Para 309A definition in the context of a rule which is concerned with the treatment of refugees and their dependants.
Mr Eadies only answer, as I understood him, was that clear definitions were needed to establish bright lines.
That answer loses most of its force if the bright lines are drawn so restrictively that they have in practice to be supplemented by the much fuzzier lines drawn by article 8.
In the interests of both applicants and those administering the system, it seems much preferable that the rules should be amended to bring them into line with the practice actually operated by the Secretary of State, including that dictated by her obligations under international law.
Conclusion
For these reasons, which substantially follow those of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal.
","The issue in this appeal is whether AA falls within the definition of an adopted child in paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules.
AA was born in Somalia on 21 August 1994.
Her family were torn apart by events in Somalia and her father was killed in the mid 1990s.
AA became separated from her mother and other siblings during the fighting.
Around the end of 2002, she went to live with her brother in law, Mohamed.
He had a daughter, Fadima and step daughter, Amaani.
Mohamed took AA into his family home under the Islamic procedure known as Kafala (described as a process of legal guardianship akin to adoption).
In October 2007, Mohamed left Somalia and came to the UK in November 2007.
He was granted asylum on 21 July 2008.
The three girls, AA, Fadima and Amaani, were left with a maternal aunt in Mogadishu.
An application for entry into the UK was made for all three girls.
Entry clearance was granted to Fadima and Amaani who came to the UK in January 2010.
It was refused for AA who remained in Addis Ababa pending her appeal.
Her appeal was heard in the First tier Tribunal (FTT) on 3 September 2010.
Exert evidence, accepted by the tribunal, was to the effect that, although adoption as such does not exist under Islamic law, under the legal institution known as Kafala a person may become a protg and a part of the household of an adult; and that this only falls short of a full blown adoption in that such adoptee does not enjoy a right of inheritance under Islamic law.
The FTT allowed the appeal both under paragraph 352D and article 8 ECHR (right to respect for private and family life).
The Secretary of State appealed.
The Upper Tribunal (UT) allowed the Secretary of States appeal in respect of paragraph 352D but confirmed the FTTs decision under article 8.
On 2 May 2012, the Court of Appeal confirmed the UTs decision.
On 14 May 2012, AA was given entry clearance and she arrived in the UK on 4 June 2012.
AA appeals to the Supreme Court in respect of paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules.
The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.
Lord Carnwath gives the lead judgment, with which Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lord Reed and Lord Hughes agree.
The correct approach to construction of the rules is well settled, as explained by Lord Brown in Mahed v Entry Clearance Officer [2010] 1 WLR 48.
Read in accordance with those principles, it is clear that paragraph 352D does not cover AAs case and cannot be rewritten in order to do so [14 15].
Whether or not Kafala could be treated as a form of adoption for other purposes, the definition of adoptive parent in paragraph 6 is more restricted.
It extends to de facto adoption only within the limitations laid down by paragraph 309A, which does not cover this case [15 16].
A number of international instruments call for a broad approach to the protection of the interests of children.
The best interests principle is now, in appropriate areas of law, recognised both by domestic and international law [17].
However, taking them at their highest, there is no specific obligation covering the position of AA [18].
Subject to the issue of discrimination, there is no international obligation which goes further in practical terms than the protection which has been afforded to AA under human rights law [21].
It appears harsh that under the rules AA is treated less favourably than her adoptive siblings, largely because of the tragic circumstances in which parental responsibility passed to her brother in law, taken with the lack of any functioning legal system allowing for formal adoption in the country from which she comes.
However, it is unnecessary to decide in the context of the present appeal whether or not such treatment could give rise to a claim for unlawful discrimination under article 14 ECHR or otherwise.
This is because any rights which AA has in that respect would apply equally to her position in this country, regardless of the basis of her admission.
In exercising any discretion in relation to the grant or extension of definite leave to remain, the Secretary of State is obliged to act in conformity with the Convention, including article 14.
It is not necessary to reinterpret the rules to achieve that result [24].
"
uksc-2012-0072,"Where an application is made for the extradition of a convicted person to a category 1 territory, ie pursuant to a European arrest warrant, the warrant is required by section 2(6)(e) of the Extradition Act 2003 to include particulars of the sentence which has been imposed under the law of the category 1 territory in respect of the offence, if the person has been sentenced for the offence.
The purpose of this requirement is to enable the court to apply section 65(2)(c), (3)(c), (4)(c) and (5)(c).
These provide minimum sentences of imprisonment or detention which must have been imposed in order to disclose an extradition offence.
The minimum periods are 12 months in the case of offences on the European Framework list or four months for offences which are not on the European Framework list but satisfy the relevant requirement of double criminality.
In the present case, the relevant provision is section 65(3)(c), which applies to offences committed in the category 1 territory which would constitute an offence under the law of the relevant part of the United Kingdom if it occurred there, provided that a sentence of imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of four months or a greater punishment has been imposed.
In many states of the European Union the criminal law provides for the aggregation of successive sentences imposed by criminal courts on different occasions so as to produce a single sentence reflecting the totality of the course of criminality disclosed.
This will commonly result in a reduction of the total period of imprisonment imposed, by comparison with the period arrived at by adding up each of the original sentences.
Polands aggregation procedure is contained in articles 85 86 of the Penal Code and articles 569 577 of the Criminal Procedures Code, which require a court to aggregate successive sentences to produce a single cumulative penalty.
The effect of this procedure has been considered in a number of cases in which a European arrest warrant has given particulars of the cumulative penalty but not of the individual sentences which were aggregated so as to produce it.
The question whether this satisfies sections 2(6)(e) and 65(3)(c) of the Act was finally settled in Pilecki v Circuit Court of Legnica, Poland [2008] 1 WLR 325.
The House of Lords held that, at any rate in a case where each of the original sentences was for conduct satisfying all the other requirements for an extradition offence, it was enough for the warrant to specify the cumulative sentence.
If it exceeded four months it was irrelevant that some of the original sentences might have been less than that.
The present appeal concerns the converse situation.
What happens if the warrant specifies only the original sentences, but after it has been issued they have been aggregated and their totality reduced?
Lukasz Zakrzewski, was convicted on four occasions in Poland of various offences of dishonesty or violence.
On 10 December 2003, he was convicted by the District Court in Grudziadz of assault and robbery committed on separate occasions in February 2003, for which he received a combined sentence of 14 months imprisonment.
On 18 March 2004, he was convicted by the same court of two distinct offences of theft, and received a further combined sentence of 15 months imprisonment.
On 28 May 2004, he was convicted of theft by the District Court of Swiecle and sentenced to six months imprisonment.
On 14 January 2005, he was back before the District Court of Grudziadz, which convicted him of theft and sentenced him to a further ten months imprisonment.
All of these sentences of imprisonment were initially suspended, but all of them were subsequently activated either by the commission of further offences during the period of probation which followed conviction, or by breaches of the probation terms.
On 24 February 2010, Mr Zakrzewski having absconded, the Regional Court of Lodz issued a European Arrest Warrant against him, based on his conviction on these four occasions.
The warrant specified the sentence passed on each occasion.
Mr Zakrzewski was arrested in England on 28 September 2010 and brought before City of Westminster Magistrates Court on the same day.
At that time, he was facing further criminal charges in the United Kingdom.
The extradition proceedings were therefore adjourned pending the resolution of proceedings arising from them.
During the adjournment, Mr Zakrzewski applied to the District Court of Grudziadz to have the four sentences aggregated.
The court duly aggregated them, and on 19 April 2011 imposed a cumulative sentence of 22 months, as opposed to the aggregate of 45 months under the original sentences.
When Mr Zakrzewski came back before Westminster Magistrates on 20 May 2011, it was submitted on his behalf that the aggregation order meant that the warrant no longer gave the particulars required by section 2(6)(e) because the only relevant sentence was now the cumulative sentence.
It followed, so it was said, that the warrant had become invalid, or that the court should exercise an inherent jurisdiction not to proceed with the extradition on the ground that it no longer gave proper, fair or accurate particulars: see Criminal Court at the National High Court, First Division v Murua [2010] EWHC 2609 (Admin).
It will be noted that each of the original sentences was for conduct in Poland which would have been criminal if it had occurred in England, and that the original sentences and the cumulative sentence all exceeded four months.
The argument advanced on Mr Zakrzewskis behalf is therefore hardly overburdened with merit.
It is about as technical as it could possibly be.
It is common ground that a further warrant giving the same particulars but specifying the cumulative sentence would be good.
District Judge Rose rejected the argument in both its forms and made the extradition order.
But it was accepted in both forms by Lloyd Jones J on appeal to the High Court.
He allowed the appeal against the extradition order on 7 February 2012.
In summary, he held that the information in the warrant must relate to the current operative sentence and not to earlier sentences which have been subsumed in an aggregated order.
In determining whether the requirement of section 65 is satisfied, the court needs to know the total length of time which the court of the requesting state has ordered must be served in prison.
In the present case, that is the aggregated order.: [2012] 1 WLR 2248, para 26.
The basic features of the scheme for the execution of a European arrest warrant under Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003 are too familiar to need extensive restatement here.
It has often been pointed out that the contents of the warrant are critical to the operation of the scheme of both the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 and the United Kingdom Act.
Extradition under Part 1 of the Act is by way of direct execution of the warrant.
To fall within the definition of a Part 1 warrant and be capable of initiating extradition proceedings, it must contain the statements and information required by section 2 of the Act, which reflect the mandatory contents provided for by article 8 of the Framework Decision.
The procedure operates at each stage by reference to the prescribed particulars contained in it.
Thus, under section 10, the court must decide whether the offence specified in the Part 1 warrant is an extradition offence as defined by section 64 (in an accusation case) or section 65 (in a conviction case).
Both sections require the court to consider whether the offence constituted by the conduct satisfied the requirements of those sections.
The conduct for this purpose means that specified in the warrant, and it is not permissible to conduct an independent examination of the elements of the offence under the law of the requesting state: Office of the Kings Prosecutor, Brussels v Cando Armas [2006] 2 AC 1, paras 16 (Lord Bingham of Cornhill) and 30 (Lord Hope of Craighead).
Under section 64(2)(b) and (c), the questions whether the conduct falls within the European Framework list and whether it is punishable under the law of the requesting state by a sentence of imprisonment of three years or more are to be determined by reference to information certified by the requesting authority, which may be (and commonly is) certified in the warrant itself: see Dabas v High Court of Justice in Madrid, Spain [2007] 2 AC 31.
The same applies to the corresponding provisions of section 65(2)(b) and (c).
If the warrant contains the prescribed particulars and these disclose an extradition offence, the court must extradite the defendant, unless one of the limited exceptions specified in the Act applies.
The exceptions to the otherwise mandatory extradition of the defendant are dealt with by sections 10 to 21 and 25 of the Act.
Some of these also operate by reference to the conduct, which must in the circumstances mean the conduct specified in the warrant: see sections 15 and 19B (as inserted by section 42 of, and para 4(2) of Schedule 13 to, the Police and Justice Act 2006).
All of these provisions reflect the underlying purpose of the Framework Decision and Part 1 of the Extradition Act to create a simplified and accelerated procedure based on the mutual recognition by the requested state of the antecedent decision to issue the warrant by the judicial authority in the requesting state.
Recital (10) of the Framework Decision records that the mechanism of the European arrest warrant is based on a high level of confidence between member states.
Or, as Lord Phillips put it in Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority (Nos 1 & 2) [2012] 2 AC 471, para 79, under the scheme of the Framework Decision the safeguard against the inappropriate issue of an EAW lies in the process antecedent to the issue of the EAW.
It follows that the scheme of the Framework Decision and of Part 1 of the 2003 Act is that as a general rule the court of the executing state is bound to take the statements and information in the warrant at face value.
The validity of the warrant depends on whether the prescribed particulars are to be found in it, and not on whether they are correct.
It cannot be open to a defendant to challenge the validity of a warrant which contains the prescribed particulars by reference to extraneous evidence tending to show that those statements and information are wrong.
If this is true of statements and information in a warrant which were wrong at the time of issue, it must necessarily be true of statements which were correct at the time of issue but ceased to be correct as a result of subsequent events.
Validity is not a transient state.
A warrant is either valid or not.
It cannot change from one to the other over time.
It does not, however, follow from this that there is nothing to be done about it if the prescribed particulars in the warrant are or have become incorrect.
It only means that the remedy must be found at the stage when the court is considering whether to extradite.
Neither the Framework Decision nor Part 1 of the Act provides in terms for non extradition on the ground of a factual error in the warrant.
There are, however, two safeguards against an unjustified extradition in those circumstances.
The first and main one is the mutual trust between states party to the Framework Decision that informs the entire scheme.
The requesting judicial authority has a right, recognised by article 15.3 of the Framework Decision, to forward additional information at any time.
These are receivable in evidence by an English court under section 202 of the Act on the same basis as the warrant itself.
If necessary, further information may be requested by the executing court under article 15.2.
The Framework Decision proceeds on the assumption that requesting states can be trusted to ensure that statements and information in a European arrest warrant are true.
By the same token, if they subsequently cease to be true, either the warrant will be withdrawn or the statements and information in it will be corrected by the provision of further information, with or without a request for it.
The second safeguard lies in the inherent right of an English court, as the executing court, to ensure that its process is not abused.
One form of abuse of process is the fortunately rare case in which the prosecutor has manipulated the process of the executing court for a collateral and improper purpose: see R (Government of the United States of America) v Bow Street Magistrates Court [2007] 1 WLR 1157.
We are not concerned with anything of that kind on this appeal.
Another category comprises cases, rather less rare, in which the prescribed particulars are given in the warrant but they are wrong.
In Caldarelli v Judge for Preliminary Investigations of the Court of Naples, Italy [2008] 1 WLR 1724, para 24, Lord Bingham observed that ""it might in some circumstances be necessary to question statements made in the EAW, notwithstanding the general rule.
The question is in what circumstances is the power envisaged by Lord Bingham exercisable.
The clearest statement of the principle is to be found in the decision of Sir Anthony May, President of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court, in Criminal Court at the National High Court, First Division v Murua [2010] EWHC 2609 (Admin), which has been followed by the High Court on a number of occasions.
Murua was an accusation case.
The warrant alleged serious terrorist offences involving danger to life and concealment of identity.
Both of these were significant aggravating factors under Spanish law, warranting imprisonment upon conviction for up to 48 years.
The particulars of the offence specified the aggravating factors, and the maximum sentence associated with them.
However, at the trial in Spain of seven other defendants for the same conduct, the prosecution had accepted that these aggravating factors could not be proved.
The charges were reformulated, and the co defendants convicted of lesser offences carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of three years.
Sir Anthony May said, at paras 58 59: 58.
The court's task jurisdiction, if you like is to determine whether the particulars required by section 2(4) have been properly given.
It is a task to be undertaken with firm regard to mutual co operation, recognition and respect.
It does not extend to a debatable analysis of arguably discrepant evidence, nor to a detailed critique of the law of the requesting state as given by the issuing judicial authority.
It may, however, occasionally be necessary to ask, on appropriately clear facts, whether the description of the conduct alleged to constitute the alleged extradition offence is fair, proper and accurate.
I understood Ms Cumberland to accept this, agreeing that it was in the end a matter of fact and degree.
She stressed, however, a variety of floodgates arguments with which in general I agree, that this kind of inquiry should not be entertained in any case where to do so would undermine the principles to be found in the introductory preambles to the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002. 59.
Ms Cumberland submitted that an argument of the kind which succeeded before the District Judge can be raised, but not with reference to section 2 of the 2003 Act.
She said that the proper approach was to deal with it as an abuse argument, and this ties in with the appellant's third ground of appeal, to which I shall come in a few moments.
I do not agree that the respondent's case could only be advanced as an abuse argument.
It can properly be advanced, as it was, as a contention that the description in the warrant of the conduct alleged did not sufficiently conform with the requirements set out in section 2 for the reasons advanced by Mr Summers with reference to Dabas v High Court of Justice in Madrid, Spain [2007] 2 AC 31 and Pilecki v Circuit Court of Legnica, Poland [2008] 1 WLR 325.
If that is shown, it is not a valid Part 1 warrant.
I agree with this statement, subject to four observations.
The first is that the jurisdiction is exceptional.
The statements in the warrant must comprise statutory particulars which are wrong or incomplete in some respect which is misleading (though not necessarily intentionally).
Secondly, the true facts required to correct the error or omission must be clear and beyond legitimate dispute.
The power of the court to prevent abuse of its process must be exercised in the light of the purposes of that process.
In extradition cases, it must have regard, as Sir Anthony May observed, to the scheme and purpose of the legislation.
It is not therefore to be used as an indirect way of mounting a contentious challenge to the factual or evidential basis for the conduct alleged in the warrant, this being a matter for the requesting court.
Third, the error or omission must be material to the operation of the statutory scheme.
No doubt errors in some particulars (such as the identity of the defendant or the offence charged) would by their very nature be material.
In other cases, the materiality of the error will depend on its impact on the decision whether or not to order extradition.
The fourth observation follows from the third.
In my view, Ms Cumberland was right to submit to Sir Anthony May in Murua that the sole juridical basis for the inquiry into the accuracy of the particulars in the warrant is abuse of process.
I do not think that it goes to the validity of the warrant.
This is because in considering whether to refuse extradition on the ground of abuse of process, the materiality of the error in the warrant will be of critical importance, whereas if the error goes to the validity of the warrant, no question of materiality can arise.
An invalid warrant is incapable of initiating extradition proceedings.
I do not think that it is consistent with the scheme of the Framework Decision to refuse to act on a warrant in which the prescribed particulars were included, merely because those particulars contain immaterial errors.
I now return to the facts of Mr Zakrzewskis case.
The warrant issued against him was undoubtedly a valid warrant when it was issued.
It was therefore effective to authorise the commencement of extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom against him.
It did not become invalid when the aggregation order was made.
It follows that the only basis on which Mr Zakrzewski could object to his extradition was that the conduct of the requesting judicial authority in persisting with extradition proceedings after the aggregation order was an abuse of those proceedings.
The short answer to this contention in the present case is that the particulars of the sentence in the warrant, although no longer complete, were not wrong.
This is because the Regional Court of Lodz supplied further information about the effect of the aggregation order in the following terms: The consequence of a composite sentence having been passed is that the single penalties imposed for each of the offences are replaced by that single composite sentence.
In such a case, the penalties imposed for each of the offences are not to be enforced separately, but replaced with the new composite sentence that is to be enforced in respect of the convict.
It should be noted that the issue of a composite sentence does not invalidate any of the individual sentences.
This answer was effective to explain the contents of the warrant.
Its effect is that the original sentences remain valid but the cumulative sentence determines what period of imprisonment will be treated as satisfying them.
Therefore, the information in the warrant about the original sentences did not cease to be true when the cumulative sentence was passed.
Although true, the information in the warrant about the sentence imposed became incomplete when the cumulative sentence was passed.
The prosecution of extradition proceedings on a warrant containing prescribed particulars which are (or have become) incomplete is capable of being an abuse of process, but only if the information omitted is material to the operation of the statutory scheme.
In this case the fact that the period of imprisonment which would satisfy the four original sentences had been shortened was wholly immaterial, because even the shorter cumulative sentence was substantially longer than the minimum of four months.
As Lord Hope observed in Pilecki [2008] 1 WLR 325, para 29, all the executing court needs to know in these circumstances is whether or not the sentence was one for at least four months.
The position would be different if the composite sentence was below the four month threshold, because there would then be no extradition offence.
I cannot agree with Lloyd Jones J [2012] 1 WLR 2248, para 26 that the failure of the warrant to specify the current operative sentence was fatal.
The sentence of the court will rarely be the current operative sentence, since the period to be served will commonly be affected by a variety of factors, such as remission or parole.
As the cases on aggregation procedure show, they may also be affected by aspects of criminal procedure which will vary from one jurisdiction to another without affecting the application of the ordinary criteria for extradition or undermining the purpose of the Framework Decision or Part I of the Act.
It follows that in the ordinary course the appeal would have been allowed and the order of the District Judge restored.
However, just before this judgment was due to be delivered, the Court was informed that Mr. Zakrzewski had returned voluntarily to Poland after the argument on the appeal and been arrested there.
Accordingly, the warrant has been withdrawn by the court which issued it.
This does not affect the issue which the Court has to decide.
But it does mean that, formally, the appeal must now be dismissed: see section 43(4).
","Where an application for a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is made, and the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in the requesting state, section 2(6)(e) of the Extradition Act 2003 (the Act) requires the EAW to include particulars of the sentence(s) imposed.
This enables the requested court to determine whether the sentence is equal to or exceeds the minimum sentence required to constitute an extradition offence.
Section 65(3)(c) of the Act applies to offences in the requesting state which would constitute an offence in the UK if it occurred there, provided that a minimum sentence of four months was imposed.
Many EU states provide for the aggregation of successive sentences imposed on different occasions to produce a single sentence for all of the offences committed, which usually has the effect of reducing the overall period of imprisonment.
Earlier case law establishes that where each of the original sentences is for conduct that satisfies all the other requirements of an extradition offence, it is enough for a EAW to specify the cumulative sentence rather than all of the individual sentences.
This appeal concerns the converse: what happens if a EAW specifies only the original sentences, but after it has been issued they are aggregated and their totality reduced? Lukasz Zakrzewski was convicted on four occasions in Poland of various offences of dishonesty or violence.
His sentences were initially suspended and then activated by further offences or breaches of probation terms.
On 24 February 2010, Mr Zakrzewski having absconded, the Regional Court in Lodz issued a EAW against him based on these four convictions specifying the sentences passed.
He was then arrested in England on 28 September 2010 and brought before the City of Westminster Magistrates Court the same day.
However, as he was facing further criminal charges in England, the extradition proceedings were adjourned.
During this adjournment, Mr Zakrzewski applied to the District Court of Grudziadz in Poland to have the four sentences aggregated.
The court duly aggregated them and on 19 April 2012 imposed a cumulative sentence of 22 months imprisonment (as opposed to the aggregate of 45 months of the original sentences).
When the extradition proceedings resumed, Mr Zakrzewski claimed that the aggregation order meant the EAW was no longer gave the particulars required by s.2(6)(e) because the only relevant sentence now included was the cumulative sentence.
The warrant was therefore invalid, and no longer gave proper, fair or accurate particulars.
District Judge Rose rejected Mr Zakrzewskis arguments and granted an extradition order.
However, this was overturned by Lloyd Jones J in the High Court on the basis that the EAW must relate to the current operative sentence in force not to earlier individual ones subsumed in an aggregated order to enable the requested court to know the length of imprisonment the requesting state had ordered.
The Regional Court in Lodz appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the extradition order of District Judge Rose.
Lord Sumption gives the judgment of the Court.
Just before this judgment was due to be delivered, the Court was informed that Mr. Zakrzewski had returned voluntarily to Poland after the argument on the appeal and been arrested there.
Accordingly, the warrant has been withdrawn by the court which issued it.
This does not affect the issue which the Court has to decide.
But it does mean that, formally, the appeal must now be dismissed: see section 43(4).
The purpose of the European Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 (the Framework Decision) and Part 1 of the Act was to create a simplified and accelerated procedure based on mutual recognition [7].
The courts of states being asked to consider EAWs should generally take information contained in them at face value.
An EAWs validity depends on whether the prescribed particulars are found in it, not on whether they are correct.
A defendant cannot normally challenge its validity by reference to extraneous evidence.
If this is true of information in an EAW which was wrong at the time of issue, it is true for information which was correct at the time of issue but ceased to be correct due to subsequent events.
A EAW is either valid or not valid.
It cannot change over time [8].
It does not follow that nothing can be done to correct prescribed particulars that have become incorrect but the remedy must be at the stage when the court is deciding whether to extradite [9].
Lord Sumption drew attention to two safeguards against unjustified extradition in this context.
The first was mutual trust between parties to the Framework Decision to ensure information in a EAW is true.
The requesting authority has the right to forward additional information at any time and the requested UK authority has the right to receive it and to request further information [10].
The second safeguard is the courts inherent right to ensure its process is not abused, for example, where an EAW has been obtained for improper purposes [11].
A court can question statements made in EAW on the grounds of an abuse of process.
However, Lord Sumption noted that: (a) this jurisdiction is exceptional; (b) the facts needed to correct the error must be beyond legitimate doubt and abuse of process must not become an indirect way of challenging the factual basis of conduct alleged in a EAW; (c) the error must be material to the operation of the statutory scheme.
It is inconsistent with the Framework Decision to refuse to execute a EAW, in which the prescribed particulars were included, because of immaterial errors [13].
In the present case, the EAW was valid when it was issued to Mr Zakrzewski.
It did not become invalid when the aggregation order was made.
The particulars of sentence were no longer complete but they were not wrong.
The evidence is that in Polish law the original sentences remain valid but the cumulative one determines what period of imprisonment will be treated as satisfying them [14].
The fact that the imprisonment period which would satisfy the four original sentences was shortened was immaterial, as even the shorter sentences were longer than the minimum of 4 months required for disclosing an extradition offence under the Act [15].
The sentence of the court will rarely be the current operative sentence since the period to be served will be affected by factors such as remission or parole as well as aggregation.
Criminal procedures vary from one jurisdiction to another without affecting the ordinary criteria for extradition or undermining the purpose of the Framework Decision or Part I of the Act [16].
"
uksc-2009-0129,"On 9 September 2004 the appellant, Steven Allison, was convicted after trial in the High Court at Glasgow of four contraventions of section 4(3)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
In effect, he was found guilty of being concerned in the supplying of cocaine and three other controlled drugs at his home in Cumbernauld, at an address in Falkirk and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, between 12 November and 3 December 2003.
The trial judge, Lord Bracadale, sentenced him to 8 years imprisonment.
The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence.
On 7 November 2008 the appeal court (Lord Osborne, Lady Paton and Lord Philip) refused his appeal against conviction, leaving his appeal against sentence to be heard on a date to be fixed.
Among his grounds of appeal against conviction was one which was first advanced in an additional Note of Appeal.
It relates to the record of a police interview of a John Stronach.
Mr Stronach had died before the trial and the Crown introduced the interview into evidence in accordance with the procedure in section 259(5) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.
Neither before nor during the trial did the Crown disclose to the defence that Mr Stronach had a number of previous convictions and outstanding charges.
In particular, he had convictions for reset, theft by opening lockfast places, assault and robbery and assault and breach of the peace.
He also had a number of outstanding charges, including two alleged contraventions of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, an alleged theft by housebreaking and several alleged contraventions of the Road Traffic Act 1988.
One of the outstanding cases under the Misuse of Drugs Act related to events covered by the trial and was known to the appellants legal advisers.
The Crown disclosed the previous convictions and the other outstanding charges only while the appellants appeal was pending before the appeal court.
This prompted the appellant to lodge his additional ground of appeal: The failure on the part of the Crown to disclose to the defence the existence of all the previous convictions and outstanding charges resulted in the defence being unable to prepare and properly conduct their defence and the result was that the appellant did not receive a fair trial, as guaranteed by article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Following the dismissal of his appeal by the appeal court, the appellant applied for leave to appeal to the Privy Council in relation to the additional ground of appeal.
On 6 March 2009 the appeal court (Lord Osborne, Lady Paton and Lord Mackay of Drumadoon) refused the application as incompetent, on the ground that no intimation of a devolution issue had been given to the Advocate General as required by para 5 of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998.
The court went on to indicate that, if it had been open to them to grant or refuse leave, they would not have granted leave.
The appellant subsequently applied to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal.
The Board granted special leave.
Although the statement of facts and issues included an issue relating to the competency of the appeal courts decision to refuse leave, neither the advocate depute nor the Advocate General advanced any argument on the point at the hearing of the appeal.
Undoubtedly, when the appeal court determined that the Lord Advocate was not under an obligation by virtue of article 6(1) of the European Convention to disclose the outstanding charges against Mr Stronach, they were in substance determining a devolution issue in terms of para 1(d) or (e) of Part I of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998 irrespective of whether all the relevant procedural steps had been followed.
It follows, as was held in McDonald v HM Advocate 2008 SLT 993, 1002, paras 48 and 49, that an appeal on that point lies to this Court under para 13(a) of Part II of that Schedule.
Of course, the late Mr Stronachs name was never included in the list of Crown witnesses appended to the indictment for the appellants trial which may help to explain why the need to disclose his criminal antecedents was overlooked.
But, when dismissing the appellants appeal, the appeal court rightly accepted, under reference to Holland v HM Advocate 2005 1 SC (PC) 3, 24, para 72, that the failure by the Crown to disclose Mr Stronachs previous convictions had been incompatible with the appellants article 6(1) Convention rights.
Despite the further conclusion of the Privy Council in Holland, at pp 24 25, paras 73 74, that the Crown were also under an obligation to disclose material outstanding charges of which they were aware, the appeal court in the present case drew a distinction between Mr Stronachs previous convictions and his outstanding cases at the time of the trial by which the court obviously meant the charges against him which had been outstanding at the time of his death.
The court continued: We consider that, in this context, a distinction has to be made between previous convictions and outstanding cases.
While, in appropriate circumstances, the existence of previous convictions may be of importance in connection with the preparation of a defence and to the challenge that may be mounted to the credibility of a witness, we do not consider that the same may be said of outstanding cases.
Where an individual is charged with crime, he or she is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty.
If a case is outstanding, necessarily no verdict has been reached in it.
In these circumstances we have insuperable difficulty in understanding how information relating to those matters could be properly deployed in the conduct of a defence.
Previous generations of Scots lawyers and judges do not appear to have
experienced the same insuperable difficulty as the appeal court.
It is, of course, trite that an individual charged with crime is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty.
But that is not to say that he has to be treated in all respects as if he were an innocent person against whom no charge had been brought.
Most obviously, in an appropriate case, he can be remanded in custody pending trial or granted bail subject to appropriate conditions.
Similarly, depending on the offence and the terms of his contract of employment, he may be suspended from his employment.
More generally, if you know that someone has been charged with, say, fraud, you will be less inclined to enter into a commercial transaction with him; if you know that someone has been charged with sexual abuse, you will think twice before entrusting your children to her care; if you know that someone has been charged with theft, you will be less inclined to trust anything which he tells you, unless it can be confirmed from other sources.
The Privy Councils decision in Holland, that the Crown should disclose outstanding charges of Crown witnesses of which they were aware, simply reflected the common sense position that just as in everyday life judges or jurors who have to assess the credibility of a witness may properly take into account not only the fact that the witness has been convicted of various offences, but also the fact that he has been charged with others.
To judge from the passage quoted in para 7 above, the appeal court seem to have thought that this was an unprincipled and incoherent innovation.
It is noteworthy that they did not refer to any authority.
In reality, the approach of the Privy Council, in so far as it proceeds on the basis that outstanding charges may have a bearing on a witnesss credibility, merely reflects what appears to have been recognised as the proper practice in Scottish courts for more than 170 years.
At one time, in Scots law anyone convicted of serious crimes became technically infamous (infamis) and was thereafter unable to give evidence at any trial.
By the early nineteenth century this rule was proving self defeating for the authorities: all too often it was a gift to the defence since it prevented the only material witnesses to crimes from giving evidence.
So the rule was first relaxed and then eventually abolished.
The only explicit authority relating to a witness with outstanding charges comes from that era.
At a High Court trial at Dumfries, when leading a Crown witness, William Higgins, the advocate depute began by establishing that he was due to be tried at the same circuit on a charge of theft by housebreaking, aggravated by his having been previously convicted of theft and being a thief by habit and repute.
See John Hannah and Hugh Higgins, 17 September 1836, Bells Notes, p 256, in the Supplement to Humes Commentaries on the Law of Scotland respecting Crimes (1844 edition), vol 2.
Since the court ruled on the admissibility of the advocate deputes line of questioning, the defence must have objected that the Crown were, in effect, leading a witness who, if convicted of the crime in question at his trial later in the sitting, would then be unable to testify.
The court rejected the argument and allowed the question.
As the author of the Notes, Sheriff Bell, comments, The court, however, in allowing the question, must have thought it relevant to affect the credit of the witness.
The potential relevance of outstanding charges to the credibility of a witness appears to have been settled in the nineteenth century.
See, for instance, Dicksons Treatise on the Law of Evidence in Scotland (revised edition, 1887) vol 2, para 1619.
Most significantly, Macdonalds Criminal Law of Scotland (3rd edition, 1894), p 462, says: Nor may [a witness] refuse to say whether he has been convicted of or stands indicted for a crime.
This passage appears in virtually the same words in the fifth and final edition (1948), pp 297 298.
The passage could never have stood unchallenged in successive editions of the traditional vademecum of Scottish criminal practitioners and judges if it had not reflected practice in the courts.
Not surprisingly, therefore, neither the advocate depute nor the Advocate General supported the approach of the appeal court in the present case.
In Holland v HM Advocate 2005 1 SC (PC) 3 the appellant was convicted of a charge of assault and robbery at a house in Rutherglen.
The Crown failed to disclose that there were outstanding charges against the complainers, relating to drug dealing at the house in question.
The Privy Council held, at p 25, para 75, that information about these charges would have helped to complete the picture both of the complainers and of their milieu.
In other words, it would have had the potential to weaken the Crown case and so it should have been disclosed.
In his written submissions in the present appeal, the advocate depute gave examples of other situations where an outstanding charge against a Crown witness might materially weaken the Crown case or strengthen the defence case: if the witness denied he had ever been in trouble with the police, an outstanding charge could legitimately be put to him; similarly an outstanding charge might provide a potential motive for the witness giving untrue information in an attempt to curry favour with the authorities.
It is unnecessary to prolong the discussion since the Crown did not deny that the outstanding charges against Mr Stronach might have weakened the Crown case by casting doubt on his character or credibility.
It follows that, in accordance with Holland v HM Advocate 2005 1 SC (PC) 3 and HM Advocate v Murtagh 2009 SLT 1060, the failure of the Crown to disclose the outstanding charges to the defence was indeed incompatible with the appellants article 6(1) Convention rights.
At the hearing of the appeal, all this really went without saying and the only live issue was the actual significance, in the whole circumstances of the case, of the Crowns failure to disclose the charges.
The appeal court did not consider that matter, but they did, of course, consider the effect of the Crowns failure to disclose his previous convictions.
Having considered the circumstances, the appeal court were not persuaded that the failure of the Crown to disclose the previous convictions of Stronach to the appellants advisers resulted in an unfair trial and hence a miscarriage of justice.
They accordingly rejected the appellants appeal, so far as based on the Crowns failure to disclose Mr Stronachs previous convictions.
Standing that decision, at the hearing before this Court, Mr Jackson QC, who appeared for the appellant, had to argue that the failure to disclose Mr Stronachs outstanding charges made a significant difference.
In other words, the Court should conclude that there would have been a real possibility of a different outcome if the jury had been made aware, not only of Mr Stronachs previous convictions, but of the outstanding charges against him: in that event, the jury might reasonably have come to a different view as to whether the appellant was concerned in the supplying of the various drugs during the relevant period.
The case against the appellant was circumstantial.
It comprised, for the most part, evidence of observations by police officers who had conducted a surveillance operation over several weeks.
The evidence relating to Mr Stronachs statement concerned events of 24 November 2003.
DS Duncan Smith was not otherwise involved in the relevant events.
He gave evidence that, at about 12.45 pm on 24 November, when checking an address, he saw a blue Peugeot, registration number M810 UEW, parked at the appellants home at 58 Whitelees Road, Cumbernauld.
At 9.32 pm Mr Stronach was seen driving the Peugeot to a service station at Kilmarnock where he met up with a Ford Orion.
The two cars drove in convoy to Logan, near Cumnock.
There, in the car park of the Logangate Arms, the driver of the Orion spoke to Mr Stronach who did not leave his car.
Mr Stronach then drove up to Glasgow and on to the M8 where he was stopped by two police officers.
A Farm Foods bag, found in the glove compartment of the Peugeot, contained cocaine worth at least 30,000.
The police interviewed Mr Stronach on tape in the early hours of 25 November.
This is the interview which is the subject of the additional ground of appeal.
The tape recording of the entire interview was played to the jury during the evidence of DC McFadden.
In the course of the interview Mr Stronach said that he had been sent by a man called Stevie from Abronhill to sell the car.
The appellants first name is Steven and his home was in the Abronhill district of Cumbernauld.
The description of Stevie given by Mr Stronach fitted the appellant.
On 27 November the appellant left his home and drove to the house of Mr Stronachs girlfriend in Denny.
He then took Mr Stronachs passport to Airdrie Sheriff Court where it was used in connexion with his application for bail.
A receipt for the passport from the court dated 27 November was recovered from the appellants home.
Defence counsel took DC McFadden through the transcript of the interview in detail and was able to show that Mr Stronach had told many lies.
When he came to address the jury, the advocate depute accepted that he had clearly lied about his movements and about his involvement in drugs.
But the advocate depute suggested to the jury that it would be easier to accept those parts of the interview which were supported by other acceptable evidence.
In particular, he pointed to the evidence of DS Smith, who was not otherwise involved in the investigation, that the Peugeot which Mr Stronach was driving when stopped by the police had been parked outside the appellants house earlier the same day.
The advocate depute also referred to the evidence about the appellant collecting Mr Stronachs passport from his girlfriends house and taking it to Airdrie Sheriff Court in connexion with his application for bail on the drugs charges arising out of the recovery of the cocaine from the Peugeot.
The advocate depute argued that it would be a spectacular coincidence if this did not indicate that the appellant knew of Mr Stronachs involvement with drugs.
summarised the position in this way: In his supplementary report to the appeal court, Lord Bracadale, Taking into account the analysis of the interview of Mr Stronach carried out by [defence counsel] and the concessions made as to his credibility by the advocate depute, the jury would have been most likely to conclude that Mr Stronach did indeed tell many lies in the course of the interview.
They would, however, have been entitled to be selective in their view of the evidence of Mr Stronach.
Lord Bracadale then referred to Mr Stronachs previous convictions and added: In the circumstances outlined above it is difficult to see how the canvassing of the previous convictions of Mr Stronach before the jury would have bolstered the already largely successful attack on his credibility.
It is also difficult to see why knowledge of the previous convictions would have discouraged the jury from being selective in the approach to the contents of the interview of Mr Stronach.
Against that background, the appeal court were not persuaded that the failure of the Crown to disclose Mr Stronachs previous convictions resulted in an unfair trial and hence a miscarriage of justice.
For exactly the same reasons, I am not persuaded that, if defence counsel had been able to deploy Mr Stronachs outstanding charges as well as his previous convictions, this would have made any material difference.
More especially, it would not have affected the fact that the jury, who must have been well aware of the defects in Mr Stronachs statements, could still, with equal plausibility, have accepted those elements, and only those elements, in Mr Stronachs account which were corroborated by other acceptable evidence.
I am accordingly satisfied that there is no real possibility that the jury would have come to a different verdict on the four charges against the appellant if they had been made aware, not only of Mr Stronachs previous convictions, but of the outstanding charges against him as well.
There has therefore been no miscarriage of justice.
I would accordingly dismiss Mr Allisons appeal and remit the case to the appeal court to proceed as accords.
LORD HOPE
make the same order as he proposes.
The point of principle which this case raises is whether a failure to disclose outstanding charges against a Crown witness is incompatible with the accuseds article 6(1) Convention rights.
Had it not been for the passage in the opinion of the appeal court which Lord Rodger has quoted in para 7 of his judgment, I would not have thought that there was now any room for dispute on the point.
In McDonald v HM Advocate [2008] UKPC 46. 2008 SLT 993, para 51 Lord Rodger said that the decisions of the Board in Holland v HM Advocate [2005] UKPC D 1, 2005 SC (PC) 3 and Sinclair v HM Advocate [2005] UKPC D 2, 2005 SC (PC) 28 had answered this question.
Included within the general description of disclosable material are two classes of material, namely police statements of any witnesses on the Crown list and the previous convictions and outstanding charges relating to those witnesses.
I agree with Lord Rodger that the appeal must be dismissed, and I would
The rule of law on which that classification is based is that of fairness.
In McLeod v HM Advocate (No 2) 1998 JC 67, Lord Justice General Rodger said that our system of criminal procedure proceeds on the basis that the Crown have a duty at any time to disclose to the defence information which would tend to exculpate the accused.
In Sinclair v HM Advocate, para 33 I said that the prosecution is under a duty to disclose to the defence all material evidence in its possession for or against the accused, and that for this purpose any evidence which would tend to undermine the prosecution case or to assist the case for the defence is to be taken as material.
Sometimes the proposition is worded differently.
In HM Advocate v McDonald [2008] UKPC 46, 2008 SLT 993, para 50 Lord Rodger said: Put shortly, the Crown must disclose any statement of other material of which it is aware and which either materially weakens the Crown case or materially strengthens the defence case (disclosable material) Lord Bingham of Cornhill used the same formula when describing the golden rule in R v H and others [2004] UKHL 3, [2004] 2 AC 134, para 14 when he said: Fairness ordinarily requires that any material held by the prosecution which weakens its case or strengthens that of the defendant, if not relied on as part of its formal case against the defendant, should be disclosed to the defence.
In HM Advocate v Murtagh [2009] UKPC 36, 2009 SLT 1060, para 11, I said, under reference to McLeod, Holland, Sinclair and McDonald, that it was well settled that the Crown must disclose any statements or other material of which it is aware which either materially weakens the Crown case or materially strengthens the case for the defence: see also Lord Rodger, para 48.
These formulations should however be regarded as expressing what has been described as the golden rule in shorthand.
After all, they are describing a decision about disclosure which must normally be taken before the trial.
It is a decision which will be based on an assumption as to what may happen in the future.
So the question the Crown must ask itself is what the possible effect would be likely to be if the material were to be disclosed.
As I said in R v Brown (Winston) [1998] AC 367, 374, it would be contrary to the principle of fairness for the prosecution to withhold from the defendant material which might undermine their case against him or which might assist his defence.
Lord Collins, referring to what I said in that case, also used the word might"" in Murtagh, para 75.
That is the way Lord Rodger has expressed the position that the Crown has adopted in this case in para 14, above, and I respectfully agree with it.
As for the point that troubled the appeal court, it is true that a distinction can be drawn between previous convictions and outstanding charges.
But that does not mean that it can be assumed that information about outstanding charges of Crown witnesses can never affect their credibility.
It is enough, for the disclosure rule to apply to them as a class, that they might do so.
Of course the person concerned is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty.
But if he is asked the question whether he has ever been in trouble with the police, he must answer it.
A false or evasive answer might well be thought by a jury to undermine his credibility.
Other circumstances may be envisaged where the fact that charges have been brought against the witness may have that effect.
The application of the rule to outstanding charges, as the Crown accepts, is really just based on common sense and every day experience.
No one should now be in any doubt that the disclosure rule applies to them, or as to the reasons why this is so.
LORD WALKER
that he gives I would dismiss this appeal.
I am in full agreement with the judgment of Lord Rodger.
For the reasons I agree with the judgment of Lord Rodger and, for the reasons that he gives, I agree with the judgment of Lord Rodger and, for the reasons that he gives,
LORD BROWN
I too would dismiss this appeal.
LORD KERR
I too would dismiss this appeal.
","On 9 September 2004 the appellant, Steve Allison, was convicted after trial in the High Court at Glasgow of four contraventions of section 4(3)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
In effect, he was found guilty of being concerned in the supplying of cocaine and three other controlled drugs.
The trial judge sentenced him to 8 years imprisonment.
The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence.
On 7 November 2008 the appeal court (Lord Osborne, Lady Paton and Lord Philip) refused his appeal against conviction, leaving his appeal against sentence to be heard on a date to be fixed.
One of his grounds of appeal, which was first advanced in an additional Note of Appeal, related to the record of a police interview of a John Stronach.
Mr Stronach had died before the trial and the Crown introduced the interview into evidence in accordance with the procedure in section 259(5) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.
Neither before nor during the trial did the Crown disclose to the defence that Mr Stronach had a number of previous convictions and that there were outstanding charges against him.
One of the outstanding cases was under the Misuse of Drugs Act and related to events covered by the trial and it was therefore known to the appellants legal advisers.
The Crown disclosed the previous convictions and the other outstanding charges only while the appellants appeal was pending before the appeal court.
This prompted the appellant to argue that the Crowns failure to disclose to the defence the existence of all the previous convictions and outstanding charges was incompatible with his article 6 Convention rights.
As a result, the defence had been unable to prepare and conduct their defence properly and appellant did not receive a fair trial.
When dismissing the appellants appeal, the appeal court accepted that the failure by the Crown to disclose Mr Stronachs previous convictions had been incompatible with the appellants article 6(1) rights.
Having considered the circumstances of the case, however, the appeal court was not persuaded that the Crowns failure had resulted in an unfair trial and hence a miscarriage of justice.
The appeal court drew a distinction between Mr Stronachs previous convictions and the outstanding charges against him.
Because of the presumption of innocence, the appeal court did not consider that the existence of outstanding charges could be of importance in connection with the preparation of a defence or with any challenge that might be mounted to the credibility of a witness.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, with Lord Rodger delivering the leading judgment of the Court.
The Court disagrees with the appeal courts view in relation to outstanding charges.
It is, of course, trite that an individual charged with crime is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.
But that is not to say that he has to be treated in all respects as if he were an innocent person against whom no charge has been brought (para 9).
The Privy Councils decision in Holland v HM Advocate 2005 1 SC (PC) 3, that the Crown should disclose outstanding charges of Crown witnesses of which they are aware, simply reflects the common sense position that just as in everyday life judges or jurors who have to assess the credibility of a witness may properly take into account not only the fact that the witness has been convicted of various offences, but also the fact that he has been charged with others.
This approach merely reflects what appears to have been recognised as the proper practice in Scottish courts for more than 170 years (para 10).
In the present case, the Crown does not deny that the outstanding charges against Mr Stronach might have weakened the Crown case by casting doubt on his character or credibility.
Indeed the Crown accepts that, in accordance with Holland and HM Advocate v Murtagh 2009 SLT 1060, the failure to disclose the outstanding charges to the defence was incompatible with the appellants article 6(1) rights (para 14).
The only live issue in the appeal, therefore, is the actual significance, in the whole circumstances of the case, of the Crowns failure to disclose the outstanding charges.
Having considered the circumstances of the case against the appellant, the Court is not persuaded that, if defence counsel had been able to deploy Mr Stronachs outstanding charges as well as his previous convictions, this would have made any material difference (para 22).
The Court is satisfied that there is no real possibility that the jury would have come to a different verdict on the charges against the appellant if they had been made aware, not only of Mr Stonachs previous convictions, but of the outstanding charges against him as well.
There has therefore been no miscarriage of justice (para 23).
"
uksc-2017-0040,"In circumstances in which at the time of a divorce a spouse, say a wife, is awarded capital which enables her to purchase a home but later she exhausts the capital by entry into a series of unwise transactions and so develops a need to pay rent, is the court entitled to decline to increase the order for the husband to make periodical payments to her so as to fund payment of all (or perhaps even any) of her rent even if he could afford to do so?
Mr Mills (whom it will be convenient to describe as the husband notwithstanding his divorce from Mrs Mills, the wife, in 2002) appeals against an order for upwards variation of an order for periodical payments against him in favour of the wife.
The order for variation was made by the Court of Appeal (Longmore LJ and Sir Ernest Ryder, Senior President of Tribunals) on 1 February 2017: [2017] EWCA Civ 129.
By that order, the Court of Appeal allowed the wifes appeal against the dismissal of her application to vary the order for periodical payments by Judge Everall QC (the judge) in the Central Family Court in London on 9 June 2015.
The husband and wife are each aged 52.
They were married in 1987.
The wife is a qualified beauty therapist.
In the early years of the marriage she worked, self employed, in that capacity.
The husband built up a surveying business within two companies which he and the wife owned in equal shares.
They had one child, a son, now adult.
In 1996 the wife unfortunately suffered a late miscarriage, which precipitated a long period of painful gynaecological difficulties for her.
In 2000 the husband left the home in Guildford.
On 7 June 2002, in the ensuing divorce proceedings, financial issues were resolved within a consent order.
In addition to provision for their son, who was to continue to make his home with the wife and have contact with the husband, the order provided that: i) the home, vested in the joint names of the parties, should be sold; ii) its net proceeds should be divided in accordance with a formula which in the event yielded 230,000 for the wife in settlement of all her capital claims against the husband and 23,000 for him; the wife should transfer to the husband her interest in policies worth iii) 23,000 and her shares in the surveying companies; and iv) the husband should make periodical payments to her at the annual rate of 13,200 (not index linked) on the open ended basis, namely during their joint lives until her remarriage or further order in the interim.
The wife therefore received the vast preponderance of the parties liquid capital.
The value of the two companies was not identified.
At the time of making the consent order the wife had represented that ill health was disabling her from working and that she would need 350,000 with which to purchase a suitable home for herself and their son.
The husband had conceded that she then had no capacity to raise a mortgage but had suggested, by contrast, that she could purchase a suitable home for 230,000 or less, in other words free of mortgage.
In the event, later in 2002, she proceeded to purchase a house in Weybridge for 345,000 by deploying in effect her entire share of the proceeds of the home and by raising the balance of 125,000 on mortgage.
When he learnt of the wifes purchase, the husband, by solicitors, expressed surprise at its high cost and concern about her ability to service a mortgage, let alone one of such size.
By solicitors, she replied only that she had not been able to secure reasonably priced accommodation in an area in which it would in her opinion be best for their son to grow up.
wife had begun to work again as a beauty therapist, but part time.
In 2006 the wife sold the house in Weybridge at the price for which she had bought it, namely 345,000.
But the sum owing on mortgage had risen by 93,000 to 218,000.
Having received written and oral evidence from the wife, the judge found that she had been unable satisfactorily to explain why the sum owing had increased or in what way the increase had been spent.
Upon the sale of the house in Weybridge the wife bought a flat in Wimbledon for 323,000, with a deposit of 48,000 and a mortgage of 275,000.
The judge therefore calculated that, net of collateral costs of the transactions, about 62,000 of the proceeds of sale had not been used in the purchase of the flat; but he noted that the wife had refurbished it to some extent.
It is clear that, by the time of her purchase of the house in Weybridge, the
In 2007 the wife sold the flat in Wimbledon for 435,000.
The sum then owing on mortgage had risen only marginally, namely to 277,000.
Instead she bought a flat in Battersea for 520,000, with a deposit of 78,000 and a mortgage of 442,000.
The judge therefore calculated that, net of the collateral costs, about 44,000 of the proceeds of sale had not been used in the purchase of the second flat.
It is unclear from his judgment how the wife was able to secure, and then to service, a borrowing as high as 442,000.
In 2009 the wife sold the flat in Battersea for 580,000 and began to rent accommodation.
The judge calculated that, after repaying the mortgage of 442,000 and meeting the collateral costs, the wife received about 120,000 from the proceeds of sale.
Between 2009 and 2015 the wife rented six successive properties in London and Surrey.
By April 2015, when the judge heard the case, the wife had no capital.
On the contrary, she had overdrafts of 4,000, credit card liabilities of 18,000 and a tax liability of about 20,000.
Before the judge were cross applications.
The husband had applied for discharge of the order for periodical payments on his payment to the wife of a modest capital sum, say of 26,000; or for a fixed period to be set on her continued receipt of periodical payments and/or for a downwards variation of their amount.
The wife had cross applied for an upwards variation of their amount.
Both applications were made under section 31(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (the Act).
Section 31(7) provides: In exercising the powers conferred by this section the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, [which] shall include any change in any of the matters to which the court was required to have regard when making the order to which the application relates, and (a) in the case of a periodical payments . order made on or after the grant of a decree of divorce . , the court shall consider whether in all the circumstances and after having regard to any such change it would be appropriate to vary the order so that payments under the order are required to be made only for such further period as will in the opinion of the court be sufficient to enable the party in whose favour the order was made to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of those payments; The matters to which the court was required to have regard when making the order in 2002, even though it was made by consent, were those set out in section 25(2) of the Act.
In his judgment, which was reserved, the judge described the wifes oral evidence as not fully satisfactory.
He explained that she had been unable to give him a clear picture of her financial circumstances in the years since 2002; that, apart from her failure to explain the dramatic increase in the size of the mortgage on the house in Weybridge, she had been unable to identify the size of her income from her part time work in the earlier years, first as a beauty therapist and then for an estate agent.
He accepted that between 2004 and 2010 she had undergone no less than seven surgical procedures referable to her gynaecological difficulties and that they had affected her earning capacity at that time.
He found, however, that she had exaggerated the continuing impact, five years later, of those difficulties upon her earning capacity.
In 2010 she had reverted to work as a beauty therapist.
Her accounts for the last available year, namely to April 2014, disclosed an annual income net of tax of about 18,500.
She had then been working about three days each week.
The judge rejected her contention that ill health precluded her from working for a fourth day but accepted that she might not be able to attract the extra clients to occupy it.
He therefore ascribed to her annual net earnings of only 18,500.
The husband contends that it was a somewhat conservative figure; but it is appropriate for an appellate court to adopt it without qualification.
The judge found that the husband, by contrast, gave reliable and truthful evidence in all respects.
He had remarried and was living with his second wife, their nine year old son and an adult step daughter in a house in Guildford in which, subject to a substantial mortgage, he had a half interest.
As in 2002 he had little liquid capital.
The judge studied his earned income from the surveying companies.
They had suffered a reverse in 2012 but had slowly recovered since then and, as the husband frankly conceded at the hearing, they were likely to be thriving by 2025.
The judge ascribed to the husband an existing net annual income of 55,000 inclusive of a small salary which one of the companies chose to pay to his current wife.
It may again have been a somewhat conservative figure; but it is again appropriate for an appellate court to adopt it without qualification.
At the hearing the wifes then counsel put before the judge a breakdown of what he suggested to be the amount of her necessary annual expenditure.
The judge accepted it as very modest.
Exclusive of figures referable to the adult son, the annual total was 35,792, of which 10,200 was for rent.
Following deduction of her earnings of 18,500, the wifes annual need was therefore for 17,292.
But the judges decision was not to vary, whether upwards or downwards, the existing order for periodical payments in the annual sum of 13,200.
In other words he countenanced a shortfall of 4,092 between the wifes annual need and the husbands obligation to meet it.
The answer lies in the judges analysis of the wifes loss of the capital sum which had been awarded to her in 2002.
The judge found that: the award in 2002 would then have enabled the wife to buy a home it had however been reasonable for her to be ambitious and to secure i) free of mortgage; ii) a mortgage for the purchase of the house in Weybridge; iii) thereafter she had not managed her finances wisely; iv) like others at that time, she had committed herself to borrowings which were too high; v) or wanton; vi) but her needs had been augmented by reason of the choices which she had made.
In the light of those findings the judge decided to reject the husbands submission that the wifes need to pay rent of 10,200 should be entirely eliminated from the total annual need which it would be appropriate for him to meet.
Nevertheless it was it would be wrong to describe her approach to finances as profligate fair that the husbands contribution to the wifes needs should not include a full contribution to her housing costs.
If, however arbitrarily, one omits to ascribe any part of the wifes earnings to the payment of rent of 10,200 and treats the rent as entirely subsumed within her residual annual need of 17,292, it is easy to see that the effect of the judges decision to countenance a shortfall from that figure of 4,092 was to oblige the husband to pay 6,108 towards the rent, or 60% of it.
Although the judge had described the wifes schedule of annual needs totalling 35,792 as very modest and indeed as basic, he said that the husbands contribution should do no more than to enable her to meet her bare minimum needs, which, so he therefore implied, were properly to be reflected in an even lower figure.
The wife, he said, will have to adjust her expenditure to live within her means.
The judge found on clear evidence that the husband could afford to continue to make periodical payments in the annual sum of 13,200.
Indeed, although there was no cause for him to make a finding to this effect, it also seems reasonably clear that the husband could have afforded to pay the extra annual sum of 4,092 if it had been otherwise appropriate to order him to do so; it was certainly no part of the judges reasoning that the husband could not have afforded to pay it.
In accordance with his duty the judge then turned to consider the husbands application for him to set a fixed period upon the wifes continued receipt of the periodical payments.
But, applying section 31(7)(a) set out in para 14 above, the judge concluded, unsurprisingly, that he could not identify any fixed period as being sufficient to enable the wife to adjust without undue hardship to their termination.
It followed that the order should continue to require them to be paid on the open ended basis, namely during their joint lives until her remarriage or further order in the interim.
Although the open ended basis does not specify a fixed term for the life of the order, the circumstances which it identifies as bringing it to an end, in particular the potential for a further order ending it at any time, show how misleading (indeed, as the husband himself says, how unattractive) it is for some non lawyers to describe such an order as a meal ticket for life.
Inevitably the judge also concluded that any appropriate capitalisation of periodical payments in that continuing sum and on that continuing basis appeared to be beyond the husbands means.
So the judge dismissed both the husbands application and the wifes cross application.
Both the husband and the wife sought permission from the Court of Appeal to appeal against the respective dismissals of their applications.
The wife secured permission to do so but, in circumstances which rendered him aggrieved but are no longer relevant, the husbands application for permission was not granted likewise but was listed to be heard by the court at the time when it was to hear the wifes substantive appeal.
At the conclusion of the hearing on 1 February 2017 Sir Ernest Ryder gave an impromptu judgment, with which Longmore LJ agreed.
In his judgment Sir Ernest said that i) the judge did not give any reason why any part of the trimmed budget, that is the wifes basic needs budget, should be cut in explanation of why that shortfall should not be met; ii) budget that he, the judge, had accepted in evidence; and iii) his decision that she would have to adjust her expenditure to reduce those needs was a conclusion [which] required reasoning that is not in the judgment.
he did not explain why she should live below the basic needs
So the Court of Appeal allowed the wifes appeal by varying the order for periodical payments upwards from the annual sum of 13,200 to that of 17,292, backdated to the date of the judges judgment.
It refused the husbands application for permission to appeal to it on the ground that his proposed appeal had no prospect of success.
The husband filed a notice of appeal to this court.
He challenged the increase in the order for periodical payments directed by the Court of Appeal.
But he also purported to challenge its refusal to discharge the order for periodical payments; and, alternatively, its refusal to set a fixed period on the wifes continued receipt of them and/or to vary the amount of them downwards.
In these respects he was, however, purporting to challenge the Court of Appeals refusal to permit him to appeal to itself on these grounds and, by section 54(4) of the Access to Justice Act 1999, no appeal can be brought against a refusal of permission.
So the order of this court was to limit its permission for him to appeal to the single ground whether, in light of the fact that provision had already been made for the wifes housing needs in the capital settlement, the Court of Appeal had been entitled to interfere with the judges determination not to make full allowance for her need to pay rent in the continuing order for periodical payments.
Unfortunately the husbands advisers considered that the terms of the limited grant of permission could in some way prove broad enough to enable them to make submissions at the hearing along the wider lines of his impermissible challenge to the Court of Appeals refusal to grant him permission to appeal to it.
So at an early stage of the hearing the court had to re emphasise the limited ambit of its inquiry in this particular case.
With the greatest of respect to the Court of Appeal, and with (I believe) a full appreciation of the heavy work load under which it currently labours, it erred in saying that the judge had given no reason for declining to increase the order for periodical payments so as to enable the wife to meet all her basic needs.
The judge gave a clear reason which is summarised in paras 20 and 21 above.
So the question which the Court of Appeal should have addressed, and which this court should now address, is the question set out in para 1 above.
the Court of Appeal.
First, Pearce v Pearce [2003] EWCA Civ 1054, [2004] 1 WLR 68.
At the time of the original order in 1997 the wife had owned a flat in Chelsea free of mortgage.
Later she sold the flat; depleted the proceeds by an unfortunate speculation in Ireland; and, upon returning to live in London, could only afford to buy a flat in Fulham subject to mortgage.
The original order had also provided for the husband to make periodical payments to the wife; and the subsequent order under appeal in 2003 was to capitalise her entitlement to periodical payments, ie to discharge the order for them upon payment to her by the husband of a lump sum in lieu of them pursuant to section 31(7A) and (7B) of the Act.
The major significance of the decision of the Court of Appeal lies in its approach to the exercise of capitalising an order for periodical payments.
For present purposes, however, its significance lies in its removal of the wifes mortgage repayments from its calculation of the amount of the periodical payments to which, in the absence of capitalisation, she would then have been entitled and therefore of the amount of the lump sum to be paid by the husband in lieu of them.
Thorpe LJ said at para 36 that the judge In addressing the question, the court must consider three earlier decisions of should not have allowed the wife to discharge her mortgage at the husbands expense.
Such an indemnity violates the principle that capital claims compromised in 1997 could not be revisited in 2003.
There is simply no power or discretion to embark on further adjustment of capital to reflect the outcome of unwise or unfortunate investment on one side or prudent or lucky investment on the other.
Second, North v North [2007] EWCA Civ 760, [2007] All ER (D) 386 (Jul).
In 1981 an order by consent had provided the wife with ownership of a mortgage free house in Sheffield and of ground rents which generated a comfortable income for her.
The order had also included provision for the husband to make periodical payments to her in a nominal sum.
In 2000 the wife sold her assets in England and moved to Sydney with relatively disastrous financial consequences, which led her to apply for an upwards variation of the order for periodical payments.
The Court of Appeal set aside an order capitalising her entitlement to them in the sum of 202,000 and, although not visible in the transcript or in the report, apparently substituted a substantially lower figure.
Thorpe LJ said: 32.
In any application under section 31 the Applicants needs are likely to be the dominant or magnetic factor.
But it does not follow that the respondent is inevitably responsible financially for any established needs.
He is not an insurer against all hazards nor, when fairness is the measure, is he necessarily liable for needs created by the applicants financial mismanagement, extravagance or irresponsibility 33.
Thus in the present case the wifes failure to utilise her earning potential, her subsequent abandonment of the secure financial future provided for her by the husband, her choice of a more hazardous future in Australia, together with her lifestyle choices in Australia, were all productive of needs which she had generated and for which the husband should not as a matter of fairness be held responsible in law.
And third, Yates v Yates [2012] EWCA Civ 532, [2013] 2 FLR 1070.
Under a consent order the wife had received a substantial lump sum on the basis that she would use half of it in discharging a mortgage on her home.
In the event she had repaid only part of the mortgage debt and had invested in a non income bearing bond the sum which she had thus elected not to apply to full clearance of the mortgage.
When, later, a judge came to capitalise her right to continuing periodical payments, he included in his calculation of her need the amount of interest payable by her in respect of the residual mortgage debt.
The Court of Appeal held that the inclusion had been wrong.
Thorpe LJ said: Lewison LJ said: 12.
It seems to me little more than common sense that if a recipient of a lump sum twice the size of the mortgage on the final matrimonial home elects to hold back capital made available for the mortgage discharge in order to invest in a bond that bears no income, she cannot look to the payer thereafter for indemnity or contribution to the continuing mortgage interest payments.
That seems to me to be an absolutely self evident point. 21. the need to pay the mortgage at all arose from her own choice not to apply the lump sum in discharging the existing mortgage The financial consequences of her investment choice are her responsibility.
It is wrong in principle for the husband to have to continue to fund the mortgage.
Mr Feehan QC, who, like Ms Dunseath, nobly appears for the wife without fee, seeks to distinguish the mortgage instalments disallowed in the cases of Pearce and Yates from payments of rent.
I see no relevant distinction.
He also submits that, unlike the present case, all three of the decisions concerned the capitalisation of an entitlement to periodical payments and that what was there rightly disallowed was the insinuation into the lump sum thus payable of a sum more reflective of an impermissible second claim for capital provision than of a permissible claim for conversion into capital of an income entitlement.
Mr Feehan relies in particular on the statement of Thorpe LJ in the Pearce case, quoted at para 36 above.
I reject the submission.
As the Court of Appeal valuably established in that case, the first step in the exercise of capitalisation is a calculation of the amount of periodical payments to which, in the absence of capitalisation, the payee would then have been entitled.
It was in the course of making this calculation that in the three decisions the objectionable elements of the claim were disallowed.
Even had there been no capitalisation of the entitlement to periodical payments, those elements would therefore have been disallowed in quantifying the amount of the ongoing order for periodical payments.
The cases of Pearce, North and Yates were correctly decided.
The answer to the question posed in para 1 above is yes.
By its terms that question asks only whether a court would be entitled, rather than obliged, in the circumstances there identified to decline to require the husband to fund payment of the rent.
Its reference to the courts entitlement to do so serves to respect the wide discretion conferred upon it by section 31(1) and (7) of the Act in determining an application for variation of an order for periodical payments.
But, in the passages quoted above, the Court of Appeal has expressed itself in forceful terms; and a court would need to give very good reasons for requiring a spouse to fund payment of the other spouses rent in the circumstances identified by the question.
A spouse may well have an obligation to make provision for the other; but an obligation to duplicate it in such circumstances is most improbable.
The judge was clearly entitled to decline to vary the order for periodical payments so as to require the husband to pay all of the wifes rent.
The order of the Court of Appeal should be set aside and his order restored.
","The Appellant and Respondent are former husband and wife.
They divorced in 2002 after a marriage of approximately fifteen years, and the financial issues in the divorce were resolved by way of a consent order.
Under the terms of that order the wife received 230,000 in settlement of her capital claims against the husband, and it was also agreed that the husband would make periodical payments to her at an annual rate of 13,200.
It was reasonably anticipated by the husband that the wife would use the 230,000 to purchase a suitable home for herself and their son without a mortgage, as the wife had been suffering from ill health which made it difficult for her to work.
In the event, however, the wife did manage to take out a mortgage, and she duly purchased a more expensive home for 345,000.
Between 2002 and 2009 the wife sold and purchased a series of different properties, and with each purchase the amount which she borrowed increased.
In addition, she did not necessarily reinvest all of the sale proceeds from one property into the next and seemingly spent the balance, with the result that the amount of capital she had decreased over time.
Eventually, in 2009 the wife sold her final property and began to rent accommodation.
By April 2015, when the first instance judge heard the case, the wife had no capital, and she had debts of around 42,000.
The hearing before the judge was to determine two cross applications made under s.31(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
The husband had applied for the discharge or downwards variation of the order for periodical payments, whereas the wife had applied for the order for periodical payments to be varied upwards.
In determining the applications the judge noted that there was a shortfall of 4,092 per annum between the wifes current needs and, when coupled with her own earnings, the existing level of the periodical payments.
However, he also held that, although the wifes actions had not been profligate, she had not managed her finances wisely and her current financial needs, in particular her need to pay rent, had been increased by the choices which she had made.
Consequently, the judge considered that it would be unfair to the husband if he had to make a full contribution to the wifes rental costs.
The judge therefore declined to vary the order for periodical payments either upwards or downwards.
This meant that the husband would continue to contribute to around 60% of the wifes rental costs, and the wife would have to adjust her expenditure to accommodate the shortfall.
The wife appealed against this decision to the Court of Appeal, and was successful.
The Court of Appeal considered that the judge had not given sufficient reasons why all of the wifes basic needs should not be met by the periodical payments from the husband, and increased the level of periodical payments to cover her shortfall, i.e. to 17,292.
The husband now appeals against this decision to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal, concluding that the judge was entitled to decline to vary the order for periodical payments so as to require the husband to pay all of the wifes rental costs.
Lord Wilson gives the judgment with which Lady Hale, Lord Carnwath, Lord Hughes and Lord Hodge agree.
The husband was granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court only on a single ground whether, in light of the fact that provision had already been made for the wifes housing needs in the capital settlement, the Court of Appeal was entitled to interfere with the judges decision not to increase the periodical payments so as to cover all of the wifes current rental costs [32].
The Court of Appeal had erred in saying that the judge had given no reason for declining to increase the order for periodical payments the judge had given a clear reason, namely that the wifes unwise decisions in relation to her capital had increased her basic needs by requiring her to pay rent, and that it was consequently unfair to expect the husband to meet these increased needs in full [33].
The Court of Appeal should have considered the impact of the original capital payment on the wifes current need to pay rent, and this involved a consideration of three earlier Court of Appeal authorities: Pearce v Pearce [2003] EWCA Civ 1054, North v North [2007] EWCA Civ 760, and Yates v Yates [2012] EWCA Civ 532 [34 38].
These cases were correctly decided and in light of this the judge was entitled, although not obliged, to decline to require the husband to fund payment of the rent in full.
This respects the wide discretion conferred upon the court under section 31(1) and (7) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in determining an application for variation of an order for periodical payments.
Moreover, a court would need to give very good reasons for requiring a spouse to fund payment of the other spouses rent in the circumstances of this case.
A spouse may well be obliged to make provision for the other spouse, but an obligation to duplicate that provision in situations such as this is improbable [40].
"
uksc-2017-0031,"The issue in this case is the proper approach of the immigration appellate authorities where the Secretary of State has decided that a national of the European Economic Area who is lawfully living in the United Kingdom should be removed on the ground of abuse of the right to reside here.
The abuse in question happened to be an alleged attempt to enter into a marriage of convenience but the issue would arise in respect of any abuse which would justify removal under article 35 of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (the Directive).
The facts
Ms Sadovska is a citizen of Lithuania.
She came to this country lawfully in February 2007 and has since been living and working here lawfully, exercising her rights under the Directive.
She lives in Edinburgh, where her sisters also live, and works as a cleaner.
Mr Malik is a citizen of Pakistan who came to this country lawfully with a Tier 4 student visa in May 2011.
His visa expired on 15 April 2013 and he has been here unlawfully ever since.
He too lives and worked in Edinburgh until 17 April 2014.
They say that they met at a disco, El Barrio in Edinburgh, in October 2012.
They spent that night together and saw one another from time to time afterwards, meeting members of one anothers families, but the relationship did not become a steady one until Valentines Day 2013.
Thereafter, they say, they saw one another as boyfriend and girlfriend.
It is common ground (and there is photographic evidence) that in December 2013, Mr Malik attended the wedding of Ms Sadovskas sister and that they were on the streets of Edinburgh together during the celebrations at Hogmanay 2013.
It is also common ground that Mr Malik booked a double room for two adults at a London hotel for four nights in January 2014 and that they were both in London at that time.
They say that they were on holiday together and that was when they decided to get married.
On 25 March 2014, they published notice of their intention to marry on 17 April 2014 at Leith Registry Office.
On 28 March 2014, they signed a one page statement about their relationship which included the following puzzling sentence: We have discussed the idea of living together in depth and also have touched upon the subject of marriage, but as of yet, none of these discussions have manifested into action.
That statement was enclosed in a letter dated 11 April 2014, sent by solicitors acting for Mr Malik (and, it would appear, also for Ms Sadovska) to the Home Office in Glasgow.
This explained that their client was an over stayer, but that he intended to marry an EEA national on 17 April 2014 and would be applying for recognition that he was exercising Treaty rights as a family member of an EEA national, so it was hoped that no enforcement action would be taken against him.
The letter recognised that officials might wish to interview their clients but hoped that this could be done before their wedding on 17 April.
It also stated that: We would like you to take this letter as a human rights allegation that both the applicant and the EEA national have established a family life in the United Kingdom and any decision to attempt to remove the applicant from the United Kingdom would be challenged on article 8 grounds and also on the grounds that the applicant [sci: attempt?] breaches our clients right to marry under article 12 of the ECHR.
Enclosed were copies of Mr Maliks passport, of Ms Sadovskas identity card, birth certificate and most recent payslip, a receipt from the Property Management Company in respect of a flat in Edinburgh for which they had signed a lease on 6 April 2014, three statements from two people who knew them, and their statement of 28 March.
Mr Malik and Ms Sadovska had indeed signed a lease for a flat in Edinburgh on 6 April 2014 and each gave this as their home address when interviewed on 17 April. (We are told that they still live together but at a different address.) On 16 April 2016 they bought wedding rings.
The solicitors letter was faxed to the Home Office on Friday 11 April.
The wedding was due to take place on the afternoon of the following Thursday.
Before that could happen, however, immigration officers arrived at the Registrars Office and asked to interview them.
They agreed.
Each was cautioned and agreed to be interviewed in English.
They were interviewed separately, Mr Malik from 14.55 to 16.20 and Ms Sadovska from 14.54 to 16.50, according to the immigration officers records.
After the interviews they were detained and thus unable to marry.
Ms Sadovska was released soon afterwards, but Mr Malik was detained until 11 June.
On the same day as the interviews, each was issued with a two part decision notice.
Mr Malik was issued with a notice that he was a person liable to removal as an over stayer, who had not applied for further leave to remain after his visa had expired and was thus liable to be detained pending a decision whether or not to give directions for his removal from the United Kingdom.
The notice explained that he had breached section 10(1)(a) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which provides that a person who is not a British citizen may be removed from the United Kingdom, in accordance with directions given by an immigration officer, if (a) having only a limited leave to enter or remain, he . remains beyond the time limited by the leave, and had therefore committed an offence under section 24(1)(b)(i) of the Immigration Act 1971.
Ms Sadovska was issued with a notice that she was a person liable to removal because her removal was justified on grounds of abuse of rights, specifically that she had attempted to enter into a marriage of convenience with Mr Malik.
The notice referred to regulation 19(3)(c), without explaining that this was contained in the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.
At the time, this provided that an EEA national who has entered the United Kingdom . may be removed if (c) the Secretary of State has decided that the persons removal is justified on grounds of abuse of rights in accordance with regulation 21B(2).
Regulation 21B(1) provided that The abuse of a right to reside includes (c) entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person to enter or attempt to enter, a marriage or civil partnership of convenience.
Regulation 21B(2) provided that The Secretary of State may take an EEA decision on the grounds of abuse of rights where there are reasonable grounds to suspect the abuse of a right to reside and it is proportionate to do so.
Regulation 24(2) provided that where a decision to remove was taken under regulation 19(3)(c), the person was to be treated as someone to whom section 10(1)(a) of the 1999 Act applied.
In each case, the notice was accompanied with notice of a decision to remove.
Both appealed to the First tier Tribunal which heard their appeals together on 4 August 2014 and promulgated a determination refusing them both on 19 August 2014.
Their appeals to the Upper Tribunal were heard on 5 February 2015 and a determination refusing them was promulgated on 9 February 2015.
Their appeals to the First Division of the Inner House of the Court of Session were refused on 17 June 2016: [2016] CSIH 51.
They now appeal to this court.
They make two complaints about the decisions of the tribunals and court below.
The first, and most important, relates to the burden of proof in a case such as this.
Under the heading Applicable law, the First tier Tribunal judge said this, at para 7: In immigration appeals, the burden of proof is on the appellant and the standard of proof required is a balance of probabilities.
In human rights appeals, it is for the appellant to show that there has been an interference with his or her human rights.
If that is established, and the relevant article permits, it is then for the respondent to establish that the interference was justified.
The appropriate standard of proof is whether there are substantial grounds for believing the evidence.
It is apparent from his determination that his whole approach was to require Ms Sadovska and Mr Malik to prove that their proposed marriage was not a marriage of convenience, rather than to require the Home Office to prove that it was.
Before the Upper Tribunal the appellants complaint was that the First tier Tribunal judge had taken the interviews as his starting point and given too much weight to the inconsistencies between them and had not considered them in the context of the totality of the evidence, as required by the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Papajorgji v Entry Clearance Officer, Nicosia [2012] UKUT 38, [2012] Imm AR 3 (at para 39).
Papajorgji was an extraordinary case in which an Albanian woman who had been married to and living with a Greek man for 12 years and had two children with him was refused a visa to accompany him on a visit to this country on the ground that theirs was a marriage of convenience, a belief which, as the Upper Tribunal said, was on the information supplied with the application simply ludicrous (para 32).
There was no burden on the claimant in an application for a family permit to establish that she was not party to a marriage of convenience unless the circumstances known to the decision maker gave reasonable ground for suspecting that that was the case.
Where there was such a suspicion the matter required further investigation and the claimant should be invited to respond to by producing evidential material to dispel it (para 27).
But suspicion was not enough.
The claimant was only disqualified if it was established that the marriage was one of convenience (para 37).
The question for the judge was in the light of the totality of the information before me, including the assessment of the claimants answers and any information provided, am I satisfied that it is more probable than not this is a marriage of convenience? (para 39)
Before the First Division, the appellants did complain that the tribunal had adopted the wrong approach to the burden of proof and that the respondent had failed to prove to the requisite high degree that the appellants were guilty of fraud.
The court dealt with the matter in this way, at para 20: However, as has often been said, once the evidence has been heard, questions of onus usually cease to be important (Sanderson v McManus 1997 SC (HL) 55, Lord Hope at 62).
The view of the UT in Papajorgji (at para 39) that the question, in the Tribunal context, was whether it is more probable than not that the marriage is one of convenience in [the] light of the totality of the information, accords with that dictum.
The court went on to say that the First tier Tribunal had considered all the information and reached a decision based upon it.
That decision did not depend upon onus but upon weighing the various factors in the balance.
In that context, there was only one standard of proof, that being the balance of probabilities (Scottish Ministers v Stirton 2014 SC 218, the Lord Justice Clerk (Lord Carloway) at paras 117 119).
It is perhaps worth noting that Lord Hopes observation in Sanderson v McManus, that questions of onus usually cease to be important once the evidence is before the court was in the context of a dispute between unmarried parents about a fathers contact with his child, when, as Lord Hope observed the matter then becomes one of overall impression, balancing one consideration against another and having regard always to the consideration which has been stated to be paramount (that is, the welfare of the child).
Even then, the court had to be able to come to the conclusion that making an order would be in the childs best interests.
This demonstrates that, when considering the burden of proof, it is necessary to understand what the issues are and what has to be established.
The appellants also complain that their interviews were unfair, oppressive and repugnant to public law standards.
The circumstances of being approached on their wedding day by uniformed immigration officers carrying batons and handcuffs meant that they were frightened.
They agreed to be interviewed in English but neither is fluent in English.
They had no time to contact their solicitor for advice, to obtain an interpreter, to produce evidence and contact witnesses.
They complain that both the First tier and the Upper Tribunal had thought the interviews were of central importance, yet they gave no weight to the circumstances in which they had taken place.
The law
It is of central importance in this case to consider the substantive law governing the respondents decisions and what had therefore to be established in each case.
It differs significantly as between the two appellants.
Ms Sadovska is an EEA national.
Her rights are therefore governed by the Directive, which the 2006 Regulations were designed to implement in UK law.
To the extent, if any, that the 2006 Regulations do not accurately transpose the requirements of the Directive, we have to give effect to the Directive rather than the Regulations and so it is appropriate to focus on the provisions of the Directive.
She has been living lawfully in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of more than five years.
This means that, under article 16 of the Directive, she has the right of permanent residence here.
None of the conditions attached to the right of residence of people who have been here for more than three months but less than five years, provided for in article 8 of the Directive, applies.
Article 28.2 lays down the general rule that a host member state may not take an expulsion decision against a Union citizen who has the right of permanent residence except on serious grounds of public policy or public security.
However, Recital 28 to the Directive states that: To guard against abuse of rights or fraud, notably marriages of convenience or any other form of relationships contracted for the sole purpose of enjoying the right of free movement and residence, member states should have the possibility to adopt the necessary measures.
This is therefore provided for in article 35, which is the crucial article in this case: Member states may adopt the necessary measures to refuse, terminate or withdraw any right conferred by this Directive in the case of abuse of rights or fraud, such as marriages of convenience.
Any such measure shall be proportionate and subject to the procedural safeguards provided for in articles 30 and 31.
Article 30 requires that the person concerned be notified in writing of the decision and informed precisely and in full of the reason for it and where and within what time that person may lodge an appeal.
Article 31 requires that the person have access to judicial and, where appropriate, administrative redress procedures to appeal against or seek review of any decision taken against them.
These shall allow for an examination of the legality of the decision, as well as of the facts and circumstances on which [it] is based.
They shall ensure that the decision is not
disproportionate
A Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on guidance for the better transposition and application of Directive 2004/38/EC, dated 2 July 2009, has this to say about marriages of convenience, at para 4.2: Recital 28 defines marriages of convenience for the purposes of the Directive as marriages contracted for the sole purpose of enjoying the right of free movement and residence under the Directive that someone would not have otherwise.
A marriage cannot be considered as a marriage of convenience simply because it brings an immigration advantage, or indeed any other advantage.
The quality of the relationship is immaterial to the application of Article 35.
The definition in the first sentence is repeated in the Commissions more recent Handbook on addressing the issues of alleged marriages of convenience between EU citizens and non EU nationals in the context of EU law on free movement of EU citizens, dated 26 September 2014.
However, this goes on to explain that: the notion of sole purpose should not be interpreted literally (as being the unique or exclusive purpose) but rather as meaning that the objective to obtain the right of entry and residence must be the predominant purpose of the abusive conduct.
But it repeats that: On the other hand, a marriage cannot be considered as a marriage of convenience simply because it brings an immigration advantage, or indeed any other advantage (for example the right to a particular surname, location related allowances, tax advantages or entitlement to social housing for married couples).
Mr Malik is in a different position from Ms Sadovska.
As an over stayer he is, as noted above, liable to be removed under section 10(1)(a) of the 1999 Act.
However, had he succeeded in marrying Ms Sadovska, he would have become a family member within the meaning of article 2.2 of the Directive.
Under article 7.2, this would bring with it the right of residence for more than three months, provided that Ms Sadovska satisfied one of the conditions in article 7.1(a), (b) or (c).
As a worker she would satisfy condition (a).
Once he had been living here lawfully for five years, he too would acquire a right of permanent residence under article 16.2.
As with Ms Sadovska, of course, he would be liable to removal under article 35 if their marriage was one of convenience.
As they have not succeeded in marrying, Mr Malik is not a family member of an EU citizen.
However, article 3.2 requires Member States to facilitate the entry and residence of certain other persons, who include (b) the partner with whom the Union citizen has a durable relationship, duly attested.
Article 3.2 also requires that The host member state shall undertake an extensive examination of the personal circumstances and shall justify any denial of entry or residence to these people.
Finally, of course, both Ms Sadovska and Mr Malik have rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Article 8.1 guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, although under article 8.2 interference is justified if it is in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society to achieve a legitimate aim.
Article 12 guarantees the right of men and women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of [the] right.
Analysis
It is clear from the provisions of the Directive quoted above that Ms Sadovska has a right of permanent residence in the United Kingdom.
As an EU citizen, under article 27.1, her freedom of movement can only be restricted on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.
As a permanent resident, under article 28 she could only be removed if those grounds are serious.
It is not suggested that she can be removed under article 28 on any of those grounds.
She can therefore only be removed, under article 35, if it is established that she has entered, or attempted to enter, into a marriage of convenience.
Furthermore, although the Regulations permit the respondent to take steps on the basis of reasonable grounds to suspect that that is the case, Ms Sadovska is entitled to an appeal where the facts and circumstances must be fully investigated.
That must mean, as held in Papajorgji, that the tribunal has to form its own view of the facts from the evidence presented.
The respondent is seeking to take away established rights.
One of the most basic rules of litigation is that he who asserts must prove.
It was not for Ms Sadovska to establish that the relationship was a genuine and lasting one.
It was for the respondent to establish that it was indeed a marriage of convenience.
For this purpose, marriage of convenience is a term of article Although it is defined in the Directive and the 2009 Communication as a marriage the sole purpose of which is to gain rights of entry to and residence in the European Union, the 2014 Handbook suggests a more flexible approach, in which this must be the predominant purpose.
It is not enough that the marriage may bring incidental immigration and other benefits if this is not its predominant purpose.
Furthermore, except in cases of deceit by the non EU national, this must be the purpose of them both.
Clearly, a non EU national may be guilty of abuse when the EU national is not, because she believes that it is a genuine relationship.
In the case of a person exercising EU law rights, the tribunal must also be satisfied that the removal would be a proportionate response to the abuse of rights established.
So it would be one thing to find that the proposed marriage had been shown to be one of convenience, and therefore that it was right to prevent it, but quite another thing to find that expelling Ms Sadovska from the country where she had lived and worked for so long and had other family members living was a proportionate response to that.
The First tier Tribunal did not analyse her rights in this way.
It was quite simply incorrect to deploy the statement that in immigration appeals the burden of proof is on the appellant, correct though it is in the generality of non EU cases, in her case.
She had established rights and it was for the respondent to prove that the quite narrow grounds existed for taking them away.
Nor did the determination address the issue of proportionality.
It is impossible for this court to conclude that, had the matter been approached in the right way, the decision would inevitably have been the same.
The position of Mr Malik is different, for he has no established rights, either in EU law or in non EU immigration law.
In order to benefit from the Directive, he would have to show that he has a durable relationship with Ms Sadovska.
However, article 3.2 requires the respondent to justify any refusal of entry or residence in such cases.
So if he can produce evidence of a durable relationship (a term which is not defined in the Directive), it would be for the respondent to show that it was not or that there were other good reasons to deny him entry.
It is not impossible that a tribunal, properly directing itself, would reach different conclusions in the case of these two appellants.
But it is impossible for this court to conclude that, had the matter been approached in the right way, the decision relating to Mr Malik would inevitably have been the same.
It follows that the appeal must be allowed and the case remitted for a full re hearing by the First tier Tribunal.
In seeking to establish its case, the respondent will no doubt concentrate on the interviews, the discrepancies between the appellants accounts, and the gaps in Ms Sadovskas knowledge of Mr Maliks family, together with the sentence in their statement of 28 March that their thoughts of living together and marriage had not yet manifested into action (which on 28 March was strictly true in that they were not yet living together or married but they had given notice of intention to marry).
But in considering those discrepancies, the circumstances in which the interviews took place and the statement was made must be borne fully in mind.
Furthermore, there were many matters on which their accounts were consistent.
It turns out, for example, that Ms Sadovskas mother does indeed live in Lithuania, as Mr Malik said in explaining why she was not there.
There is also a considerable body of evidence which supports their claim to have been in a genuine relationship, dating back some time before they gave notice of intention to marry.
Should the tribunal conclude that Mr Malik was delighted to find an EU national with whom he could form a relationship and who was willing to marry him, that does not necessarily mean that their marriage was a marriage of convenience, still less that Ms Sadovska was abusing her rights in entering into it.
Their legal and their factual cases must be considered separately.
Having reached the firm conclusion that the case must be remitted to the First tier Tribunal to be heard afresh, because a wrong approach was taken to the requirements of EU law in this case, it is unnecessary to consider whether the appellants Convention rights add anything further to their claims.
But for my part I would not accept their argument that, because their marriage was frustrated by the respondents actions, their case should be approached as if they were married, which would, of course, enhance Mr Maliks claims.
It must be permissible for the state to take steps to prevent sham marriages, although it is also incumbent on the state to show that the marriage would indeed be a sham.
","An EU citizen with a permanent right of residence in a host member state may have that right removed in the case of abuse of rights or fraud, such as marriages of convenience.
The issue in this appeal is which party bears the burden of proof of establishing that a proposed marriage is one of convenience.
Ms Sadovska is a citizen of Lithuania.
She moved to the United Kingdom in 2007 and has lived and worked here lawfully since, acquiring a right of permanent residence as an EU citizen pursuant to Directive 2004/38/EC (the Directive).
Mr Malik is a citizen of Pakistan who entered the UK with a student visa in May 2011 and has remained here unlawfully after his visas expiry in April 2013, in breach of section 10(1)(a) Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
Ms Sadovska and Mr Malik (the appellants) maintain that they have been in a relationship with each other since February 2013, and decided to marry in January 2014.
On 11 April 2014, the appellants solicitors notified the Home Office in Glasgow that they intended to marry on 17 April 2014 at Leith Registry Office and invited officials to interview them before the wedding.
Immigration officers arrived at the Registrars Office, interviewed the appellants separately, and then detained them before they were able to marry.
Both were then served with notice that they were persons liable to removal from the UK: Mr Malik by having stayed after the expiry of his visa and Ms Sadovska by giving the Secretary of State reasonable grounds to suspect the abuse of her EU right of residence by attempting to enter into a marriage of convenience, contrary to regulation 19(3)(c) Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.
The appellants appealed to the First tier Tribunal.
The judge held that the burden of proof was on the appellants to establish that their proposed marriage was not a marriage of convenience, and that they had failed to do this, having regard to the inconsistencies in their accounts at interview.
The appellants appealed unsuccessfully to the Upper Tribunal and to the First Division of the Inner House, arguing that the tribunal had adopted the wrong approach to the burden of proof, and that the Secretary of State had failed to prove that the appellants were guilty of fraud, when the totality of the evidence relating to their relationship and the circumstances in which the interviews had taken place was taken into account.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and remits the case for a full re hearing by the First tier Tribunal.
Lady Hale gives the only substantive judgment.
It was important to identify the different rights the appellants individually enjoyed, and thus what the Secretary of State needed to establish in order to remove them: Ms Sadovska had a right of permanent residence in the UK and could not be expelled unless she had abused her rights within the meaning of article 35 of the Directive.
A Communication in 2014 from the European Commission giving guidance on the Directive explained that a marriage of convenience was a marriage contracted with the predominant purpose of enjoying the right of free movement.
It was not enough that the marriage might bring incidental immigration and other benefits, and the predominant purpose must be the purpose of both parties [21 24, 29].
Mr Malik was liable to be removed as an over stayer.
Had he succeeded in marrying Ms Sadovska he would have acquired a right of residence in the UK under the Directive as a family member of an EU national working here.
The Directive also required member states to facilitate the entry and residence of the partner of an EU citizen if it was a durable relationship, duly attested [25 26].
Both appellants enjoyed rights under articles 8 and 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights to a private and family life, and to marry and found a family [27].
The 2006 Regulations permitted the Secretary of State to take steps to remove Ms Sadovska on the basis of reasonable grounds to suspect that she had entered or attempted to enter a marriage of convenience, but she was entitled to an appeal where the facts and circumstances were fully investigated.
The tribunal had to form its own view of the facts from the evidence presented.
It was not for her to establish that her relationship with Mr Malik was a genuine and lasting one, but for the Secretary of State to establish that it fell within the definition of a marriage of convenience [28].
The tribunal had also to be satisfied that the removal of Ms Sadovska from the country where she had lived and worked for so long with other family members would be a proportionate response to the abuse of rights, rather than merely the prevention of the marriage [30].
As the tribunal had not analysed Ms Sadovskas rights this way, it was not possible for the Supreme Court to conclude that the Secretary of State had proved that the narrow grounds for taking away her established rights existed [31].
Mr Malik had no established rights but if he could produce evidence of a durable relationship with Ms Sadovska, it would be for the Secretary of State to show that it was not, or that there were other good reasons to deny him entry.
Again, the Supreme Court could not conclude that, had his case been approached in the right way, the outcome would have inevitably been the same [32 33].
Accordingly, the burden of proof of establishing that the proposed marriage is one of convenience falls on the Secretary of State.
The appeal is allowed and the case remitted for a full rehearing by the First tier Tribunal, at which the inconsistencies in the appellants interviews will be considered along with their evidence supportive of a genuine relationship dating back several months, and the circumstances in which the interviews took place will also be taken into account [34].
The appellants ECHR rights did not add anything further to their claims in the light of this conclusion.
Such rights would not in any event prevent a state from taking steps to prevent sham marriages, if it could show that the marriage would indeed be a sham [35].
"
uksc-2012-0007,"The issue in this appeal is: what are the statutory consequences if the fingerprints of a defendant have been taken in a police station in Northern Ireland by an electronic device for which the legislation required approval from the Secretary of State, when such approval has never been given? In particular, is any evidence which makes use of the control fingerprints thus taken inadmissible in any subsequent court proceedings?
Article 61 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (the Northern Ireland Order) sets out the powers of the police to take fingerprints without consent.
Similar (but not in every respect identical) provision is made for England and Wales by section 61 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
These powers are exhaustively defined; otherwise prints may only be taken with consent see article 61(1) and, in England and Wales, section 61(1).
The cases where prints may be taken without consent have been varied a little from time to time and do not need to be set out seriatim here.
One of the principal cases, however, was and is where a person is in police detention having either been arrested for a reportable offence, or charged with, or informed that he will be reported for, such.
Another is where he has been convicted of such an offence.
Generally, fingerprints may be taken once only in the course of any single investigation, although there are now provisions permitting replacement prints to be required if the first ones were of insufficient quality to allow satisfactory analysis, comparison or matching.
Between 1 March 2007 and 12 January 2010 article 61(8B) of the Northern Ireland Order provided: Where a persons fingerprints are taken electronically, they must be taken only in such manner, and using such devices, as the Secretary of State has approved for the purposes of electronic fingerprinting.
That provision matched an intended section 61(8A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which latter provision was inserted into the 1984 Act by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 but was never brought into force.
Both article 61(8B) and section 61(8A) were later repealed as redundant by section 112 and schedule 8 of the Policing and Crime Act 2009, with effect from 12 January 2010, and with that repeal there disappeared from England and Wales and from Northern Ireland all requirement for statutory approval of fingerprinting devices.
However, although the requirement for approval existed in Northern Ireland (but not in England and Wales) from 1 March 2007, such approval was, by oversight, not given to any device until it was belatedly provided on 29 March 2009 after the omission had been noticed.
It follows that for the two years from March 2007 to March 2009 article 61(8B) was in force but no device had been approved as contemplated by it.
The two appellants were defendants charged with theft in Northern Ireland.
The offence was alleged to have taken place on 6 October 2007, during the two year period mentioned.
A stack of building materials had been found removed from the owners depot and placed apparently ready for collection by the thieves.
The appellants were found nearby in a van but said that they were there innocently and had not been near the stolen materials.
Their fingerprints were taken when they were detained in the police station after their arrest.
A fingerprint matching Elliotts left thumb was found on the packaging of the stolen materials.
The match of fingerprints was relied upon by the Crown and proved in the magistrates court.
The defendants were convicted.
The device used in the police station to collect the control sample of the fingerprints of each appellant was a combination of camera, scanner and computer, known as Livescan.
No one noticed that no type approval had been given for its use as required by article 61(8B).
When this was appreciated, the appellants appealed to the County Court, where the appeal proceeded by way of fresh hearing ab initio.
The preliminary point was taken that the evidence of comparison was inadmissible because of the absence of approval.
That argument succeeded before the County Court judge but on further appeal by the Crown, by way of case stated, the Court of Appeal ruled against it.
The Livescan process was and is generally used by the police throughout Northern Ireland, as well as throughout England and Wales and Scotland and, indeed, worldwide.
It has very largely superseded the traditional process of ink pad and paper.
It is possible to have mobile devices as well as those located in police stations.
Both are linked directly to computerised storage and searching equipment located centrally.
Amongst the advantages is the ease of electronic transmission, storage and sorting of the prints taken.
One aspect of that is that a set of fingerprints given at a scene or in the street can now often almost instantaneously verify or refute the identity of the person tested.
Another is that international exchange of data is made much easier.
Livescan devices were in general use in Northern Ireland from 2006 and throughout the two year period 2007 2009 when type approval was required by article 61(8B).
For the appellants, the first and principal submission of Mr McMahon QC is
that the language of article 61(8B) unequivocally renders a nullity any fingerprints taken by a device which has not been approved.
Therefore, no legal use can be made of them.
For this reason, there is, he submits, no occasion to investigate what consequences Parliament must have intended should follow from a failure to use an approved device.
That would be necessary only if there were an ambiguity in the wording.
There is none, and it necessarily follows that the product of an unapproved fingerprinting process is inadmissible.
Any other conclusion would, he submits, leave article 61(8B) a dead letter.
The difficulty with this attractively simple submission is that the statute says nothing at all about the consequences of failure to use an approved device.
There is ample precedent for such a statutory provision to be accompanied by an express provision that evidence shall only be admissible if obtained in accordance with it.
An example is afforded by the statutory rules relating to evidence of speed provided by speed guns.
Section 20 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 provides, for England and Wales: (1) Evidenceof a fact relevant to proceedings for an offence to which this section applies may be given by the production of a record produced by a prescribed device, and (a) (b) (4) A record produced or measurement made by a prescribed device shall not be admissible as evidence of a fact relevant to proceedings for an offence to which this section applies unless the device is of a type approved by the Secretary (a) of State, and (b) any conditions subject to which the approval was given are satisfied.
Identical provisions are contained in the equivalent Northern Ireland legislation: article 23(1) and (4) of the Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
There are provisions to similar effect in section 6 of the Noise Act 1996, and in section 45 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004, in respect of noise meters.
The absence of this kind of explicit statutory provision from article 61(8B) thus raises the question of what consequence was intended to follow from non approval.
This legislation was enacted against the background of the well understood
general common law rule that evidence which has been unlawfully obtained does not automatically thereby become inadmissible.
That has been clear since at least the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Kuruma v The Queen [1955] AC 197, where the defendant was charged with unlawful possession of ammunition which had been found on him as a result of an unlawful search, carried out by a policeman of insufficient seniority to make it.
Lord Goddard CJ said this at p 203: In their Lordships opinion the test to be applied in considering whether evidence is admissible is whether it is relevant to the matters in issue.
If it is, it is admissible and the court is not concerned with how the evidence was obtained.
This proposition was endorsed by the House of Lords in R v Sang [1980] AC 402, which dealt more specifically with the judges discretion to exclude evidence which will have the effect of rendering the trial unfair (see now section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and its equivalent, article 76 of the Northern Ireland Order).
Likewise in R v Khan [1997] AC 558 evidence obtained by unauthorised surveillance and the secret recording of private conversations was admissible despite the unlawful methods by which it had been obtained.
The position was summarised by Lord Fraser, with whom all other members of the House of Lords agreed, in Fox v Chief Constable of Gwent [1986] AC 281, 292A as follows: It is a well established rule of English law, which was recognised in R v Sang, that (apart from confessions as to which special considerations apply) any evidence which is relevant is admissible even if it has been obtained illegally.
It is clear that this inclusive rule of relevant evidence extends equally to evidence created by an unlawful process as it does to existing material uncovered by unlawful process; the recording in Khan is an example of the former.
This common law background to the legislation, of which Parliament must be taken to have been well aware, shows that inadmissibility of the fingerprints here under consideration cannot possibly simply follow from the existence of the requirement for device approval.
Rather, it is necessary to examine the Parliamentary intention as to consequence.
With great respect to Mr McMahons principal argument, it is not correct that article 61(8B) would have no purpose, or would be a dead letter, unless its consequence were that any fingerprints obtained from an unapproved device were inadmissible.
Whether or not inadmissibility is the consequence, the article still meant that a requirement by a policeman of a suspect in custody that he provide his fingerprints on an unapproved device would be one which the suspect was entitled to refuse.
It might not be very likely that a suspect would be acquainted with the presence or absence of approval, but his solicitor might well be.
Such a suspect could therefore refuse to provide his fingerprints on a Livescan device and he would not thereby commit the offence of obstructing a police officer that no doubt he otherwise would.
Similarly, if it became known that the police were regularly using an unapproved device, there would be no defence to an application for judicial review in which the unlawfulness of their actions would be declared and, if persisted in, no doubt prohibited.
Thus the clear statutory purpose of preventing the use of a device unless it is approved by the Secretary of State would be achieved.
There is no need for the additional consequence of inadmissibility of evidence in order to give content to the statute.
It follows that the wording of article 61(8B) does not itself provide the solution to the issue in this appeal.
It is necessary to examine the question what Parliament must have intended to be the consequence of non approval of Livescan.
The correct approach to this enquiry was explained by Lord Steyn in R v Soneji [2005] UKHL 49; [2006] 1 AC 340.
It had previously been thought that statutory provisions could be classified as either mandatory (carrying the consequence of total invalidity for breach) or directory (carrying lesser consequence).
The over rigidity of that a priori approach had given rise to difficulty.
At para 23 Lord Steyn said this: Having reviewed the issue in some detail I am in respectful agreement with the Australian High Court [in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355] that the rigid mandatory and directory distinction, and its many artificial refinements, have outlived their usefulness.
Instead, as held in Attorney Generals Reference (No 3 of 1999) [2001] 2 AC 91, the emphasis ought to be on the consequences of non compliance, and posing the question whether Parliament can fairly be taken to have intended total invalidity.
That is how I would approach what is ultimately a question of statutory construction.
That more flexible approach does not necessarily mean that failure to comply with statutory provisions may not have far reaching consequences.
It may sometimes yield the conclusion that the inevitable consequence is total invalidity.
That was the outcome in R v Clarke and McDaid [2008] UKHL 8; [2008] 1 WLR 338, where the question was whether the failure to sign an indictment nullified the ensuing trial.
The statutory provisions there in question were sections 1(1) and 2(1) of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 which provided for a bill of indictment (which had of itself no legal standing save as a proposal of charges) to become an indictment when signed.
It was common ground that a valid indictment was a pre condition to a valid Crown Court trial.
It can be seen from Lord Binghams speech at para 18 that he faithfully posed the Soneji question, namely what Parliament had intended, when passing the 1933 Act, should be the consequence of lack of signature.
Since at the time of the 1933 Act the signature was taking the place of the previously existing endorsement of the bill by a Grand Jury, the answer was inescapable, if inconvenient: the signature validated the indictment in the same way as the Grand Jurys decision previously had done.
Accordingly the absence of signature did indeed invalidate the subsequent trial, notwithstanding the fact that modern changes in the routes by which criminal cases arrive in the court of trial had in the meantime reduced the signature, in practice, to mere formality.
The position had to be put right by amending legislation, in the form of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.
Should a similar parliamentary intention be deduced from article 61(8B)? Mr McMahon relies upon the well established rule that the product of a breathaliser test is inadmissible unless the testing device is an approved one.
The cases begin with Scott v Baker [1969] 1 QB 659, decided in the infancy of the Road Safety Act 1967, which had introduced for the first time the offence of driving with blood alcohol beyond a prescribed statutory limit.
The power to require a suspect to provide a laboratory blood or urine sample, by which blood alcohol could be tested, was made dependent upon a complex step by step procedure.
The first step in that procedure was the taking of a preliminary (usually roadside) breath test.
By section 7 a breath test was defined as one carried out using a device approved by the Secretary of State.
The court held that such approval was essential to the statutory steps leading to a validly required laboratory sample, and that approval must be proved.
The details of the blood alcohol driving legislation have been changed from time to time since then, and breath tests of a different kind are nowadays used not simply as a screening test but to determine the blood alcohol level.
However, it remains the statutory rule, under section 7(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and, in Northern Ireland, under article 18(1) of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, that a specimen of breath may be required in the course of an investigation into the offences of driving with excess alcohol, or of driving when unfit through drink or drugs, or of causing death by careless or dangerous driving when over the limit or under the influence, and that what may be thus required is limited to: specimens of breath for analysis by means of a device of a type approved by [the appropriate person.] Mr McMahon is therefore right to say that a breath specimen may be adduced in evidence against a defendant not only when the result constitutes the very offence of driving with excess alcohol but also where it is simply some part of the evidence relied on to prove an offence with different components, such as driving when unfit through drink.
No one doubts the rule, however, that the product of a breath test will not be admissible unless the device used is an approved one.
The statutory requirement for approval of an electronic fingerprint reader is not, however, analogous to the approval requirements in the cases of breath test or speed gun devices.
Both the latter are methods of measuring something which cannot subsequently be re measured.
They capture a snapshot of a suspects activity.
The snapshot is often itself the offence.
It is the speed, as measured by the device, which constitutes the offence of exceeding the speed limit.
It is the blood alcohol content, as measured by the device, which constitutes the offence of driving with excess alcohol.
In other cases, the snapshot is simply part of the evidence, for example if the offence charged is careless driving, or driving whilst unfit through drink.
But in both kinds of situation, the activity measured by the device cannot be reproduced to be re measured.
It is therefore entirely comprehensible that there should be a statutory requirement that the device should be approved, and that the measurements which can be relied upon in evidence should be limited to the products of such devices.
That is no doubt why there are the specific statutory provisions in relation to speed guns described at para 8 above, and it is clearly why the courts have held that the requirements for approval in the case of breath tests have the like effect.
The control fingerprints taken from the appellants in the police station were not snapshots.
The impressions which their fingers provided could be reproduced at any time afterwards, and would be the same.
The accuracy of the Livescan readings, if disputed, could readily be checked independently by the appellants providing more samples, whether by ink and paper or by any other means, for examination by an independent expert.
The ease with which this can at any time be done demonstrates that there was no need at all for Parliament to stipulate, or to intend, that the product of unapproved electronic fingerprint readers should be inadmissible.
It is the fact that in the present case there was no challenge whatever to the accuracy of the control fingerprints taken from Elliott by the Livescan device; the fingerprint found at the scene matched his control prints in no less than 45 particulars and there was no sign of any reliance on expert opinion either in the magistrates court or, after the absence of approval was appreciated, in the County Court.
But if there had been a dispute, as in other cases it is at least possible that there might be, it would have been the simplest possible matter for new control prints to be provided so that independent expert opinion could be obtained.
There appeared at first to be some limited support for the appellants contentions in an explanatory note which accompanied the proposed insertion into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 of section 61(8A) requiring type approval of electronic fingerprint readers.
That amendment of the 1984 Act would have been achieved through section 78(7) of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, had that subsection ever been brought into force.
The explanatory note to that subsection (number 234) read as follows: Subsection (7) provides that where fingerprints are taken electronically, the device used must have type approval from the Secretary of State.
This is to ensure that the device will produce images of the appropriate quality and integrity to be used for evidential purposes.
However, the other background material shown to this court demonstrates that the purpose of the proposal for type approval was not principally the protection of the individual against risk of conviction on inaccurate evidence.
The concern was much more closely related to the needs for the technology to work properly so that investigations could proceed confidently, for compatibility between police forces, both domestic and foreign, and for uniform machinery for search and comparison.
The then Minister of State referred to the aim of facilitating a proper evidential trail.
The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology had emphasised the need for the technology to be robust.
It is also clear that there was thought at one time that type approval would curtail any potential for unnecessary dispute in court about the legitimacy of electronically taken control fingerprints.
The initial recommendation of the Police Scientific Development Branch had been against any stipulation for type approval.
The reasons for that stance included the difficulty of formulating a test standard and the frequency of developments to many of the component parts of the system.
The successful operation of Livescan in England and Wales over a decade without any type approval, as well as the experience in Northern Ireland, clearly contributed to the subsequent decision in 2009 not to commence the amendment to the English statute, and to repeal both article 61(8B) and the uncommenced section 61(8A).
Overall the legislative history does not suggest any basis for concluding that Parliament intended that the consequence of use of unapproved apparatus should be the exclusion of the evidence.
Such a consequence would, it is clear, be unnecessary and inappropriate.
It is unnecessary because a reading of control fingerprints can always be checked subsequently.
It is inappropriate because to exclude such evidence would deprive courts of reliable and relevant material.
Since the product can be checked, and the evidence it provides is relevant, it ought to be admissible.
If it were not, it would not be open to the police to take further control fingerprints without the consent of the subject, because he would no longer be in detention following arrest on suspicion of the offence, nor would he have been convicted of it.
If the control fingerprints were to be inadmissible, not only would there be a windfall benefit to those who have committed crimes, perhaps of great gravity, but also defendants would be unable to rely on the evidence of the fingerprints of others when it was necessary for them to do so in order to defend themselves.
A defendant who wished to show that a fingerprint found in an incriminating place belonged to another person, whom he contends committed the offence rather than himself, would be unable to adduce the evidence to do so.
Some years after the provisions which we have here to construe, the Protection of Freedoms Act was enacted in 2012.
Part 1, Chapter 1 contains, by way of proposed amendments to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, prospective provisions relating to fingerprints and other biometric data.
Equivalent provision for the amendment of the Northern Ireland Order is made by section 9 of and Schedule 2 to the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2013.
Neither set of provisions is yet in force but there is a proposed timetable for commencement.
If and when these provisions are commenced they will provide for the destruction of fingerprints and other data in certain defined circumstances and/or after prescribed periods.
There is express provision in proposed new section 63T(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (and in proposed new article 63Q(2) of the Northern Ireland Order) making inadmissible (at least against the person to whom the material relates) fingerprints or other data which the police have come under a duty to destroy.
This proposed statutory scheme is consistent with the construction of the provisions we are considering in the present case.
Where the intention is to make material inadmissible, express provision is made saying so, in the same way as it was in the statutes considered at para 8 above.
Moreover, the proposed new scheme for destruction of biometric data is clearly founded on a view of individual rights which was considered to justify the consequence of inadmissibility if there is a duty to destroy the material.
Such considerations do not apply to type approval for the machinery of taking fingerprints which there is no requirement to destroy.
For these reasons it is clear that the correct conclusion is that Parliament did not intend, by enacting article 61(8B), that the consequence of an absence of approval should be to render inadmissible any fingerprints produced electronically.
The decision of the Court of Appeal that the evidence of Elliots control fingerprints was admissible was correct.
It follows that this appeal must be dismissed.
","The issue in the appeal is: what are the statutory consequences if the fingerprints of a defendant have been taken in a police station in Northern Ireland by an electronic device for which the legislation required approval from the Secretary of State, when such approval has never been given? In particular, is any evidence which makes use of the fingerprints taken on such a device inadmissible at the defendants trial? The appellants were charged with theft in Northern Ireland.
The offence was alleged to have taken place on 6 October 2007.
A stack of building materials had been found removed from the owners depot apparently ready for collection by thieves.
The appellants were found nearby in a van but said they were waiting there innocently.
They were arrested and their fingerprints were taken at the police station using an electronic fingerprint scanner called Livescan.
This machine has been commonly used by police in the UK, including in Northern Ireland, for a number of years.
A fingerprint matching Elliotts left thumb was found on packaging of the building materials.
Article 61 of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order sets out the powers of the police to take fingerprints without consent.
Between 1 March 2007 and 12 January 2010 article 61(8B) provided that where a persons fingerprints are taken electronically, they may only be taken using such devices, as the Secretary of State has approved for the purpose of electronic fingerprinting.
Due to an oversight no approval was ever given to any device (including Livescan) until it was belatedly provided on 29 March 2009.
Article 61(8B) was later repealed by the Policing and Crime Act 2009.
Therefore at the time the fingerprints were taken from the appellants there was no approval for the Livescan machine in breach of article 61 (8B).
The appellants were convicted at trial and no issue over the fingerprints was taken.
After the lack of approval for the Livescan device was noticed the appellants appealed to the County Court which, after a full re hearing, declared the fingerprint evidence inadmissible and acquitted the appellants.
The Public Prosecution Service appealed to the Court of Appeal who allowed the appeal and reinstated the appellants convictions.
The appellants primary argument before the Supreme Court and the courts below was that the lack of approval for the Livescan device meant that the fingerprints obtained with it were automatically inadmissible at the appellants trial.
The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.
Lord Hughes gives the judgment of the court.
The difficulty with the appellants argument is that the statute says nothing about the potential consequences of failure to use an approved device.
This is despite the fact that there are numerous examples of other statutes where such consequences are expressly spelled out, such as in relation to obtaining specimens of breath for road traffic offences [8].
There is a well understood common law rule that evidence which has been obtained unlawfully does not automatically become inadmissible.
It is clear that this rule extends equally to evidence created by an unlawful process as it does to existing material uncovered by unlawful process.
The common law background to the legislation (article 61 (8B)) shows that inadmissibility of the fingerprints here under consideration cannot possibly simply follow from the existence of the requirement for device approval [9].
It is not correct to say that article 61 (8B) would have no purpose unless fingerprints obtained from unapproved devices were inadmissible at trial.
A defendant who was asked to give a fingerprint on an unapproved device could lawfully refuse to do so.
While, if such devices were found to be routinely in use by police, there would be no defence to an application for judicial review in which their unlawfulness could be declared and further use prohibited [10].
The appellants relied on the rule that the product of a breathalyser test was inadmissible unless the testing device was an approved one.
However, the requirement for approval of fingerprint devices is not analogous to that in cases of breath tests or speed guns.
The latter are methods of measuring something that cannot be re measured, they capture a snapshot of the suspects activity and are often the offence itself i.e. being found to be over the prescribed limit of alcohol at the time of driving.
The fingerprints on the other hand could be reproduced at any time afterwards, and would be the same.
If the Livescan readings were disputed they could readily be independently checked for accuracy and further fingerprints taken by a different method.
The ease of which this could be done shows there was no need for Parliament to stipulate that the product of unapproved fingerprint readers should be inadmissible.
Further, no challenge was ever made by the appellants to the accuracy of the fingerprints taken by the Livescan device [15].
The background material to the legislation shown to the Court further shows that the purpose of the requirement for device approval was not principally the protection of the individual against the risk of conviction on inaccurate evidence [16].
Relevant parts of the Protection for Freedoms Act 2012 and Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2013 regarding fingerprints that have yet to come into force further support the construction of the legislation chosen by the Supreme Court in this case as, where required, express provision is made for evidence to be inadmissible [18].
"
uksc-2013-0273,"Section 28 of the Housing Act 1988 (the 1988 Act) identifies a measure of damages payable by a landlord to a residential occupier of premises whom he has unlawfully evicted from them.
Construction of the section is not straightforward.
On 25 September 2012 His Honour Judge Blunsdon, sitting in the Lambeth County Court, determined a claim for damages brought by Mr Loveridge against the London Borough of Lambeth (Lambeth).
Mr Loveridge had been a residential occupier of premises let to him by Lambeth.
The judge found that it had unlawfully evicted him from them.
By reference to the construction of it which he favoured, the judge awarded Mr Loveridge damages of 90,500 under section 28 as well as of 9,000 otherwise than under the section.
Lambeth appealed to the Court of Appeal against the judges award of damages under section 28.
On 10 May 2013, by a judgment delivered by Briggs LJ with which Arden LJ and Sir Stanley Burnton agreed, [2013] EWCA Civ 494, [2013] 1 WLR 3390, the court favoured a different construction of the section, which led it to order that Lambeths appeal be allowed, that the judges award under section 28 be set aside in its entirety but that the award of damages otherwise than under the section be increased to 16,400.
Against these orders Mr Loveridge now appeals.
In November 2002 Lambeth granted to Mr Loveridge a weekly tenancy of a flat at 19 Moresby Walk, London SW8.
The tenancy was secure within the meaning of section 79 of the Housing Act 1985.
The flat was on the ground floor and was self contained with one bedroom.
It was one of two flats in a purpose built two storey building and at all material times the flat upstairs, namely 20 Moresby Walk, was also subject to a secure tenancy.
On 9 July 2009 Mr Loveridge went to Ghana, from where he did not return until 5 December 2009.
He was in breach of a term of the tenancy agreement which required him to notify Lambeth of any absence from the flat for more than eight weeks.
But he continued to pay the rent.
On 22 September 2009, believing that he had died, Lambeth effected forcible entry to the flat; took possession of it by changing the locks; and left a notice to quit, expressed to expire on 26 October 2009.
At around that expiry date it also cleared out his belongings and disposed of them.
Two days after his return to England, but when he was unable to prevent it, Lambeth let the flat to somebody else.
The judge rejected Lambeths contention that prior to 22 September 2009 Mr Loveridge had ceased to occupy the flat as his principal home and that his tenancy had therefore ceased to be secure.
It was on that basis that the judge held Lambeths eviction of him to have been unlawful.
It was agreed that his damages in respect of its trespass to his goods amounted to 9000; and so it was in respect of their trespass that the judge added 9,000 to his award of 90,500. 3.
The parties further agreed that, at common law, the damages for any unlawful eviction of Mr Loveridge from the flat during the subsistence of a secure tenancy amounted to 7,400.
Mr Loveridge contended, however, that he was entitled to a higher sum by way of damages under sections 27 and 28 of the 1988 Act and he conceded that, if so, he was precluded by section 27(5) from also receiving damages at common law in respect of the eviction. 4.
The main purpose behind the 1988 Act was set out in a White Paper, Cm 214, entitled Housing: The Governments Proposals and presented to Parliament in September 1987.
That purpose, set out in Chapter 3, was to stimulate the availability of rented accommodation in the private sector by making lettings more attractive to private landlords.
This was to be achieved by provisions which extended the ambit of two types of tenancy which had been introduced by sections 56 and 52 of the Housing Act 1980.
The first was the assured tenancy in which, when letting certain types of property, the landlord had been entitled to extract a market rent rather than a lower, fair, rent, albeit that his entitlement to recover possession at the end of the term had been restricted.
The second was the protected shorthold tenancy in which, albeit at risk of a reduction of the contractual rent to a fair rent, the landlord had been entitled to recover possession at the end of the term.
The 1988 Act duly extended the circumstances in which an assured tenancy could be granted; and it amended the description of a protected shorthold tenancy to an assured shorthold tenancy and changed its nature so as to enable the landlord to charge a market, rather than a fair, rent as well as to remain unshackled by any significant security of tenure on the part of the tenant at the end of the contractual term. 5.
But the government, when introducing the bill which became the 1988 Act, and Parliament, when enacting it, both realised that it created a danger.
It was that some unscrupulous landlords, tempted by the prospect of entering into new tenancies on terms much more favourable to themselves (or of selling their properties with vacant possession in what in 1988 was a spiralling real property market), would seek to drive out such of their existing tenants as, under the Rent Act 1977, enjoyed protection in respect both of rent and of security of tenure.
So, in the White Paper, the government wrote: 3.17 It is important that existing tenants whose Rent Act rights will be preserved should be protected against the minority of landlords who may be prepared to harass them in order to obtain vacant possession and to relet at higher rents.
The Government therefore proposes to increase the existing statutory protection by creating a new offence where the landlord harasses the tenant .
The Government also proposes to strengthen the civil law to enable tenants who have been evicted illegally or forced out by harassment to claim greater compensation.
This would be an important additional deterrent to harassment. 6.
The facility for the unlawfully evicted tenant to claim enlarged compensation was duly provided in sections 27 and 28 of the 1988 Act, which are in Chapter IV of Part 1 of it.
The chapter is entitled Protection from Eviction.
Section 27 is entitled Damages for unlawful eviction.
Subsection (1) provides: 7.
This section applies if, at any time after 9th June 1988, a landlord (in this section referred to as the landlord in default) unlawfully deprives the residential occupier of any premises of his occupation of the whole or part of the premises. 8. 9.
Section 27(2) provides that the section also applies if, in summary, the residential occupier yields occupation as a result of acts of harassment on the part of a landlord who knew that they were likely to have that result.
Section 27(3), (4) and (5) provides: (3) Subject to the following provisions of this section, where this section applies, the landlord in default shall, by virtue of this section, be liable to pay to the former residential occupier, in respect of his loss of the right to occupy the premises in question as his residence, damages assessed on the basis set out in section 28 below. (4) Any liability arising by virtue of subsection (3) above (a) shall be in the nature of a liability in tort; and (b) subject to subsection (5) below, shall be in addition to any liability arising apart from this section (whether in tort, contract or otherwise). (5) Nothing in this section affects the right of a residential occupier to enforce any liability which arises apart from this section in respect of his loss of the right to occupy premises as his residence; but damages shall not be awarded both in respect of such a liability and in respect of a liability arising by virtue of this section on account of the same loss. 10.
Section 27(6) provides that the landlord is not liable to pay damages under subsection (3) if in certain circumstances the occupier is reinstated in the premises. 11.
Section 27(7) gives the court power to reduce damages under subsection (3) if, in summary, the occupiers conduct prior to the eviction makes it reasonable to do so or if the landlord had offered to reinstate him.
The trial judge declined Lambeths invitation to him to exercise this power.
Although in a second ground of appeal Lambeth challenged his ruling in this respect, and although the Court of Appeal noted that in the light of its conclusion on the first ground the second ground did not need to be determined, Lambeth no longer pursues it even in the event that Mr Loveridges appeal to this court were to succeed. 12.
Section 27(8) provides the landlord with a defence to liability for damages under subsection (3) if, in summary, he proves that, when he deprived the occupier of occupation, he believed, and had reasonable cause to believe, that the occupier had ceased to reside in them.
Lambeth raised this defence before the trial judge but he rejected it and Lambeth did not appeal against his ruling in this respect. 13.
Section 27(9) provides definitions which apply both to that section and, by virtue of section 28(4), also to section 28.
Two of the definitions are material. (a) The first, at (a), is the definition of residential occupier, which is to have the meaning set out in section 1 of the Protection from Eviction Act 1977, namely a person occupying premises as a residence, whether (as in the case of Mr Loveridge) under a contract or by virtue of any enactment or rule of law giving him the right to remain there. (b) The second, at (b), is the definition of a residential occupiers right to occupy, which is to include any restriction on the right of another person to recover possession of the premises in question. 14.
Section 28 is entitled The measure of damages.
Its relevant provisions are as follows and, since the issue surrounding its construction primarily relates to the terms of subsections (1)(a) and (3)(a), I will set them in bold: (1) The basis for the assessment of damages referred to in section 27(3) above is the difference in value, determined as at the time immediately before the residential occupier ceased to occupy the premises in question as his residence, between (a) the value of the interest of the landlord in default determined on the assumption that the residential occupier continues to have the same right to occupy the premises as before that time; and (b) the value of that interest determined on the assumption that the residential occupier has ceased to have that right.
In relation to any premises, any reference in this section to the interest of the landlord in default is a reference to his interest in the building in which the premises in question are comprised (whether or not that building contains any other premises) together with its curtilage.
For the purposes of the valuations referred to in subsection (1) above, it shall be assumed (a) that the landlord in default is selling his interest on the open market to a willing buyer; (b) . (2) (3) Although section 27(3) describes the damages payable to the tenant under section 28 as being in respect of his loss of the right to occupy, it is clear that they are designed to yield to him not the amount of his loss but, exceptionally, the amount of the gain which the landlord would otherwise have achieved by reason of the eviction. 15.
It is clear that the principal target of sections 27 and 28 of the 1988 Act was the unscrupulous private landlord saddled with a tenancy protected, in terms both of rent and of security, by the Rent Act 1977 and therefore created prior to 15 January 1989, after which, as a result of section 34 of the 1988 Act, such a tenancy could not generally be created.
Local authority landlords rarely perpetrate unlawful evictions of their tenants.
When they do so, it is usually, as here, as a result of honest misjudgement and scarcely ever (although it was found to have occurred in AA v London Borough of Southwark [2014] EWHC 500 (QB)) as a result of any deliberate intention to act unlawfully.
A local authority will not be motivated to seek to deploy its housing stock for gain.
Nevertheless the words of section 27 are wide enough to cover an unlawful eviction on the part of a local authority; and when, as in the case of tenancies from the Crown, Parliament wished to exclude the operation of section 27 (and thus of section 28), it expressly so provided: section 44(2)(a).
So it is agreed that the sections apply to an unlawful eviction of a tenant by a local authority. 16.
Section 28(1) of the 1988 Act requires the court to make two valuations, namely (a) and (b), as at the time immediately prior to the unlawful eviction.
Both valuations are of the landlords interest, which, by virtue of subsection (2), means his interest in the building in which the demised premises are comprised even if it contains other premises.
In the present case it was therefore agreed that the valuations were to relate to Lambeths interest in the whole two storey building at Moresby Walk, including the upstairs flat. 17.
The two valuations are to be determined on different assumptions.
Valuation (a) is to be based on the assumption that the tenant continues to have the same right to occupy the premises as he had prior to his eviction.
Indeed, in the light of the definition in section 27(9)(b) of the Act, the assumption that he continues to have the same right to occupy includes an assumption that he continues to enjoy the benefit of the same restrictions on the landlords right to recover possession as he enjoyed prior to the eviction.
Valuation (b), by contrast, is to be based on the assumption that the tenant ceased to have that right, including that he ceased to enjoy that benefit. 18.
The valuation exercises mandated by section 28(1)(a) and (b) of the 1988 Act would have been straightforward but for the further assumption which is mandated by section 28(3)(a).
This provides that, for the purposes of both valuations, it shall be assumed that the landlord is selling his interest on the open market to a willing buyer.
The interface between section 28(3)(a) and section 28(1)(a) is at the heart of the appeal. 19.
Of course the notion that Lambeth would put the building at 19 and 20 Moresby Walk on the open market for sale is fanciful in the extreme.
It could not dispose of the building without the consent of the Secretary of State: section 32(2) of the Housing Act 1985, as inserted by section 6(2) of and Schedule 1 to the Housing and Planning Act 1986.
And, in the event of its proposed disposal to a private sector landlord, Lambeth would be required to consult the tenants and the Secretary of State could not give his consent if a majority of them had objected to it: paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of Schedule 3A to the 1985 Act.
It is agreed, however, that these formidable obstacles to sale are irrelevant.
For the mandatory assumption is that Lambeth is indeed selling its interest on the open market.
As Lord Donaldson of Lymington, Master of the Rolls, said in Tagro v Cafane [1991] 1 WLR 378, 387: the whole concept of the landlord selling his interest on the open market to a willing buyer assumes that he can sell it on the open market to a willing buyer 20. 21.
It is further agreed that the least absurd hypothesis would indeed be of a sale to an ordinary private landlord rather than, say, to another local authority or to a private registered provider of social housing.
The ordinary private landlord would be interested in purchasing the building for a simple reason: that, in his hands, the two sets of premises there could both generate market rents.
Upon sale to him the secure tenancies held by the two tenants immediately prior thereto would cease to exist because the landlord condition of a secure tenancy would no longer be satisfied: sections 79 and 80 of the Housing Act 1985.
Instead section 1(1) of the 1988 Act would convert the tenancies to being assured and would therefore confer on the landlord the power to bring the rents up to market level pursuant to sections 13 and 14 of that Act.
It now becomes possible to explain the dispute between the parties about the nature of the valuations mandated by section 28 of the 1988 Act. 22.
Mr Jenner was the chartered surveyor and valuer whom both parties initially instructed to provide valuations. (a) In respect of valuation (a), his instructions, once refined, were to value the building as at 22 September 2009 on the assumption that both flats were subject to secure tenancies.
By reference to a capitalisation of the rents payable under the tenancies, Mr Jenners valuation (a) was in the sum of 123,000. (b) In respect of valuation (b), his instructions were to value the building as at 22 September 2009 on the assumption that the owner had vacant possession of the downstairs flat but that the upstairs flat was subject to a secure tenancy.
By reference to the market value of properties comparable to the downstairs flat and to a capitalisation of the rent payable for the upstairs flat, Mr Jenners valuation (b) was in the sum of 213,500. (c) So the difference between Mr Jenners valuations (a) and (b) was 90,500, being the sum which the trial judge awarded to Mr Loveridge by way of damages under section 28. 23.
Mr Robson was the chartered surveyor and valuer whom, with the courts permission, Lambeth instructed to provide valuations notwithstanding its prior joint instruction of Mr Jenner.
It asked him to provide them on three different assumptions, of which it is only to the third that I need to refer, namely a sale on 22 September 2009 to an ordinary private landlord. (a) (b) In respect of valuation (a), his instructions were therefore to value the building as at 22 September 2009 on the assumption that both flats had then become subject to assured tenancies.
By reference to market comparables, Mr Robsons valuation (a) was in the sum of 304,000.
In respect of valuation (b), his instructions were to value the building as at 22 September 2009 on the assumption that the owner had vacant possession of the downstairs flat but that the upstairs flat had then become subject to an assured tenancy.
By reference to market comparables, Mr Robsons valuation (b) was again in the sum of 304,000.
For his opinion, not challenged by Mr Jenner, was that in 2009 there was no difference between the value of 19 Moresby Walk if bought with vacant possession and if bought subject to an assured tenancy. (c) So the difference between Mr Robsons valuations (a) and (b) was nil, being the sum which the Court of Appeal considered to be Mr Loveridges entitlement under section 28. 24.
The issue is, therefore, whether the valuations of both flats (for valuation (a)) and of the upstairs flat (for valuation (b)) should be conducted on the assumption that they are subject to secure tenancies or to assured tenancies. 25.
Lambeths case is primarily constructed upon section 28(3)(a) of the 1988 Act, which requires the assumption of a sale by the landlord on the open market.
It contends that a market valuation of property must take into account a change in the use which a purchaser might make of the property and for which he may therefore make allowance in his offer.
In this respect it cites the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Raja Vyricherla Narayana Gajapathiraju v Revenue Divisional Officer, Vizagapatam [1939] AC 302, in which it was held that the market value of land subject to compulsory purchase should include such extra value as might be paid for the facility to collect fresh water which was generated by a spring on the land but which was presently going to waste.
Lord Romer, at p 313, described it as self evident that the land was to be valued by reference not merely to the use to which it was being put but to the uses to which it was reasonably capable of being put. 26.
With respect, Lord Romers proposition remains self evident.
But the exercise mandated by section 28 of the 1988 Act is more complicated than an identification of market value.
The assumption of a sale on the open market is for the purposes of the valuations referred to in subsection (1), in which other assumptions are mandated, namely (a) that the tenant continues to have the same right to occupy the premises as he had immediately prior to the eviction and, alternatively, (b) that he has ceased to have that right. 27.
What was the right which Mr Loveridge had to occupy the downstairs flat immediately prior to the eviction? It was the right of a secure tenant.
Lambeth correctly argues that the consequence of a notional sale to a private landlord would be to convert the status of Mr Loveridges tenancy (and indeed that of the tenancy upstairs) from secured to assured.
But in my view the notional exercise mandated by subsection 3(a) of section 28 does not extend to making the consequential adjustments to the nature of Mr Loveridges right (or indeed that of the tenant upstairs) consequent upon sale.
For that is barred by the words of subsection 1(a).
Within this highly artificial exercise, regard to the effect of one assumption is halted by the terms of another. 28.
The decision of the Court of Appeal in Osei Bonsu v Wandsworth LBC [1999] 1 WLR 1011 relates to another rare example of an unlawful eviction of a secure tenant by a local authority.
As here, it was as a result of the local authoritys honest misjudgement.
Under section 28 of the 1988 Act the trial judge awarded the tenant damages of 30,000.
The court upheld Wandsworths argument that the award should have been reduced by two thirds pursuant to section 27(7).
But Wandsworth also sought to challenge the figure of 30,000, which, as it had earlier agreed, represented the difference between the value of the house subject to a secure tenancy and its value with vacant possession.
The court held that it was too late for Wandsworth to resile from the agreement.
But it noted both Wandsworths proposed contention, which, but for the lateness, it regarded as strong, and the tenants proposed rebuttal of it, which it regarded as weak.
Wandsworths proposed contention was that the tenants secure tenancy was held only jointly with his estranged wife and that therefore Wandsworth, which was in the process of rehousing her, had only to persuade her to serve it with a valid notice to quit for the tenancy to come to an end.
There was therefore a feature of his tenure prior to the eviction which was unrelated to the notional sale and yet which made it extremely fragile.
The tenants proposed rebuttal was that the hypothesis was of a sale by Wandsworth and that no purchaser would be likely to enjoy the same power of persuasion over the wife as Wandsworth enjoyed.
In a judgment with which the other members of the court agreed, Simon Brown LJ said at p 1022: The clear answer to this argument, I am satisfied, lies in [Wandsworths] submission that what is being valued is the interest of the landlord not the abstract interest of a notional willing buyer.
Although the concept of a willing buyer helps to fix the respective valuations, one postulates the landlords continuing ownership in fact.
Although it may take time to understand his last sentence, Simon Brown LJ there expressed the view, with which I respectfully agree, that the likely effect of a sale upon the subsistence or otherwise of the secure tenancy should not be brought into the valuation exercise mandated by section 28.
Briggs LJ in his judgment under appeal.
He said in para 28: Mr Loveridges rights of occupation had, from the very grant of his secure tenancy, been vulnerable to being downgraded on a sale by his local authority landlord to a private landlord.
It was a vulnerability inherent in the nature of his rights.
The Lord Justice rightly put aside the extreme unreality of any such proposed sale.
But he endorsed a valuation under section 28(1)(a) which was based upon a notional downgrading of the right which Mr Loveridge had prior to the eviction, namely the right of a secure tenant, so as to become the right only of an assured tenant.
In my view his endorsement was wrong: for, as His Honour Judge Blunsdon had concluded in a judgment of enviable clarity, section 28(1)(a) requires the basis of the valuation to be that Mr Loveridge continues following the eviction to have the same right to occupy as he had prior to the eviction.
I therefore propose that the appeal should be allowed and the judges order restored. 30.
Parliament might wish to revisit the application of section 27, and therefore of section 28, of the 1988 Act to unlawful evictions on the part of local authorities.
No doubt all reasonable means of dissuading them from making unlawful evictions, whether by misjudgement or otherwise, should be in place.
But the facts are that Lambeth did not realise a capital gain, and never aspired to realise a capital gain, as a result of its eviction of Mr Loveridge; and that its intention was always to re let the flat and that, once it did so, even its notional gain was eliminated.
In such circumstances it seems wrong that, by reference to a calculation of its notional gain, the law should require payment to Mr Loveridge out of public funds in an amount which is 12 times greater than that of his loss. 29.
Nobody could have put Lambeths argument more persuasively than did
","Section 28 of the Housing Act 1988 The Housing Act 1988 (the 1988 Act) was brought in with a view to stimulating the availability of rented accommodation in the private sector; it allowed landlords to let new tenancies on terms more advantageous to themselves [4].
Parliament included safeguards to deter unscrupulous landlords from evicting existing tenants with protected tenancies [15].
Section 27 of the 1988 Act provides the right to claim damages for unlawful eviction [6].
Section 28 sets out the method by which such damages are calculated, being the difference in value between two alternative calculations of the landlords interest in the building at the time immediately prior to the unlawful eviction: (1) The basis for the assessment of damages [for unlawful eviction] is the difference in value, determined as at the time immediately before the residential occupier ceased to occupy the premises in question as his residence, between (a) the value of the interest of the landlord in default determined on the assumption that the residential occupier continues to have the same right to occupy the premises as before that time; and (b) the value of that interest determined on the assumption that the residential occupier has ceased to have that right. (2) In relation to any premises, any reference in this section to the interest of the landlord in default is a reference to his interest in the building in which the premises in question are comprised (whether or not that building contains any other premises) together with its curtilage. (3) For the purposes of the valuations referred to in subsection (1) above, it shall be assumed (a) that the landlord in default is selling his interest on the open market to a willing buyer Mr Loveridges flat at 19 Moresby Walk From November 2002 Mr Loveridge lived in the downstairs flat at 19 Moresby Walk, a two storey house.
Both his flat and the upstairs flat were owned by the London Borough of Lambeth (Lambeth) and let under secure tenancies conferring certain statutory protections.
From July to December 2009 Mr Loveridge made a trip to Ghana.
While he was away, Lambeth changed the locks on his flat and cleared his possessions, mistakenly believing that he had died.
Two days after he returned to the UK, his flat was rented to somebody else [2].
Mr Loveridge sued Lambeth for damages.
The parties approaches to damages under section 28 Mr Loveridge and Lambeth each instructed a surveyor to value Lambeths interest in 19 Moresby Walk for the purposes of subsections 28(1)(a) and (b).
Mr Loveridges surveyor calculated valuation (a) on the basis that 19 Moresby Walk was sold with both the upstairs and downstairs flats subject to secure tenancies.
He calculated valuation (b) on the basis that 19 Moresby Walk was sold with vacant possession of the downstairs flat but with the upstairs flat subject to a secure tenancy.
The difference in value was 90,500 [22].
Lambeth adopted a different approach.
It relied on subsection 28(3)(a), which requires both valuations (a) and (b) to be calculated on the assumption that the property is sold on the open market to a willing buyer [18].
If 19 Moresby Walk had in fact been sold on the open market, say to a private landlord, the secure tenancies (which do not apply to private landlords) would have been converted into assured tenancies, thus allowing the new landlord to bring the rents up to market level [20].
Lambeths surveyor therefore conducted valuation (a) on the basis that both flats were subject to assured tenancies.
He concluded that valuation (b) produced the same figure as valuation (a) because the downstairs flat with vacant possession would be worth the same as if it were subject to an assured tenancy [23].
The procedural history At the hearing in the Lambeth County Court, the judge found that Mr Loveridge had been unlawfully evicted.
He preferred Mr Loveridges approach to the section 28 valuation exercise.
On 25 September 2012 he awarded Mr Loveridge90,500 under section 28 and 9,000 at common law in respect of the trespass to his goods [2].
Lambeth appealed against the quantum of damages.
The Court of Appeal accepted Lambeths argument and 10 May 2013 set aside the section 28 award [1].
It ordered Lambeth to pay 7,400 in damages at common law for unlawfully evicting Mr Loveridge, and, as before, 9,000 for trespass to goods.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores HHJ Blunsdons order for damages.
Lord Wilson (with whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwath and Lord Toulson agree) gives the judgment.
The words of section 27 of the 1988 Act are wide enough to cover local authority landlords as well as public landlords, even though local authority landlords rarely perpetrate unlawful evictions of their tenants [15].
Section 28(1) requires the court to make two valuations, namely (a) and (b), of the landlords interest [16].
Valuation (a) is based on the assumption that the tenant continues to have the same right to occupy the premises, and the landlord continues to be subject to the same restrictions on recovering possession, as before the eviction occurred.
Valuation (b) is based on the assumption that the tenants right to occupy and the restrictions on recovering possession have ceased [17].
The issue in this case was whether the valuation of both the upstairs and downstairs flats at 19 Moresby Walk (for valuation (a)) and of the upstairs flat (for valuation (b)) should be conducted on the assumption that they were subject to secure tenancies or to assured tenancies [24].
The assumption of a sale on the open market (subsection 28(3)(a)) is for the purposes of the valuations at subsection 28(1), in which other assumptions are mandated, namely (a) that the tenant continues to have the same right to occupy the premises as he had immediately prior to the eviction and, alternatively, (b) that he has ceased to have that right [26].
Prior to eviction, Mr Loveridges right to occupy the downstairs flat was that of a secure tenant.
The notional exercise required by subsection 28(3)(a) does not extend to making adjustments to the nature of the tenants rights that are consequent upon sale.
Such adjustments are barred by subsection 28(1)(a) which stipulates that the same right continues [27].
The likely effect upon a secure tenancy of a sale to a private landlord should not therefore be taken into account [28].

Mr Patrick McKenna is a former senior partner of a global firm of chartered accountants.
He is the founder and chief executive officer of Ingenious Media Holdings plc.
The company and its subsidiaries (collectively Ingenious Media) are an investment and advisory group specialising in the media and entertainment industries.
Among other things they have promoted film investment schemes involving film production partnerships.
The schemes were devised by Mr McKenna and utilised certain tax relief which was then available.
The marketing of the schemes stopped when the tax relief ceased to be available.
On 14 June 2012 the Permanent Secretary for Tax in HMRC, Mr David Hartnett, gave an interview to two financial journalists from The Times.
They had requested the meeting to discuss tax avoidance.
The meeting was recorded and was agreed to be off the record.
On 21 June 2012 The Times published two articles on the subject of film schemes and tax avoidance.
They informed readers that: Patrick McKenna and [X] are the two main providers of film investments schemes in the UK.
To the Revenue the two men represent a threat.
HM Revenue and Customs believes that film schemes have enabled investors to avoid at least 5 billion in tax.
Much of that sum, the Revenue says, is attached to schemes created by [X] or Mr McKenna.
Mr McKenna, 56, founder of Ingenious Media, is also involved in a long running Revenue inquiry into three of his partnerships.
Hes never left my radar, a senior Revenue official said of Mr McKenna.
Hes an urbane man, , hes a clever guy, hes made a fortune, hes a banker, but actually hes a big risk for us so we would like to recover lots of the tax relief hes generated for himself and other people.
Are we winning? I would say, beginning to.
I think well clean up on film schemes over the next few years.
The senior Revenue official was Mr Hartnett.
The words attributed to him are a direct quotation from the transcript of the interview, and Mr Hartnett was the source of the reference to 5 billion (although in the interview Mr Hartnett gave the figure utterly off the record).
Mr Hartnett said other things which were not for quotation (and were not quoted), including a description of the film schemes as scams for scumbags.
At the time of the interview, HMRC had not reached a formal decision whether to challenge their validity.
There is no dispute that Mr Hartnett imparted information to The Times regarding the tax activities of Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media, and HMRCs attitude towards them, derived from information held by HMRC about them.
Mr Hartnetts reasons for disclosure
The reasons given by Mr Hartnett for what he said to the journalists about Mr McKenna and Ingenious were that it was generally in HMRCs interests to try to establish good relations with the financial press; that they provided a way of emphasising to the general public HMRCs views on elaborate tax avoidance schemes; and that Mr Hartnett thought that the journalists might have information of significant value to HMRC, which they might reveal as the dialogue continued, such as details of tax avoidance arrangements which the journalists had uncovered but were unknown to HMRC.
Mr Hartnett emphasised that the interview was agreed to be off the record, and that he did not anticipate that his comments about Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media would be published.
The claim
The claim by Ingenious Media and Mr McKenna was brought by way of an application for judicial review, although in substance it was a straightforward claim for breach of a duty of confidentiality.
The form in which the claim was brought appears to have influenced its perception by the courts below.
At first instance, Sales J held that it was not appropriate for the court to approach Mr Hartnetts decision to say what he said as if the court were the primary decision maker: [2013] EWHC 3258 (Admin), para 40.
The court, he held, could only intervene if satisfied that Mr Hartnett could not rationally take the view that speaking to the journalists as he did would assist HMRC in the exercise of its tax collection functions.
Sales J emphasised, at para 50, that the rationality standard is a flexible one, which varies in the width of discretion allowed to a decision maker according to the strength of the public interest and the strength of the interests of any individual affected by the decision to be taken.
He laid stress on the fact that the disclosures made were limited and that the interview was agreed to be off the record.
The disclosures made were, in his judgment, not irrational, were made for a legitimate purpose and were proportionate.
In short, he approached the matter as a review on public law principles of an administrative act, and he dismissed the claim.
Sales Js judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a judgment given by Sir Robin Jacob, with which Moore Bick and Tomlinson LJJ agreed: [2015] 1 WLR 3183.
Sir Robin rejected the claimants arguments that the disclosures made were not in connection with a function of HMRC, properly construed, and that the judge had adopted the wrong standard of review.
As to the first argument, he held that a wide meaning should be given to section 18(2)(a)(i) ( subsection (1) does not apply to a disclosure which is made for the purposes of a function of the Revenue and Customs).
As to the second argument, Sir Robin echoed Sales Js holding that it was not for the court to review all the facts de novo as though it were the primary decision maker (para 46).
Analysis
From the judgments below and the arguments in this court, three main issues emerge: what is the proper construction of the section 18(2)(a)(i) read with the other provisions of the Act; what is the proper approach of the court in judging the conduct of Mr Hartnett; and what is the significance of his understanding that his interview with the journalists was to be off the record?
The interpretation of section 18
Unfortunately the courts below were not referred (or were only scarcely referred) to the common law of confidentiality.
The duty of confidentiality owed by HMRC to individual taxpayers is not something which sprang fresh from the mind of the legislative drafter.
It is a well established principle of the law of confidentiality that where information of a personal or confidential nature is obtained or received in the exercise of a legal power or in furtherance of a public duty, the recipient will in general owe a duty to the person from whom it was received or to whom it relates not to use it for other purposes.
The principle is sometimes referred to as the Marcel principle, after Marcel v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1992] Ch 225.
In relation to taxpayers, HMRCs entitlement to receive and hold confidential information about a person or a companys financial affairs is for the purpose of enabling it to assess and collect (or pay) what is properly due from (or to) the tax payer.
In R v Inland Revenue Comrs, Ex p National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses Ltd [1982] AC 617, 633, Lord Wilberforce said that the whole system involves that matters relating to income tax are between the commissioners and the taxpayer concerned, and that the total confidentiality of assessments and of negotiations between individuals and the revenue is a vital element in the working of the system.
See also Conway v Rimmer [1968] AC 910, 946 (Lord Reid); and R v Inland Revenue Comrs, Ex p Preston [1985] AC 835, 864F (Lord Templeman).
The Marcel principle may be overridden by explicit statutory provisions.
In In re Arrows Ltd (No 4) [1995] 2 AC 75, 102, Lord Browne Wilkinson said: In my view, where information has been obtained under statutory powers the duty of confidence owed on the Marcel principle cannot operate so as to prevent the person obtaining the information from disclosing it to those persons to whom the statutory provisions either require or authorise him to make disclosure.
Subsections (2)(b) et seq of section 18 contain specific provisions permitting the disclosure of taxpayer information for various purposes other than HMRCs primary function of revenue collection and management.
What then is the proper interpretation of the far broader words of subsection (2)(a)(i) disclosure made for the purposes of a function of HMRC? On HMRCs interpretation, it would be hard to conceive a wider expression.
By taking sections 5, 9 and 51(2) in combination, it is said to include anything which in the view of HMRC is necessary or expedient or incidental or conducive to or in connection with the exercise of the functions of the collection and management of revenue.
If that is the right interpretation of subsection (2)(a)(i), it means that a number of the subsequently listed specific exceptions are otiose, including (c) and (d), which deal with disclosure for the purposes of civil or criminal proceedings relating to matters connected with customs and excise.
Secondly, and more fundamentally, it means that the protection which would otherwise have been provided to the taxpayer by HMRCs duty of confidentiality will have been very significantly eroded by words of the utmost vagueness.
So to construe the words would run counter to the principle of construction known as the principle of legality, after Lord Hoffmanns use of the term in R v Secretary of State for the Home Office, Ex p Simms [2000] 2 AC 115, 131.
He explained the principle as follows: Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words.
This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process.
In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.
Lord Hoffmann said that this presumption will apply even to the most general words, but I would say further that the more general the words, the harder it is likely to be to rebut the presumption.
A similar principle can be seen in the courts approach to the interpretation of powers delegated under a so called Henry VIII clause.
In R (Public Law Project) v Lord Chancellor [2016] 3 WLR 387, para 26, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury PSC, with the agreement of the other members of the court, cited with approval the following passage in Craies on Legislation, 10th ed (2012), edited by Daniel Greenberg, at para 1.3.11: as with all delegated powers the only rule for construction is to test each proposed exercise by reference to whether or not it is within the class of action that Parliament must have contemplated when delegating.
Although Henry VIII powers are often cast in very wide terms, the more general the words used by Parliament to delegate a power, the more likely it is that an exercise within the literal meaning of the words will nevertheless be outside the legislatures contemplation. (Emphasis added)
To take the present case, the general principle of HMRCs duty of confidentiality regarding individual tax payers affairs is long established. (In 2011 Mr Hartnett articulated it when refusing to give any information to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee about tax payers with whom HMRC had reached settlements.) In passing the 2005 Act, Parliament cannot be supposed to have envisaged that by section 18(2)(a)(i) it was authorising HMRC officials to discuss its views of individual taxpayers in off the record discussions, whenever officials thought that this would be expedient for some collateral purpose connected with its functions, such as developing HMRCs relations with the press.
If Parliament really intended to delegate to officials such a wide discretion, limited only by a rationality test, in place of the ordinary principles of confidentiality applicable to public bodies in respect of confidential or private information obtained under statutory powers or for a statutory purpose, it would have significantly emasculated the primary duty of confidentiality recognised in section 18(1).
For those reasons section 18(2)(a)(i) requires to be interpreted more narrowly.
I take section 18(1) to be intended to reflect the ordinary principle of taxpayer confidentiality referred to in para 17, to which section 18(2)(a)(i) creates an exception by permitting disclosure to the extent reasonably necessary for HMRC to fulfil its primary function.
It was argued by HMRC that despite being headed Confidentiality, section 18 is not confined to information which is in any real sense confidential, but is far wider in its scope.
Therefore, it was argued, the exception contained in subsection (2)(a)(i) must be given a similarly expansive interpretation in order to avoid absurdity.
In support of this argument HMRC relied on the wording of section 19, which makes it a criminal offence for an official to disclose revenue or customs information relating to an identifiable person, but provides a defence if the person charged proves that he reasonably believed that the information had already and lawfully been made available to the public.
The creation of this defence showed, in HMRCs submission, that section 18 was not essentially or only about protecting confidentiality, because it self evidently extended to the disclosure of information which was already in the public domain.
This argument found favour with the Court of Appeal, but I do not consider that it bears the weight which HMRC seeks to put on it.
The argument is too subtle, and it is open to other objections.
It is well settled that information may be available to the public and yet not sufficiently widely known for all confidentiality in it to be destroyed.
As Eady J put it in McKennitt v Ash [2006] EMLR 10, para 81, where information has been obtained in circumstances giving rise to a duty of confidentiality, the protection of the law will not be withdrawn unless and until it is clear that a stage has been reached where there is no longer anything left to be protected.
Whether that stage has been reached may be a hard question on which reasonable people may disagree.
It is a fallacy to suppose that because a defence to a criminal charge under section 19 is available to a person who reasonably believed the information to be available to the public, it must follow that Parliament intended section 18 to prohibit the disclosure of information of the most ordinary kind about which there could be no possible confidentiality.
Moreover, even if section 18(1) has the wide scope suggested by HMRC (which it is not necessary to decide in this case), it does not follow that Parliament must be taken to have intended by subsection (2)(a)(i) to confer on officials a wide ranging discretion to disclose confidential information about the affairs of individual taxpayers.
The courts approach to review of HMRCs conduct
Ordinarily it is a matter for the court to decide the question whether there has been a breach of a duty of confidentiality, applying established principles of law to its own judgment of the facts.
Among other authorities, the point is well illustrated by the decision of the Court of Appeal in W v Egdell [1990] 1 Ch 359.
The plaintiff was detained in a secure mental hospital, under a hospital order coupled with a restriction order, after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The defendant, a consultant psychiatrist, was engaged on his behalf to prepare a report in connection with an intended application to a mental health review tribunal for his discharge.
The defendants report presented a disturbing picture and it led to the withdrawal of the application.
The defendant was nevertheless so concerned that matters in his report ought to be known to those responsible for the plaintiffs care and discharge that he sent a copy of it to the medical director at the hospital, with a view to its onward transmission to the Home Office.
The plaintiff sued the defendant for breach of his contractual duty of confidence.
Dismissing the action, the trial judge held that the doctors duty of confidentiality did not bar him from disclosing the report to the hospital if the doctor judged the report to be relevant to his care, nor from disclosing it to the Home Secretary if the doctor judged the report to be relevant to the exercise of the Home Secretarys discretionary powers.
The Court of Appeal upheld the judges decision but not his approach.
Bingham LJ said, at p 422, that the answer to the question whether the doctors disclosure was justified must turn not on what the doctor thinks but on what the court rules.
He added that it did not follow that the doctors conclusion was irrelevant; in making its ruling the court would give such weight to the doctors considered judgment as seemed in all the circumstances to be appropriate.
The same principle applies whether or not the duty of confidentiality is contractual.
It applies equally where the person or body owing a duty of confidentiality holds a public office or is a public body or is performing a public function, subject to any contrary statutory provision.
It is a cardinal error to suppose that the public law remedies and principles associated with judicial review of the exercise of administrative power, developed by the common law from the ancient prerogative writs, occupy the entire field whenever the party whose conduct is under challenge holds a public position.
It is important to emphasise that public bodies are not immune from the ordinary application of the common law, including in this case the law of confidentiality.
The common law is multi faceted and remains the bedrock of the English legal system.
Having rejected the view that section 18(2)(a)(i) should be interpreted as making the disclosure of information about individual taxpayers a matter for the discretion of HMRC officials, subject only to a rationality control, I disagree with the view of the lower courts that it was not for them to approach the disclosures made by Mr Hartnett as if they were primary decision makers.
In accordance with ordinary principles, the question of breach of confidentiality is one for the courts judgment.
Off the record
Off the record is an idiom and like many idioms can bear different shades of meaning.
It may, for example, be intended to mean strictly confidential or it may be intended to mean not to be directly quoted or attributed.
The judge found that Mr Hartnett understood it to mean that the interview was to be a background briefing, intended to influence the journalists views and what they wrote about matters affecting HMRC but not to be published.
There has been no appeal against that finding, but nothing in my view turns on what precisely Mr Hartnett intended.
As a matter of principle, a disclosure of confidential information may sometimes be permissible on a restricted basis. (In the case of W v Egdell, previously cited, the doctor was lawfully justified in passing on his report to those who had responsibility for the plaintiffs care, whereas it would not have been lawful to pass it to someone who had no such responsibility.) But an impermissible disclosure of confidential information is no less impermissible just because the information is passed on in confidence; every schoolchild knows that this is how secrets get passed on.
The references by the courts below to the nature of the interview leave me in some doubt whether they had a clear regard for the distinction.
Conclusion
The information supplied by Mr Hartnett to the journalists about Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media was information of a confidential nature, in respect of which HMRC owed a duty of confidentiality to them under section 18(1).
It was limited in scope, but it was not insignificant, as is evident from the use made of it in the articles which followed the interview.
At the time of the interview the tax consequences of the film schemes discussed in it were under consideration by HMRC.
The schemes themselves were things of the past.
It is not suggested that the disclosures made by Mr Hartnett were reasonably necessary for the purpose of HMRCs investigations into the schemes.
As to the justifications put forward by HMRC, a general desire to foster good relations with the media or to publicise HMRCs views about elaborate tax avoidance schemes cannot possibly justify a senior or any other official of HMRC discussing the affairs of individual tax payers with journalists.
The further suggestion that the conversation might have led to the journalists telling Mr Hartnett about other tax avoidance schemes, of which HMRC knew nothing, appears to have been no more than speculation, and is far too tenuous to justify giving confidential information to them.
The fact that Mr Hartnett did not anticipate his comments being reported is in itself no justification for making them.
The whole idea of HMRC officials supplying confidential information about individuals to the media on a non attributable basis is, or should be, a matter of serious concern.
I would not seek to lay down a rule that it can never be justified, because never say never is a generally sound maxim.
It is possible, for example, to imagine a case where HMRC officials might be engaged in an anti smuggling operation which might be in danger of being wrecked by journalistic investigations and where for operational reasons HMRC might judge it necessary to take the press into its confidence, but such cases should be exceptional.
I would reject the argument that the disclosure was justified under section 18(2)(a), allow the appeal and invite the parties written submissions as to the appropriate form of order.
","This case concerns the scope of the duty of confidentiality owed by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in respect of the affairs of taxpayers.
This duty is set out in statutory form in Section 18(1) of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 (the 2005 Act), which provides that HMRC officials may not disclose taxpayer information.
Section 18(2) of the 2005 Act sets out a number of situations in which this duty may be overridden.
These include where a disclosure is made for the purposes of a function of HMRC (s.18(2)(a)(i)) and function is given a broad and general definition in various sections.
There are also a number of more specific situations set out in ss.18(2)(b) to (j), such as for the purposes of civil or criminal proceedings.
Mr Patrick McKenna is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ingenious Media Holdings plc (Ingenious Media), an investment and advisory group specialising in the media and entertainment industries.
It promoted film and investment schemes involving film production partnerships which utilised certain tax relief previously available [8].
On 14 June 2012 the Permanent Secretary for tax in HMRC, Mr David Hartnett, gave an off the record interview to two financial journalists from The Times about tax avoidance [9].
On 21 June 2012 The Times published two articles on film schemes and tax avoidance which identified Mr McKenna as one of two main providers of film investment schemes in the UK and informed readers that such schemes had enabled investors to avoid at least 5 million in tax a figure that had been provided by Mr Hartnett.
The articles also contained a direct quote from the interview with Mr Hartnett about Mr McKenna, which was attributed to a senior Revenue official [10 11].
Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media brought a claim for judicial review of the decision of HMRC, acting by way of Mr Hartnett, to disclose information which concerned them to The Times journalists.
The court at first instance held that it should not approach the disclosures as if it were the primary decision maker.
It found that the disclosures made by Mr Hartnett were not irrational, were made for a legitimate purpose and were proportional [14].
This approach was upheld by the Court of Appeal [15].
Ingenious Media Holdings appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows Ingenious Medias appeal.
Lord Toulson, with whom the other Justices agree, gives the lead judgment.
Judicial review is not the only course of action available to challenge the conduct of a public body.
Public bodies are not immune from the ordinary application of the common law, including the law of
confidentiality [28].
This case should be approached from the perspective of the common law of confidentiality [17, 28].
It is a well established principle of the law of confidentiality that where information of a personal or confidential nature is obtained or received in the exercise of a legal power or in furtherance of a public duty, the recipient will in general owe a duty to the person from whom the information was received or it relates.
The tax affairs of individual taxpayers are matters between HMRC and the taxpayer, and confidentiality is a vital element in the working of the system [17].
However, this principle may be overridden by explicit statutory provisions [18].
By taking together ss.5, 9 and 51(2) of the 2005 Act, HMRCs interpretation of the phrase disclosure made for the purpose of a function of HMRC in s.18(2)(a)(i), would permit disclosure of anything which in the view of HMRC is necessary, expedient, incidental, conducive to or in connection with the exercise of the functions of the collection and management of revenue.
However, if this interpretation was correct the provisions permitting disclosure in the specific circumstances in s.18(2)(b) to (j) would be superfluous.
Furthermore, such a construction would run counter to the principle of legality, by which fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words [19].
In enacting the 2005 Act, Parliament cannot have envisaged that it was authorising HMRC officials such a wide ranging discretion to disclose confidential information about the affairs of individual taxpayers, limited only by the rationality test applied in judicial review claims, as this would significantly undermine the primary duty of confidentiality in s.18(1) [22].
The correct interpretation of Section 18(2)(a)(i) is that it permits disclosure to the extent reasonably necessary for HMRC to fulfil its primary function [23].
It is for the court to decide whether there has been a breach of confidentiality by applying the law to its own judgment of the facts.
The opinion of the individual who has disclosed the information is not irrelevant, but the court will decide what weight it should be given [26].
This principle applies whether the duty of confidentiality is contractual or where, as in the current case, the person or body owing a duty of confidentiality holds a public office, is a public body, or is performing a public function, subject to any contrary statutory provision [27, 29].
An impermissible disclosure of confidential information is no less impermissible because the information is passed on in confidence, or off the record [31].
The information supplied by Mr Hartnett to the journalists about Mr McKenna and Ingenious Media was confidential in nature, in respect of which HMRC owed a duty of confidentiality under s.18(1) of the 2005 Act [32].
The fact that Mr Hartnett did not anticipate his comments being reported is not a justification for making them [35].
The desire to foster good relations with the media and to publicise HMRCs view about tax avoidance schemes and speculation that the journalists may have subsequently informed Mr Hartnett about other tax avoidance schemes do not provide sufficient justification for the disclosures either [34].
The disclosures by Mr Hartnett were not therefore justified under s.18(2)(a) of the 2005 Act [36].

Representative Members of the scheme
Janet Forrest
Malcolm Dick LORD HODGE: (with whom Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lord Sumption and Lord Briggs agree) 1.
This appeal raises a question of interpretation of a clause in a pension scheme trust deed which defines the phrase Retail Prices Index and which allows the trustees of the pension scheme to adopt a replacement of the officially published Retail Prices Index (the RPI). 2.
The background is the recognised need for private pension schemes to provide some form of indexation of pensions to protect the value of members pensions against price inflation.
As discussed below, the question is whether the clause allows the pension scheme trustees to adopt an index of price inflation, such as the Consumer Prices Index (the CPI), when the official body responsible for compiling the RPI (now the Office of National Statistics) has not discontinued the RPI, thereby requiring its replacement. 3.
Barnardos, the well known charity who is the sponsoring employer, argues that the clause empowers the trustees to adopt another index which they consider a suitable measure of price inflation, whether or not the RPI continues to be published.
Barnardos see the CPI as a more appropriate measure of inflation which will also enable a reduction of the schemes deficit.
Representatives of the members of the scheme, who are concerned that the adoption of the CPI as the index would over time reduce the benefits which they receive from the scheme, argue that the clause does not empower the trustees to depart from the RPI for the purposes of indexation if the RPI continues to be published.
The trustees adopt a neutral stance on the question.
The Barnardo Staff Pension Scheme 4.
In 1984 Barnardos adopted a staff pension scheme which took effect from 1978.
In 1991 Barnardos adopted a new pension scheme which took effect from 1 April 1988 and completely superseded the 1978 scheme.
The 1988 rules have subsequently been amended and adopted with effect from 2001, 2004 and 2007.
But the relevant provisions of the current rules are in substance the same as those in the 1988 rules, to which counsel referred in their submissions.
I therefore set out the relevant provisions from the 1988 rules. 5.
Rule 7 of the scheme gave members a pension of 1/60th of their final pensionable earnings for each complete year of pensionable service.
Rule 30 provided for pensions in the course of payment to be increased by the prescribed rate.
Rule 30.1.3 provided: For the purpose of this rule 30 the prescribed rate means an increase at the rate of the lesser of: (a) 5%, and (b) the percentage rise in the Retail Prices Index (if any) over the year ending on the previous 31 December. 6.
Rule 53, which contains a definition of Retail Prices Index lies at the heart of the dispute.
An important part of the argument concerns the relationship between the first and second sentences of the definition.
In order to assist comprehension I present the definition in a disaggregated manner, adding (i) and (ii) before each sentence, although the text of the definition is simply an undifferentiated paragraph, and highlighting in italics the critical part of the definition.
The rule 53 definition (the Definition) is as follows: Retail Prices Index (i) means the General Index of Retail Prices published by the Department of Employment or any replacement adopted by the Trustees without prejudicing Approval. (ii) Where an amount is to be increased in line with the Retail Prices Index over a period, the increase as a percentage of the original amount will be equal to the percentage increase between the figures in the Retail Prices Index published immediately prior to dates when the period began and ended, with an appropriate restatement of the later figure if the Retail Prices Index has been replaced or re based during the period. 7.
The Appendix to the Rules of the 1988 rules contains a summary of the rules by which the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (the CIR) then imposed limits on the benefits which a private pension scheme could confer if it were to obtain the approval to which I refer in para 8 below.
The basic limit for a pension of a member who retired at or before the normal retirement date was 1/60th of the final remuneration for each year of service.
In several places in the Appendix the text referred to the indexation of benefits in line with RPI.
Thus, for example, in para 6 it was stated that the maximum pension may be increased whilst in payment at 3% per year compound or (if greater) in line with RPI.
In para 10 the Appendix defined the phrase in these terms: in line with RPI over a period means in proportion to increases between figures in the General Index of Retail Prices published by the Department of Employment (or a replacement of that Index not prejudicing Approval), immediately prior to the dates when the period began and ended with appropriate restatement of the later figure if the Index has been replaced or re based during the period. 8.
The reference to Approval in the Rules and in the Appendix was a reference to the discretionary approval of the scheme by the CIR as an exempt approved scheme under Chapter 1 of Part XIV of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The definitions of Tax Approval in the Rules and of Approval in the Appendix were to this effect. 9.
Lewison LJ in the Court of Appeal (para 6) neatly summarised the principal question in the appeal in this way: The critical words in the definition of the RPI are or any replacement adopted by the Trustees without prejudicing Approval.
Does the definition mean: the RPI or any index that replaces the RPI and is (i) adopted by the trustees; or (ii) trustees as a replacement for the RPI?
the RPI or any index that is adopted by the
The first meaning involves a two stage process by which the RPI is replaced by an official body responsible for its publication and the trustees then adopt the replacement or one of several indices produced as replacements.
The second meaning, which Barnardos advances, involves a single step and would allow the trustees to choose another index as a replacement of the RPI, whether or not the RPI continued to be published.
The decisions of the courts and the appellants challenge
The trustees of the pension scheme sought a ruling on the meaning of the Definition by a claim under Part 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules.
In a judgment ([2015] EWHC 2200 (Ch); [2015] Pens LR 501) Warren J held that, on a proper construction, the Definition did not empower the trustees to adopt an index other than the RPI unless the RPI had been discontinued as an officially published index and replaced.
The Court of Appeal by majority (Lewison and McFarlane LJJ, Vos LJ dissenting) dismissed Barnardos appeal.
Barnardos sought permission to appeal.
This court gave permission to appeal on the understanding that there might be clauses in many pension schemes which contained similar wording.
But it is not clear whether that is so.
Mr Brian Green QC presented the case on behalf of Barnardos.
I mean no disrespect to his elegant submissions if I summarise them briefly.
First, he explained that the scheme had been subject to the CIRs discretionary approval.
He referred to the CIR guidance known as IR 12 (1979) which set out the limits on the benefits which the CIR allowed.
The arrangement for CIR approval was superseded by the Finance Act 2004 but the requirement for that approval explained the repeated reference in the scheme, including in the definition of RPI in rule 53, to Approval.
Mr Green submitted that the first sentence of the Definition fell to be construed as RPI or any alternative adopted by the trustees.
The phrase, he submitted, contained pointers which supported his interpretation.
It was not disputed that the trustees had to exercise discretion in deciding to adopt a replacement.
There might be no room for the exercise of discretion if the official body which published the RPI replaced it with another index.
Similarly, the requirement that the adopted replacement did not prejudice CIR approval pointed to a circumstance where there was a possibility that the trustees choice of replacement might not receive CIR approval.
That eventuality was very unlikely if the clause operated only when the RPI was replaced by another official index.
He also submitted that it was inherently improbable in 1991 that the Government would discontinue the RPI.
While recognising that the second sentence of the Definition also referred to replaced, he submitted that that sentence was of no relevance to a proper understanding of the first sentence as it referred to the phrase, in line with the Retail Prices Index, which did not appear in the Rules but only in the Appendix.
Replacement in sentence 1 did not necessarily have the same meaning as replaced in sentence 2.
Discussion
The construction of pension schemes
In the trilogy of cases, Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank [2011] 1 WLR 2900, Arnold v Britton [2015] AC 1619 and Wood v Capita Insurance Services Ltd [2017] AC 1173, this court has given guidance on the general approach to the construction of contracts and other instruments, drawing on modern case law of the House of Lords since Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381.
That guidance, which the parties did not contest in this appeal, does not need to be repeated.
In deciding which interpretative tools will best assist in ascertaining the meaning of an instrument, and the weight to be given to each of the relevant interpretative tools, the court must have regard to the nature and circumstances of the particular instrument.
A pension scheme, such as the one in issue on this appeal, has several distinctive characteristics which are relevant to the courts selection of the appropriate interpretative tools.
First, it is a formal legal document which has been prepared by skilled and specialist legal draftsmen.
Secondly, unlike many commercial contracts, it is not the product of commercial negotiation between parties who may have conflicting interests and who may conclude their agreement under considerable pressure of time, leaving loose ends to be sorted out in future.
Thirdly, it is an instrument which is designed to operate in the long term, defining peoples rights long after the economic and other circumstances, which existed at the time when it was signed, may have ceased to exist.
Fourthly, the scheme confers important rights on parties, the members of the pension scheme, who were not parties to the instrument and who may have joined the scheme many years after it was initiated.
Fifthly, members of a pension scheme may not have easy access to expert legal advice or be able readily to ascertain the circumstances which existed when the scheme was established.
Judges have recognised that these characteristics make it appropriate for the court to give weight to textual analysis, by concentrating on the words which the draftsman has chosen to use and by attaching less weight to the background factual matrix than might be appropriate in certain commercial contracts: Spooner v British Telecommunications plc [2000] Pens LR 65, Jonathan Parker J at paras 75 76; BESTrustees v Stuart [2001] Pens LR 283, Neuberger J at para 33; Safeway Ltd v Newton [2018] Pens LR 2, Lord Briggs, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, at paras 21 23.
In Safeway, Lord Briggs stated (para 22): the Deed exists primarily for the benefit of non parties, that is the employees upon whom pension rights are conferred whether as members or potential members of the Scheme, and upon members of their families (for example in the event of their death).
It is therefore a context which is inherently antipathetic to the recognition, by way of departure from plain language, of some common understanding between the principal employer and the trustee, or common dictionary which they may have employed, or even some widespread practice within the pension industry which might illuminate, or give some strained meaning to, the words used.
I agree with that approach.
In this context I do not think that the court is assisted by assertions as to whether or not the pensions industry in 1991 could have foreseen or did foresee the criticisms of the suitability of the RPI, which later emerged in the public domain, or then thought that it was or was not likely that the RPI would be superseded.
The emphasis on textual analysis as an interpretative tool does not derogate from the need both to avoid undue technicality and to have regard to the practical consequences of any construction.
Such an analysis does not involve literalism but includes a purposive construction when that is appropriate.
As Millett J stated in In re Courage Groups Pension Schemes [1987] 1 WLR 495, 505 there are no special rules of construction applicable to a pension scheme but its provisions should wherever possible be construed to give reasonable and practical effect to the scheme.
Instead, the focus on textual analysis operates as a constraint on the contribution which background factual circumstances, which existed at the time when the scheme was entered into but which would not readily be accessible to its members as time passed, can make to the construction of the scheme.
It is nevertheless relevant to the construction of pension schemes that they are drafted to comply with tax rules so as to preserve the considerable benefits which the United Kingdoms tax regime confers on such schemes.
They must be construed against their fiscal backgrounds: National Grid Co plc v Mayes [2001] 1 WLR 864, para 18 per Lord Hoffmann; British Airways Pension Trustees Ltd v British Airways Plc [2002] Pens LR 247, Arden LJ at para 30.
In this case, the CIR guidance on approval of schemes, which is contained in the practice note on occupational pension schemes (IR 12 (1979)), forms part of the relevant background.
In the footnote to para 6.14 of that guidance, the CIR stated: Increases in the cost of living may be measured by the index of retail prices published by the Department of Employment or by any other suitable index agreed for the particular scheme by the Superannuation Funds Office.
It appears therefore that the CIR, in giving discretionary approval to a scheme, would not have objected to a scheme which empowered its trustees to substitute an appropriate index for the RPI.
This is relevant background as it means that there was no CIR constraint which might influence the construction of the words in dispute.
This contrasts with the National Grid case in which the fiscal background was directly relevant to the interpretation of a phrase in the scheme.
The tax regime did not allow an employer to be paid part of a surplus of scheme funds, which had already received tax exemptions when payments were made into the scheme.
But the tax regime did not prohibit the release of a debt due by the employer to the scheme which had not had those tax advantages.
This assisted the House of Lords to construe narrowly a provision in the scheme which prohibited the making of scheme moneys payable to the employers.
In the present case, as Lewison LJ stated at para 32 of his judgment, the draftsman of the scheme did not track the wording of the Revenue guidance in the Definition but chose different language.
The scheme could have empowered the trustees to select an index as an alternative to the RPI.
The question is whether it did so.
Finally, a focus on textual analysis in the context of the deed containing the scheme must not prevent the court from being alive to the possibility that the draftsman has made a mistake in the use of language or grammar which can be corrected by construction, as occurred in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] AC 1101, where the court can clearly identify both the mistake and the nature of the correction.
The construction of the Definition
I am persuaded that the judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal were right to conclude that the correct interpretation of the first sentence of the Definition is the first of the options to which Lewison LJ referred and which I have repeated in para 9 above, namely, that the RPI means the RPI or any index that replaces the RPI and is adopted by the trustees.
I reach this view for the following eight reasons.
First, the draftsman has chosen to use the word replacement which does not naturally suggest the selection of an alternative to an option which remains available.
It is, nonetheless, capable of bearing that meaning and one must look to the context for guidance.
Secondly, the word order and grammatical construction of the phrase a replacement adopted by the trustees suggest that the RPI must first be replaced and that the trustees adopt the replacement.
The word order suggests a sequence of events rather than the single event of an index being adopted by the trustees as a replacement.
Thirdly, the existence of a discretion on the part of the trustees and the requirement that the adoption should not prejudice the CIRs approval do not militate against this view.
In paras 15 20 of his judgment Lewison LJ usefully sets out the history of official cost of living indices in the United Kingdom which he derived from a report, UK Consumer Price Statistics: A Review, by Mr Paul Johnson, the Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which was prepared for the UK Statistics Authority in 2015.
There is no benefit in repeating that account in this judgment.
It suffices to say that there were several additional official price indices in 1991 when the 1988 rules were prepared, namely the state pensioner indices introduced in 1969, the Tax and Prices Index introduced in 1979 and the Rossi Index, which was introduced in 1981 and was used to uprate income related state benefits.
In 1981 the UK started to issue index linked gilts, using the RPI.
A cautious draftsman may well have chosen to provide for the eventuality of the RPI being replaced by more than one official index.
As a result the trustees would be required to exercise discretion in the selection of the appropriate replacement and the CIR themselves would have an interest in making sure that the chosen index was suitable when considering whether to approve the scheme.
Fourthly, it is trite both that a provision in a pension scheme or other formal document should be considered in the context of the document as a whole and that one would in principle expect words and phrases to be used consistently in a carefully drafted document, absent a reason for giving them different meanings.
In the second sentence of the Definition the draftsman has defined the phrase in line with the Retail Prices Index.
That sentence speaks of the RPI having been replaced or re based.
The re basing of the RPI involves the resetting of the starting point for measuring changes in prices to 100.
The authority responsible for publication of the RPI has re based the index from time to time.
It is not suggested that anyone other than the official body responsible for the index could re base it.
Other things being equal, I would expect that the draftsman of the phrase replaced or re based envisaged the same official body either replacing or re basing the index.
This is supported by the definition of the same phrase (albeit referring to RPI rather than Retail Prices Index) in the Appendix, which I have set out in para 7 above.
It is clear that the definition in the Appendix is referring to the replacement or re basing of the RPI by an official body responsible for the production of that index.
In the late 1980s the Central Statistical Office (CSO) took responsibility for the RPI and the CSO became part of the Office for National Statistics in 1996.
Consistency within the scheme as a whole, and indeed within the Definition itself would suggest that it is that official body and not the trustees who are to effect the replacement in the first sentence of the Definition.
Mr Green submitted that the court in construing the first sentence of the Definition should not attach any significant weight to the second sentence because it was defining an expression used only in the Appendix and it duplicated the definition in the Appendix in any event.
I do not agree.
Clause 3 of the Deed containing the rules of the scheme stated that the Scheme will be governed by the Rules (including the Appendix) contained in this deed, thereby clarifying that the Appendix was to be seen as part of the rules.
Further, rule 32, which prohibited the payment of benefits in excess of the CIR limits, referred to the Appendix as containing a summary of those limits.
The rules and the Appendix are intimately related.
While it is true that there was no need to include the second sentence of the Definition because of the definition of the same term in para 10 of the Appendix, its inclusion cannot be viewed as a mistake.
The second sentence forms part of the Definition and cannot be airbrushed out of it simply because there has been duplication.
Thus in construing the scheme as a whole the court must have regard to the use of the words replacement and replaced or re based in the same definitional rule and also the use of the latter words in the parallel definition in para 10 of the Appendix.
Fifthly, I do not derive any assistance from the CIR guidance in IR 12, because (as I have discussed in para 17 above) the draftsman has not chosen to use wording similar to that guidance in the Definition.
If there were any inconsistency between the terms of IR 12 on the one hand and the rules and Appendix of the Scheme on the other, the latter must prevail.
It may be that the draftsman thought that IR 12 was addressing the initial choice of index when a scheme was first established rather than an alteration of an index during the currency of the scheme.
But whether or not that is a correct inference, it cannot be doubted that he or she chose to use language in both the Definition and the Appendix which differed from IR 12.
Sixthly, I do not derive any real assistance from the superseded 1978 scheme, in which the term Index was defined in the introductory interpretation clause as: the Governments Index of Retail Prices or any other official cost of living index published by authority in place of or in substitution for that Index.
This definition can provide little assistance because the 1988 rules involved a wholesale re drafting of the earlier rules in which the draftsman may or may not have had regard to the wording of the earlier rules, with the result that there is no basis for assuming that the draftsmans use of different words points to an intention to achieve a different meaning.
In any event, I agree with Lewison LJ in para 23 of his judgment that the nature of a pension scheme, which may have members who have no knowledge of the prior rules, makes it unprofitable to delve into the archaeology of the rules in this case.
Seventhly, a provision which provided for the circumstance of the official replacement of a cost of living index does not lack a rational purpose.
The United Kingdom Government had changed its official index in 1946 and again in 1956 and, as I have said, had published additional indices by 1991 when the 1988 rules were drafted.
Whether or not it was likely that the Government might dispense with and replace the RPI, a cautious draftsman of a long term contract or trust such as the scheme might well provide for such an eventuality.
Commercial common sense therefore does not point against the interpretation to which a primarily textual analysis of the words points.
While, since 1991, the RPI has fallen from favour as an appropriate measure of the cost of living, it is not appropriate to use hindsight of such post execution events to assess whether a provision makes good commercial sense.
Eighthly, while the requirement of indexation by reference to the RPI imposes obligations on Barnardos and contributes to the pension deficit at a time when many see the CPI as a more reliable index for the cost of living, the court must construe the scheme without any preconceptions as to whether a construction should favour the sponsoring employer or the members: British Airways Pension Trustees (above), Arden LJ at para 31.
The sponsoring employers gain may be the members loss and vice versa.
Finally, I must address an argument which Vos LJ favoured and which contributed to the reasoning in his dissent.
That argument is that the provision would be inconveniently inflexible if the trustees were not able to switch to another index in the eventuality that the RPI ceased to be a suitable index for measuring the cost of living for pensioners but was not abolished because it was retained in existence for other purposes.
The proviso to rule 46 of the scheme prevents Barnardos from altering the scheme to the prejudice of any pension or annuity then payable under the scheme or any benefit already secured.
Thus, it was argued, common sense required the trustees to be vested with a power to change the index if the RPI ceased properly to reflect inflation in the cost of living.
But, while it may have been desirable to have that flexibility, the draftsman appears to have put his or her faith in the suitability of the officially produced index and not to have foreseen the circumstances in which the RPI ceased to be seen as an appropriate index for the cost of living.
Only by relying on hindsight can weight be given to this consideration; and that is not legitimate.
For these reasons, which are essentially the same as those which Lewison LJ gave in his impressive judgment, the appeal must fail.
As a result, it is not necessary to address the cross appeal on the subsisting rights provisions contained in sections 67 and 67A 67I of the Pensions Act 1995.
Conclusion
I would dismiss the appeal.
","There is a recognised need for private pension schemes to provide some form of indexation of pensions to protect the value of members pensions against price inflation.
To this end, Barnardos adopted a pension scheme which provides for pensions in the course of payment to be increased by the prescribed rate, which is defined as an increase at the rate of the lesser of: (a) 5%, and (b) the percentage rise in the Retail Prices Index (if any) over the year ending on the previous 31 December.
The definition of Retail Prices Index lies at the heart of the dispute: Retail Prices Index means the General Index of Retail Prices published by the Department of Employment or any replacement adopted by the Trustees without prejudicing Approval.
Where an amount is to be increased in line with the Retail Prices Index over a period, the increase as a percentage of the original amount will be equal to the percentage increase between the figures in the Retail Prices Index published immediately prior to dates when the period began and ended, with an appropriate restatement of the later figure if the Retail Prices Index has been replaced or re based during the period (the Definition).
The critical clause in the Definition is or any replacement adopted by the Trustees without prejudicing Approval.
Barnardos argues that this clause empowers the trustees to adopt another index which they consider a more suitable measure of price inflation (such as the Consumer Prices Index (the CPI)), regardless of whether or not the Retail Price Index (RPI) continues to be published.
Representatives of members of the scheme, who are concerned that the adoption of the CPI as the index would over time reduce benefits which they receive from the scheme, argue that the clause does not empower the trustees to depart from the RPI for the purposes of the indexation if the RPI continues to be published.
The trustees adopt a neutral stance.
The trustees sought a ruling on the meaning of the Definition.
The High Court held that, on a proper construction, the Definition did not empower the trustees to adopt an index other than the RPI unless the RPI had been discontinued as an officially published index and replaced.
Barnardos appealed this decision.
The Court of Appeal by majority (Lewison and McFarlane LLJ, Vos LJ dissenting) dismissed the appeal.
Barnardos appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Hodge gives the sole judgment with which the other Justices agree.
In deciding which interpretative tools will best assist in ascertaining the meaning of a contract or trust, and the weight to be given to each of the relevant interpretative tools, English courts must have regard to the nature and circumstances of the particular instrument [13].
A pension scheme has several distinctive characteristics which are relevant to the courts selection of the appropriate interpretative tools.
First, it is a formal legal document which has been prepared by skilled and specialist legal draftsmen.
Secondly, unlike many commercial contracts, it is not the product of commercial negotiation between parties who may have conflicting interests and who may conclude their agreement under considerable pressure of time.
Thirdly, it is an instrument which is designed to operate in the long term, defining peoples rights long after the economic and other circumstances, which existed at the time when it was signed, may have ceased to exist.
Fourthly, the scheme confers important rights on parties, the members of the pension scheme, who were not parties to the instrument and who may have joined the scheme many years after it was initiated.
Fifthly, members of a pension scheme may not have easy access to expert legal advice or be able readily to ascertain the circumstances which existed when the scheme was established [14].
In light of these characteristics, it is appropriate for the Court to give weight to textual analysis, by concentrating on the words which the draftsman has chosen to use and by attaching less weight to the background factual matrix than might be appropriate in certain commercial contracts [15].
However, the emphasis on textual analysis as an interpretative tool does not derogate from the need both to avoid undue technicality and to have regard to the practical consequences of any construction.
Such an analysis does not involve literalism but includes a purposive construction when that is appropriate [16].
The Court is persuaded that the correct interpretation of the first sentence of the Definition is that RPI means the RPI or any index that replaces the RPI and is adopted by the trustees [19].
The Court reaches this view for the following eight reasons.
First, the draftsman chose to use the word replacement which does not naturally suggest the selection of an alternative to an option which remains available.
It is, nonetheless, capable of bearing that meaning, and one must look to the context for guidance [20].
Secondly, the word order and grammatical construction of the phrase a replacement adopted by the trustees suggest that the RPI must first be replaced and that the trustees adopt the replacement. [21].
Thirdly, the existence of a discretion on the part of the trustees and the requirement that the adoption should not prejudice the approval of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (CIR) do not militate against this view [22].
Fourthly, consistency within the rules of the scheme as a whole, and indeed within the Definition itself, would suggest that it is the relevant official authority and not the trustees who are to effect the replacement in the first sentence of the Definition [23].
Fifthly, the CIR guidance on approval of schemes does not assist because the draftsman has not chosen to use wording similar to that guidance in the Definition [25].
Sixthly, the superseded rules do not assist in interpreting the Definition [26].
Seventhly, a provision which provides for the circumstance of the official replacement of a cost of living index does not lack a rational purpose [27].
Eighthly, while the requirement of indexation by reference to the RPI imposes obligations on Barnardos and contributes to the pension deficit at a time when many see the CPI as a more reliable index for the cost of living, the Court must construe the rules of the scheme without any preconceptions as to whether a construction should favour the sponsoring employer or the members [28].
"
uksc-2016-0052,"This case concerns the enforcement of confiscation orders made by the Crown Court upon conviction.
As well as various statutory mechanisms for enforcement via the appointment of receivers, successive confiscation statutes have adopted the scheme of making confiscation orders enforceable as if they were fines imposed by the Crown Court.
That involves using the powers of the Magistrates Court, which is the court which can, if payment is not made, issue a warrant committing the non paying defendant to prison.
When making the confiscation order (as when imposing a fine), the Crown Court is required by statute to fix a default term of imprisonment to be served if the defendant does not pay.
In a simple case of non payment, the magistrates will usually issue a warrant committing the defendant to prison for the period which the Crown Court fixed as the default term, and that term has to be served consecutively to any sentence passed for the substantive offences which led to the making of the confiscation order.
There are, however, two possible adjustments which may have to be considered.
The first is interest.
The second is part payment.
The present appeal concerns how these two adjustments fall to be made when they coincide.
Because the confiscation order made in this case, and the enforcement action taken in consequence, happened some time ago, this case falls to be decided upon legislation now repealed and replaced.
It is not, however, of merely historical interest.
Although the drafting of later legislation has not been identical, the issue raised by this appeal arises in much the same way under the current legislation, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
Put shortly, the issue is this.
If between the making of the confiscation order by the Crown Court and the issue of a warrant by the magistrates committing the defendant to prison, part payment has been made, but also interest has accrued, what does the statutory scheme say about how credit is to be given for the part payment? Is the term of imprisonment ordered by the magistrates to be reduced, by reason of the part payment, by reference to the total net sum outstanding (including interest), or is reduction for part payment to be calculated by reference only to the principal sum payable under the confiscation order? It is trite, but important, to say at the outset that the question is not what scheme might be thought desirable, but rather what the convoluted statutes actually mean.
It is also relevant to note that although the issue makes a difference of 11 days in the present case, in the context of a defendant sentenced originally to a term of 25 years for his substantive offences, it will apply to a large number of prisoners, and may fall for decision not only by courts, but also by prison governors who have to determine release dates.
The facts
Mr Gibson was convicted of drug trafficking offences on 21 May 1999 and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.
On 29 March 2000 at the confiscation hearing, he was ordered to pay a little over 5.4m; that meant that it had been determined by the judge that his benefit was not less than that sum and that he had assets from which that sum might be realised.
He was given 12 months to pay, and the judge fixed the term of six years imprisonment in default of payment.
Interest therefore ran from the expiry of the 12 months to pay.
He paid nothing until 4 May 2007, when 12,500 was paid, it would appear via a receiver appointed to realise his assets.
A month later, he appeared before the magistrates for consideration of a warrant of commitment.
The magistrates deducted seven days from the six year term in default, to take account of the recent part payment.
As at that time, interest had lifted the net sum outstanding, allowing for the part payment, to 8.1m.
Subsequently, later in 2007 and in 2011, two further realisations were achieved by his receiver, which produced payments of 12,500 and 65,370.
The prison authorities, and through them the Secretary of State for Justice, calculated the reduction in the six year default term on the basis of the proportion which these payments bore to the 8.1m outstanding at the time of his committal.
That produced reductions of three days and 21 days, totalling 24 days.
If the arithmetic had been applied instead to an outstanding figure confined to the original 5.4m, something like 11 extra days reduction would have been made.
The issue in the present appeal is whether he was entitled to those 11 extra days.
Interest on confiscation orders
Uniquely amongst orders for payment of money made by criminal courts, confiscation orders carry interest.
They have done so since the early 1990s: see section 15 of the Criminal Justice (International Co operation) Act 1990 and section 9 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1995, which introduced the rule respectively in relation to drugs offences and to other forms of crime.
Interest has been set, by successive statutes, at the same rate as is prescribed from time to time for civil judgment debts under section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838.
The interest provisions relevant to the present case were contained in section 10 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 (the Drug Trafficking Act), as in force at the relevant time: 10.
Interest on sums unpaid under confiscation orders. (1) If any sum required to be paid by a person under a confiscation order is not paid when it is required to be paid (whether forthwith on the making of the order or at a time specified under section 139(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000) that person shall be liable to pay interest on that sum for the period for which it remains unpaid; and the amount of the interest shall for the purposes of enforcement be treated as part of the amount to be recovered from him under the confiscation order. (2) The Crown Court may, on the application of the prosecutor, increase the term of imprisonment or detention fixed in respect of the confiscation order under subsection (2) of section 139 of the 2000 Act (as it has effect by virtue of section 9 of this Act) if the effect of subsection (1) above is to increase the maximum period applicable in relation to the order under subsection (4) of that section. (3) The rate of interest under subsection (1) above shall be the same rate as that specified in section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838 (interest on civil judgment debts).
For present purposes, the key provisions are: (1) the concluding words of section 10(1), by which the interest is to be treated for the purposes of enforcement as part of the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order; and section 10(2), which enables a Crown Court judge to re fix, and (2) increase, the default term if the addition of accrued interest takes the sum outstanding into a higher bracket in the relevant schedule of permissible default terms.
If the statutory scheme had stopped at this point, there would no doubt have been a powerful argument for saying that for all enforcement purposes interest is simply added to the original confiscation order.
But this apparently fairly simple provision has to be considered in its place in the much more complex statutory scheme under which the magistrates powers of commitment to prison are made applicable to confiscation orders.
The application of the magistrates powers of commitment
In common with other confiscation statutes, the Drug Trafficking Act referred enforcement by committal to prison to the Magistrates Court.
By the time of the 2007 commitment proceedings in this case, section 9 provided: 9.
Application of procedure for enforcing fines. (1) Where the Crown Court orders the defendant to pay any amount under section 2 of this Act, sections 139(1) to (4) and 140(1) to (3) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (powers of Crown Court in relation to fines and enforcement of Crown Court fines) shall have effect as if that amount were a fine imposed on him by the Crown Court.
The provisions there referred to in the (essentially consolidating) Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (the 2000 Sentencing Act) were previously contained in sections 31 and 32 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973, to which section 9 in its original form referred.
In the courts below all parties, and thus the courts, proceeded on the basis that the 1973 provisions were the relevant ones.
It was common ground before this court that the 2000 Act provisions had become the relevant ones by the time of the commitment proceedings in this case.
The difference does not matter, because although the wording is not identical, it is agreed that the effect of the two sets of provisions is the same.
It follows that section 9 of the Drug Trafficking Act referred one on to sections 139 and 140 of the 2000 Sentencing Act, which are about fines.
So far as material, they provided as follows: 139.
Powers and duties of Crown Court in relation to fines and forfeited recognizances. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, if the Crown Court imposes a fine on any person or forfeits his recognizance, the court may make an order (a) allowing time for the payment of the amount of the fine or the amount due under the recognizance; (b) directing payment of that amount by instalments of such amounts and on such dates as may be specified in the order; (c) [applicable only to recognizances] (2) Subject to the provisions of this section, if the Crown Court imposes a fine on any person or forfeits his recognizance, the court shall make an order fixing a term of imprisonment or of detention under section 108 above (detention of persons aged 18 to 20 for default) which he is to undergo if any sum which he is liable to pay is not duly paid or recovered. 140.
Enforcement of fines imposed and recognizances forfeited by Crown Court. (1) Subject to subsection (5) below, a fine imposed or a recognizance forfeited by the Crown Court shall be treated for the purposes of collection, enforcement and remission of the fine or other sum as having been imposed or forfeited (a) by a magistrates court specified in an order made by the Crown Court, or if no such order is made, by the magistrates (b) court by which the offender was committed to the Crown Court to be tried or dealt with or by which he was sent to the Crown Court for trial under section 51 or 51A of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and, in the case of a fine, as having been so imposed on conviction by the magistrates court in question. (2) Subsection (3) below applies where a magistrates court issues a warrant of commitment on a default in the payment of a fine imposed by the Crown Court; or a sum due under a recognizance forfeited by the (a) (b) Crown Court.
In such a case, the term of imprisonment or detention (3) under section 108 above specified in the warrant of commitment as the term which the offender is liable to serve shall be (a) 139(2) above, or (b) if that term has been reduced under section 79(2) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 (part payment) or section 85(2) of that Act (remission), that term as so reduced, the term fixed by the Crown Court under section notwithstanding that that term exceeds the period applicable to the case under section 149(1) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (maximum periods of imprisonment in default of payment of certain fines).
Subsection (5), referred to in section 140(1), removes from the magistrates the power to remit part of a fine if the fine was imposed by the Crown Court.
A similar stipulation against remission is additionally specifically applied to confiscation orders by section 9(4)(a) of the Drug Trafficking Act.
It follows that the statutory scheme for the enforcement of confiscation orders proceeded then, as it does now, by a process of successive referrals.
First, section 9 of the Drug Trafficking Act makes the confiscation order enforceable as if it were a fine imposed by the Crown Court.
That refers one on to the 2000 Sentencing Act, by which a fine imposed by the Crown Court is by section 140(1) treated for enforcement purposes as if it had been imposed by the magistrates, and thus so is a confiscation order.
But the magistrates general powers in relation to their own fines are not in the 2000 Sentencing Act; they are found in the Magistrates Courts Act 1980, to which one is thus further referred on.
It is in the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 (section 76) that the magistrates power to commit to prison for failure to pay a fine is found, together with an alternative power to issue a warrant of distress (now re named a warrant of control).
And it is in the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 that the only provision dealing with part payments is found.
That is section 79 which at the time material to these magistrates proceedings read as follows: 79.
Release from custody and reduction of detention on payment. (1) Where imprisonment or other detention has been imposed on any person by the order of a magistrates court in default of payment of any sum adjudged to be paid by the conviction or order of a magistrates court or for want of sufficient distress to satisfy such a sum, then, on the payment of the sum, together with the costs and charges, if any, of the commitment and distress, the order shall cease to have effect; and if the person has been committed to custody he shall be released unless he is in custody for some other cause. (2) Where, after a period of imprisonment or other detention has been imposed on any person in default of payment of any sum adjudged to be paid by the conviction or order of a magistrates court or for want of sufficient distress to satisfy such a sum, payment is made in accordance with rules of court of part of the sum, the period of detention shall be reduced by such number of days as bears to the total number of days in that period less one day the same proportion as the amount so paid bears to so much of the said sum, and the costs and charges of any distress levied to satisfy that sum, as was due at the time the period of detention was imposed. (3) In calculating the reduction required under subsection (2) above any fraction of a day shall be left out of account.
The problem of part payments
Many of the difficulties which have beset the present case arise out of the fact that the enforcement of confiscation orders is thus achieved by applying to them statutory provisions which were not designed for them.
In particular, the process of referrals just described has the effect that a confiscation order is treated for enforcement as if it was a fine imposed by the magistrates.
But there is a very important difference in practice as between fines imposed by magistrates and fines (and confiscation orders) imposed by the Crown Court.
In the case of the former, the magistrates do not fix a default term when imposing the fine.
Instead, they approach the matter of imprisonment in default only after default has occurred.
By then, of course, it will be known whether the default is total or partial, and the term imposed under the warrant of commitment can be, and ordinarily is, adjusted accordingly, thus in effect giving credit for part payments made before the commitment process is undertaken.
Section 79(1) and (2) then deal with the situation if whole (subsection (1)) or part (subsection (2)) payment is made after the warrant of commitment is issued.
But in the case of Crown Court fines and confiscation orders, section 139(2) of the 2000 Sentencing Act mandates the fixing of an anticipatory default term at the time the fine or order is imposed.
It follows that something is required to cope with part payments made after the Crown Court order and before the Magistrates proceedings, as well as with payments made after the latter.
This difference of practice led the courts below to analyse section 79(2) as assuming the standard magistrates practice and thus to conclude that the references in that subsection to a period of imprisonment having been imposed in default of payment were references to the act of the magistrates in issuing the warrant of commitment.
That in turn gave rise to the difficulty that, on that basis, section 79(2) would say nothing about how to deal with part payments made in a Crown Court case between the Crown Court order and the later magistrates proceedings, and there was no other provision which filled the gap.
The Court of Appeal understandably concluded that such part payments had to be taken into account, and to give effect to that conclusion it read two additional words into section 79(2) so that it read Where, before or after a period of imprisonment has been imposed : see [2017] 1 WLR 1115, para 51.
On the very helpful further argument which this court has had from counsel on both sides, it is now clear that section 79 does not, when it speaks of a period of imprisonment imposed in default of payment, necessarily refer only to the magistrates proceedings.
That will of course be the position when the default term is imposed in the ordinary case of magistrates deciding whether or not to issue a warrant of commitment some time after default has occurred.
But even then, the magistrates are entitled to issue the warrant and postpone its execution on terms, usually no doubt requiring prompt payment and perhaps by instalments.
Section 77(2) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 specifically so provides.
It follows that even in the case of an exclusively magistrates case, there may be a warrant of commitment without immediate imprisonment.
Before this court, the parties were agreed that in the case of a Crown Court confiscation order or fine, the period of imprisonment in default of payment is imposed for the purposes of section 79 when the Crown Court discharges its statutory duty under section 139(2) of the 2000 Sentencing Act and fixes the (anticipatory) term in default.
That is clearly the position where the period of imprisonment in default is imposed by the magistrates court, since section 79(1) specifically says that on full payment the default term ceases to have effect whether or not the person has been committed to prison, thus providing for the case permitted by section 77(2) where a warrant of commitment has been issued, but not yet executed.
It also follows from section 150 of the Magistrates Courts Act, to which the courts below were not referred.
That definition section provides: imprisonment means pass a sentence of impose imprisonment or fix a term of imprisonment for failure to pay any sum of money, or for want of sufficient distress to satisfy any sum of money, or for failure to do or abstain from doing anything required to be done or left undone.
This construction is also necessary to make sense of section 140(3) of the 2000 Sentencing Act, to which the courts below were not referred.
This section is in more expansive form than its predecessor, section 32 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973.
It makes clear by subsection 140(3)(b) that the default term fixed by the Crown Court may already have been reduced under section 79(2) of the Magistrates Court Act 1980 before the magistrates undertake the assessment of the length of any warrant of commitment.
Lastly, this construction is clearly assumed by the Magistrates Courts Rules 1981 (SI 1981/552), to which the courts below were again not referred.
These rules provide for the persons to whom part or full payment may be made for the purposes of section 79(2).
By rule 55(1)(a) the designated officer of the court may receive such payment unless there has been issued a warrant of commitment, whereas if there is such a warrant, the payment must be made by rule 55(1)(c) or (d) either to a constable holding it (for execution) or the prison governor.
That again demonstrates that payments which fall within section 79(2) can be made before a warrant of commitment is issued, although clearly they can only be made after the default term has been imposed.
Thus the default term in the case of Crown Court orders must be the term that court imposed at the time of making its order.
Does section 79(2) include interest in its starting point?
That leads one to the issue in the present case.
If the court which imposes the default term is, for the purposes of section 79(2), the Crown Court in the case of a confiscation order, which is the correct starting point for the arithmetical giving of proportionate credit for part payment? Is it the sum stated in the order as originally made by the Crown Court, or is it that sum plus any interest which has accrued by the time the exercise is conducted by the magistrates? In the present case, is it 5.4m or is it 8.1m?
For the Secretary of State, Mr Perry QC powerfully submits that it must be the original sum plus interest.
The plain purpose of the various statutory provisions for interest, including section 10 of the Drug Trafficking Act, is, he submits, that interest is treated for any enforcement purpose as added to the confiscation order and is expressly made part of the amount to be recovered from [the defendant] under the confiscation order.
So, it is said, the references in section 79(2) to the term set in default of payment of any sum adjudged to be paid must, by what he refers to as a necessary statutory fiction, be references to the sum fixed by the original confiscation order plus interest.
That is to do no more, he argues, than is already provided for in section 79(2) for the costs and charges of any distress which has been levied, which are expressly added to the principal sum outstanding.
Those also, he submits, will in the case of a Crown Court order, necessarily have been incurred after the default term was fixed by that Court.
He points to the plain intention, gathered from section 10(1), that interest is to be paid, and to the fact that in the case of a criminal who is in default of payment of the principal sum, civil means of enforcement of interest are unlikely to be effective.
He rightly reminds us that a confiscation order is premised on the proposition that the defendant has the means to pay, so that any default is his election.
If circumstances change in a way which reduces his ability to pay, the various confiscation statutes provide a procedure for application for a certificate of inadequacy and consequent downward reduction in the amount of the confiscation order.
Those arguments may well reflect, in a purposive manner, the kind of regime for which the successive statutory referrals might have provided.
The difficulty with them lies in the operative words of section 79(2), which are the only ones which provide for the treatment of part payments.
They say expressly that the days to be deducted are to be the number which bear the same proportion to the total default term imposed (by the Crown Court) as the part payments bear to so much of the said sum as was due at the time the period of detention was imposed.
If the Secretary of States argument is to be accepted, the words at the time the period of detention was imposed have to be done no little violence.
At the time the Crown Court imposed the default term, there was as yet no interest accrued at all.
We have concluded that this straining of the wording of section 79(2) cannot be justified in circumstances where it would adversely impact on the period of imprisonment to which a person would be subject.
Penal legislation is construed strictly, particularly where the penalty involves deprivation of liberty.
The words of section 79(2) do not provide clearly for a period of imprisonment calculated on the basis for which the Secretary of State contends; on the contrary, they suggest the natural construction that the starting point for the arithmetical calculation of reduction in days of imprisonment is the sum outstanding at the time of the Crown Court order.
Nor is the Secretary of States construction warranted by the example of the reference in section 79(2) to the costs and charges of distress, where such have been incurred.
Since section 79(2) was plainly not drafted with confiscation, or for that matter Crown Court fines, in mind, the reference is adequately explained by the orthodox case of the magistrates first issuing a warrant for distress and only subsequently fixing the default term for non payment; in such a case the reference to the sum outstanding at the time the period of detention was imposed makes perfectly good sense.
In any event, the addition of such costs and charges is expressly provided; that does not mean that an equivalent provision can be read in as a consequence of a provision in a different statute, namely section 10(1) of the Drug Trafficking Act.
A scheme under which the period of imprisonment served in default of payment in full of the amount specified in the confiscation order is based on the entire amount outstanding, including interest, may or may not be what the framers of the confiscation legislation might have wished for or intended if the point had been considered.
However, because the means adopted took the form of statutory reference (and re reference) to provisions which were drafted for a different purpose and without confiscation in mind, they have not achieved that effect.
If it is desired that they should do so, express legislation will be needed.
It is also of some relevance that the practical consequences of the Secretary of States proposed construction would, without specific machinery, be difficult to work out.
Interest accrues daily, so the net amount outstanding would also vary daily.
That difficulty may be met by a calculation geared to the particular day (or days) on which any part payment is made.
But additionally, this construction would have the effect of progressively reducing the incentive to make part payment, as interest rises, because the days credited for such part payment would progressively reduce.
Nor would such a scheme provide any consequences at all for the not uncommon defendant who simply makes no payment whatever.
Conclusion
For these reasons we would allow the appeal.
","The appellant was convicted of drug trafficking offences on 21 May 1999 and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.
On 29 March 2000, he was ordered to pay a little over 5.4 million by way of a confiscation order.
The order required the appellant to pay the amount within 12 months or serve six years imprisonment in default of payment.
On 4 May 2007, a receiver appointed to realise the appellants assets paid 12,500.
The magistrates deducted seven days from the six year term in default, to account for that part payment.
At that time interest had increased the net sum outstanding, allowing for the part payment, to 8.1 million.
Later in 2007 and 2011, the appellants receiver made further payments of 12,500 and 65,370.
The prison authorities calculated the reduction in the six year default term on the basis of the proportion which these payments bore to the 8.1 million at the time of his committal.
That produced a total reduction of 24 days.
Had the arithmetic been applied instead to an outstanding figure confined to the original 5.4m, an extra 11 days reduction would have been made.
The issue in the appeal is whether interest is included in the starting point under s.79(2) Magistrates Courts Act 1980 for the giving of proportionate credit for part payment of a confiscation order.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
Lord Reed and Lord Hughes give a joint judgment with which the other Justices agree.
The key provisions of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 (DTA), as in force at the relevant time, were s.10(1), which treats interest for the purposes of enforcement as part of the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order and s.10(2) which enables a Crown Court judge to refix and increase the default term if the addition of accrued interest takes the sum outstanding into a higher bracket in the relevant schedule of defaults terms. [7] At the relevant time, s.9 DTA stated that where the Crown Court orders a defendant to pay any amount under s.2 DTA, ss.139(1) (4) and 140(1) (3) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing Act) 2000 (the 2000 Sentencing Act) shall have the effect as if that amount were a fine imposed on the defendant by the Crown Court. [9] S.140(1) of the 2000 Sentencing Act treats for enforcement purposes a fine imposed by the Crown Court as if it had been imposed by the magistrates, and thus a confiscation order is treated the same.
S.76 Magistrates Courts Act 1980 contains the magistrates power to commit an individual to prison for failure to pay a fine and an alternative power to issue a warrant of distress (now named a warrant of control).
S.79 Magistrates Courts Act 1980 is the only provision dealing with part payments. [11] The difficulties in this case arise from the fact that the enforcement of confiscation orders is achieved by applying statutory provisions to confiscation orders which were not designed for them.
A confiscation order is thus treated as if it was a fine imposed by the magistrates.
The difference between a magistrates imposed fine and a Crown Court imposed fine is that magistrates do not fix a default term when imposing the fine.
Imprisonment in default is only considered in the event of a default and, at that time, the magistrates will know whether the default is total or partial.
Thus, credit can be given for part payments made before the commitment process is undertaken.
However, s.139(2) of the 2000 Sentencing Act mandates the fixing of an anticipatory default term at the time the fine or order is imposed. [12] The difference in practices led the lower courts to analyse s.79(2) Magistrates Courts Act 1980 as assuming the standard magistrates practice and thus to conclude that the references in that subsection to a period of imprisonment having been imposed in default of payment were references to the act of the magistrates in issuing the warrant of commitment.
This caused the consequential difficulty that s.79(2) would say nothing about how to deal with part payments made in Crown Court cases between the Crown Court making a confiscation order and the later magistrates proceedings.
Hence the Court of Appeal understandably read additional words into s.79(2). [13] The period of imprisonment in default of payment is imposed for the purposes of s.79 when the Crown Court discharges its statutory duty under s.139(2) of the 2000 Sentencing Act and fixes the (anticipatory) term in default.
This construction follows from s.150 Magistrates Courts Act 1980 and is necessary to make sense of s.140(3) of the 2000 Sentencing Act.
It is also assumed by the Magistrates Court Rules.
Thus, the default term in the case of Crown Court orders must be the term that the court imposed at the time of making its order. [15 17] The operative words of s.79(2) expressly say that the days to be deducted are to be the number which bear the same proportion to the total default term imposed (by the Crown Court) as the part payments bear to so much of the said sum as was due at the time the period of detention was imposed.
At the time the Crown Court imposed the default term, there was as yet no interest accrued at all. [20] Straining of the wording of s.79(2) cannot be justified where it would adversely impact on the period of imprisonment to which a person is subject.
Penal legislation, particularly legislation imposing penalties that deprive liberty, is construed strictly.
The natural construction of the section is that the starting point for the arithmetical calculation of reduction in days of imprisonment is the sum outstanding at the time of the Crown Court order. [21] charges of distress do not support the respondents construction.
The reference is explained by the case of magistrates first issuing a warrant for distress and only subsequently fixing the default term for non payment.
The addition of such costs and charges is expressly provided for and that does not mean that an equivalent provision can be read in as a consequence of a provision in different statute (s.10(1) DTA). [22]
"
uksc-2011-0233,"On 6 August 2003 a young man of 17 and a young girl of 13 had sexual intercourse.
Afterwards the young girl told her mother that this had occurred but she suggested that she had not been a willing participant.
Understandably, her mother went to the police and the young man was arrested.
Later her daughter retracted her account of not having consented to sexual relations.
The young man was therefore charged with a less serious offence than that which he might have faced.
It was, nonetheless, a serious charge.
He was charged with having had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 14 years contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland) 1885 1923.
The young man pleaded guilty to that charge at Belfast Crown Court on 22 June 2004.
That plea had been entered on the basis that the offence created by section 4 was one in which reasonable belief that the girl was over the age of 14 was not available to him as a defence.
The defendant was sentenced to three years detention in a Young Offenders Centre.
The sentence was suspended for two years.
Later, having received different legal advice from that which had prompted his plea of guilty, the young man applied to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland for leave to appeal against his conviction.
The issue before the Court of Appeal was whether section 4 of the 1885 Act created an offence in which proof that the defendant did not honestly believe that the girl was over the age of 14 was not required.
That is also the issue with which this court has had to deal.
The legislative provisions
Traditionally, sexual offences (other than forced intercourse) against girls and young women have been dealt with in legislation according to age bands, with, in general, more grave offences reserved for and heavier penalties imposed for crimes involving younger females.
A clearly discernible historical trend of increasing the age of the victim at which liability for more serious offences is incurred, while reducing the sentence to be imposed, can be detected.
Thus, section 20 of the Offences against the Person (Ireland) Act 1829 provided that any person who had unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of ten years was guilty of a felony, punishable by death.
By contrast, the same section provided that unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between ten and 12 years was a misdemeanour punishable by a term of imprisonment at the discretion of the court.
Section 50 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 reduced the sentence to be imposed for the felony of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of ten to, at the discretion of the court, penal servitude for life or for a term of not less than three years or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years with or without hard labour.
For unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of ten and 12, a defendant was guilty of a misdemeanour under section 51 of the same Act and liable to be sentenced to penal servitude for three years or to be imprisoned for up to two years with or without hard labour.
Section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1875 made it a felony to unlawfully and carnally know and abuse any girl under the age of 12 years.
Section 4(3) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (Northern Ireland) 1923 provided that the Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland) 1885 1912 and the Criminal Law Amendment Act (Northern Ireland) 1923 should, to the extent to which they applied to Northern Ireland, be cited together as the Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland) 1885 1923.
Section 2 of the 1885 1923 Acts provided for a procuration offence: Any person who . procures or attempts to procure any girl or woman under 21 years of age to have unlawful carnal connexion, either within or without the Queen's dominions, with any other
person or persons . shall be guilty of a misdemeanour
Section 4, as amended, and in so far as is relevant to the present appeal, provided that Any person who unlawfully and carnally knows any girl under the age of 14 years shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable to be imprisoned for life or to be fined or both. (As originally enacted, section 4 had stipulated an age of 13 years.
This was increased to 14 by the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1950).
As also originally enacted, section 5 of the 1885 Act provided for an offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between 13 and 15.
The age limit was increased by section 13 of the 1950 Act so that in its amended form it provided as follows: Any person who . unlawfully and carnally knows or attempts to have unlawful carnal knowledge of any girl under the age of 17
years; shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
offence of permitting defilement on premises: Section 6, as amended by section 13 of the 1950 Act, provided for an Any person who, being the owner or occupier of any premises, or having, or acting or assisting in, the management or control thereof induces or knowingly suffers any girl to resort to or be in or upon such premises for the purpose of being unlawfully and carnally known by any man, whether such carnal knowledge is intended to be with any particular man or generally, shall . if such girl is under the
age of 17 years be guilty of a misdemeanour
Section 7 provided for an offence of abduction: Any person who with intent that any unmarried girl under the age of 18 years should be unlawfully and carnally known by any man, whether such carnal knowledge is intended to be with any particular man, or generally takes or causes to be taken such girl out of the possession and against the will of her father or mother, or any other person having the lawful care or charge of her, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years or to be fined or both.
Provided that it shall be a sufficient defence to any charge under this section if it shall be made to appear to the court or jury that the person so charged had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was of or above the age of 18 years.
Provisos of a similar nature to that contained in the latter part of section 7 were included in sections 5 and 6 of the 1885 Act as originally enacted.
These were removed by section 2 of the 1923 Act, as amended by section 13 of the 1950 Act: Reasonable cause to believe that a girl was of or above the age of 17 years shall not be a defence to a charge under sub section (1) of section five or under section six of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act 1885
In August 2003, therefore, the Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland) 1885 1923 included five offences in which age was an essential component of the actus reus, of which two (sections 2 and 4) were silent as to the effect, if any, of reasonable belief as to the age of the girl; two (sections 5 and 6) were subject to an express exclusion of a defence of reasonable belief as to age; and one (section 7) was subject to a defence of reasonable belief as to age.
Thus, from 1885 until 1923, unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl of 13 years or more was not an offence under section 4.
During the same period such an offence was committed under section 5 of the 1885 Act if the girl was between the ages of 13 and 15 but a defence of reasonable belief that the girl was 16 years or more was available.
From 1923 until 1950 unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl of 13 or more continued not to be an offence under section 4.
During that time, however, unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between 13 and 15 years did not require proof under section 5 that the defendant did not believe that the girl was over the age of 16.
From 1950 onwards sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 14 became an offence under section 4.
The appellants arguments
The appellant argued that the approach to the interpretation of section 4 of the 1885 1923 Acts must be informed by a fundamental common law principle.
This was that there should be a mental element, commonly referred to as mens rea, for criminal liability unless a clear intention was evinced by the words of a statute that a particular criminal offence should be one of strict liability.
The presumption that mens rea was required could only be displaced, it was suggested, where it could be shown that this was the unmistakable intention of Parliament.
Such an intention was less readily found to exist where the offence was a serious one.
In this regard, reliance was placed on the judgment in R v Muhamad [2003] QB 1031 where, at para 19, Dyson LJ said: The offences where no mental element is specified, for the most part, attract considerably lower maximum sentences than those where a mental element is specified.
Since section 4 was silent on the question of whether proof of mens rea was required, the appellant submitted that the offence specified in the provision could only be regarded as not requiring such proof if that had to be unavoidably and necessarily implied.
The suggestion that a particular provision imposed strict liability had to be considered, the appellant argued, in its statutory and social contexts.
The Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland) 1885 1923 fell to be interpreted as they stood at the time of the appellant's offence: that is, with an express provision making clear that no defence of reasonable belief applied to sections 5 and 6, but remaining silent as to the mens rea of an offence contrary to section 4.
The legislative history of the relevant provisions, although not irrelevant, was, the appellant argued, merely one factor to be taken into account.
In this regard, reference was made to the speech of Lord Steyn in R v K [2002] 1 AC 462, para 30 where he said that it was unhelpful to inquire into the history of subjective views held by individual legislators and that the always speaking nature of a statute dealing with sexual offences meant that a particular provision had to be interpreted in the world as it exists today, and in the light of the legal system as it exists today.
The statutory context of section 4 therefore suggested that the presumption that mens rea was required had not been displaced.
The appellant argued further that, if an implication of strict liability was to be considered as compellingly clear, it must arise from a coherent and consistent legislative scheme.
The Acts of 1885 1923 did not fit that description.
The express provision of a defence of reasonable belief to an offence under section 7, when considered alongside the explicit exclusion of such a defence to offences under sections 5 and 6, and silence on the issue under section 4, meant that the legislation contained signposts which pointed in various directions.
It was impossible to detect a convincingly obvious implication.
As to the social context of the offence under section 4, the appellant again referred to the particular strength of the presumption where the offence was serious or, as described by Lord Scarman in Gammon (Hong Kong) v Attorney General of Hong Kong [1985] AC 1, 14, truly criminal.
The offence under section 4 was unquestionably serious and carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
As Lord Bingham said in Sheldrake v Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] 1 AC 264, para 6, The more serious the crime, and the more severe the potential consequences of conviction, the less readily will it be displaced.
The appellant accepted that section 4 dealt with an issue of social concern but pointed out that Lord Scarman in Gammon (Hong Kong) v Attorney General of Hong Kong had observed that the presumption of mens rea should stand unless it could be shown that the creation of strict liability would be effective to promote the objects of the statute.
The objects of the statute in this context were considered to be the encouraging of greater vigilance to prevent the commission of the prohibited act.
To the extent that strict liability might be said to promote the objects of the statute by encouraging greater vigilance against sexual intercourse with girls under the age of 17, it was submitted that this was sufficiently achieved in Northern Ireland by the strict liability imposed under section 5.
Finally, in a written submission provided on his behalf after the hearing of the appeal before this court, it was pointed out that the appellant could not have been convicted of the section 4 offence in 1885 (the time of the original enactment) since the offence at that time related to girls under the age of 13.
Nor could he have been convicted of such an offence until 1950.
An analysis of whether the common law presumption was displaced had to be conducted against the background that no consistent policy approach had been adopted to the question of whether unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 14 years should be a strict liability offence.
The case for the respondent
The proviso introduced by sections 5 and 6 of the 1885 Act introduced for the first time, the respondent explained, a defence of reasonable belief as to the age of the person against whom an offence under these sections was charged.
The background against which the defence had been made available was that R v Prince (1875) LR 2 CCR 154 had held that reasonable grounds for believing that the girl involved was over the age of consent did not constitute a defence under section 51 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.
But when Parliament came to abrogate that rule in 1885, it did so (by virtue of section 5 of the 1885 Act) only in relation to girls between the ages of 13 and 16.
It did not do so in relation to girls under the age of 13.
The decision not to provide for a similar defence under section 4 of the 1885 Act could not have been other than deliberate, it was argued.
This was not the only distinction between sections 4 and 5, however.
A limitation period of three months on the prosecution of offences under section 5 was also provided for but there was no corresponding provision in section 4. (This limitation period was subsequently increased to 12 months but it was expressly recommended that no such limitation should be introduced for an offence of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13 because of the gravity of that particular offence in this regard, see R v J [2005] 1 AC 562, para 10).
Section 4 of the 1885 Act also made specific provision for a lesser sentence in respect of an attempt.
And, as originally enacted, it also provided for a less severe sentence with respect to young offenders under 16.
Neither of these different sentencing options was provided for by section 5(1), however.
In England and Wales maintenance of the distinction between, on the one hand section 4 and, on the other, sections 5 and 6 of the 1885 Act, could be seen, the respondent argued, in the amendments introduced by section 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1922.
It appears that the government had intended to remove altogether the defence of reasonable cause to believe that the girl was over the age of 16 years but, by way of compromise, introduced what has become known as the young mans defence.
By virtue of section 2 of the 1922 Act a man of 23 years or less could avail of the defence (on the first occasion that he was charged with an offence under sections 5 or 6 of the 1885 Act) that he had reasonable cause to believe that the girl was over the age of 16 years.
No such defence was provided for in relation to offences under section 4.
In 1923 the Northern Ireland Parliament, in one of its first items of legislation, achieved, according to the respondent, what Parliament in Westminster had failed to bring about in 1922, namely, the complete abolition of the defence of reasonable belief on the part of the defendant that the girl was above the age of consent.
To have abolished that defence in relation to sections 5 and 6 while leaving open the question whether such a defence might be available in respect of the more serious offence under section 4 was inconceivable, the respondent claimed.
It was therefore argued that it has always been undeniably clear that an offence under section 4 should be one in which proof of mens rea as to the age of the victim was not required.
Discussion
The constitutional principle that mens rea is presumed to be required in order to establish criminal liability is a strong one.
It is not to be displaced in the absence of clear statutory language or unmistakably necessary implication.
And true it is, as the appellant has argued, that the legislative history of an enactment may not always provide the framework for deciding whether the clearly identifiable conditions in which an implication must be made are present.
It is also undeniable that where the statutory offence is grave or truly criminal and carries a heavy penalty or a substantial social stigma, the case is enhanced against implying that mens rea of any ingredient of the offence is not needed.
The strength of the constitutional principle in favour of a presumption that criminal liability requires proof of mens rea finds eloquent expression in what Lord Nicholls, in B (A Minor) v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] 2 AC 428, 460, referred to as the magisterial statement of Lord Reid in Sweet v Parsley [1970] AC 132, 148 149: there has for centuries been a presumption that Parliament did not intend to make criminals of persons who were in no way blameworthy in what they did.
That means that whenever a section is silent as to mens rea there is a presumption that, in order to give effect to the will of Parliament, we must read in words appropriate to require mens rea . it is firmly established by a host of authorities that mens rea is an essential ingredient of every offence unless some
reason can be found for holding that that is not necessary
where he said: In B (A Minor) Lord Nicholls reinforced that essential message at p 460G the starting point for a court is the established common law presumption that a mental element, traditionally labelled mens rea, is an essential ingredient unless Parliament has indicated a contrary intention either expressly or by necessary implication.
The common law presumes that, unless Parliament has indicated otherwise, the appropriate mental element is an unexpressed ingredient of every statutory offence.
One must begin, therefore, with this strong presumption firmly at centre stage.
And its ready displacement should not be countenanced, as has, perhaps, happened in the past.
In Smith and Hogans Criminal Law, 13th ed (2011), para 7.2 the authors deprecated the tendency of some judges to declaim that the presumption was well embedded only to willingly find that it was easily rebutted.
Lord Bingham made clear in R v K [2002] 1 AC 462, para 18 that description of an offence such as that prescribed by section 4 as an absolute offence or an offence of strict liability is a misnomer.
There must always be deliberation on the part of the defendant in committing the acts which constitute the factual underpinning of the offence.
The real and proper question is whether it must be proved that there was a lack of reasonable belief, on the part of the perpetrator of the acts, that the girl was above the prescribed age.
In R v K at para 17 Lord Bingham referred with approval to Lord Steyns quotation in B (A Minor) at p 470F of Professor Sir Rupert Crosss statement that the presumption that mens rea was required in the case of all statutory crimes was a constitutional principle not easily displaced by a statutory text.
These sturdy assertions provide the setting for the inquiry whether mens rea in relation to the girls age had to be proved in order to found liability under section 4.
That inquiry must start, I believe, with a clear understanding of what the legal position was at the time that the relevant provisions were enacted.
It is true that the subjective intention of individual legislators will not always provide an incontrovertible guide to the meaning of the legislation, as Lord Steyn said in R v K.
But one must at least begin with an examination of what the legislative intention was before considering whether modification of that intention is justified by later amendments or contemporary social contexts.
In my view, there can really be no doubt that section 4 in its original form was intended to impose criminal liability for carnal knowledge of a female under the age of 13 without proof that the perpetrator knew or had reason to believe that she was below that age.
Two considerations make that conclusion inevitable.
Firstly, the decision in R v Prince had confirmed that proof of knowledge or lack of reasonable belief in the age of the victim was not required.
Coming as it did merely ten years before the 1885 Act, that decision formed the crucial backdrop to the enactment of section 4.
It is inconceivable that, had it been intended that such proof was required, section 4 would have remained silent on the issue.
Secondly and relatedly, the juxtaposition of sections 5 and 6 (in which a dispensing proviso was contained) with section 4 makes it impossible to conclude that the absence of such a proviso in section 4 signified anything other than a clear intention that a defence of reasonable belief in the girls age was not to be available.
This is particularly so because the 1885 Act introduced for the first time such a defence in relation to offences of the type provided for in sections 5 and 6.
It seems to me unquestionable that the decision not to extend the defence to offences under section 4 was deliberate and that it clearly signified that the legislature intended that no such defence would be available in relation to offences under that section.
That being so, the next question is whether the amendment in the 1923 Act made any difference to the availability of the defence under section 4.
The appellant contended that the textual amendment of the 1885 Act prompted consideration within a new context of the question whether the presumption that mens rea is required had been displaced.
A change to the statutory framework, the appellant argued, required examination of that question from an entirely new perspective one in which, in contrast to that which had hitherto obtained, the defence of reasonable belief no longer applied to sections 5 and 6 (as a consequence of explicit provision to that effect) but the question of whether it applied to offences under section 4 was open because of the absence of any reference to it in that section.
It would be a curious, indeed anomalous, outcome of the removal of the defence from sections 5 and 6 that it should be implied into section 4 to which it had not previously applied.
At a technical or theoretical level, it can be argued that such a result is feasible because, as the appellant has submitted, the 1885 1923 Acts are to be construed as a whole in their amended form.
Bennion on Statutory Interpretation, 5th ed (2008) describes the effect of textual amendment of a statute at p 290 as follows: . under modern practice the intention of Parliament when effecting textual amendment of an Act is usually to produce a revised text of the Act which is thereafter to be construed as a whole.
Any repealed provisions are to be treated as never having been there, so far as concerns the application of the amended Act for the future. (original emphasis)
The appellant has pointed out that in B (A Minor), in deciding whether the presumption was rebutted, both Lord Nicholls and Lord Steyn had taken account of the amendment of the applicable maximum penalty from two to ten years imprisonment.
And in R v Kumar [2005] 1 WLR 1352, paras 11 13, 28, the Court of Appeal construed section 12 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 in its present form within an amended statutory framework that included the Sexual Offences Act 1967 and amendments to section 12 in 1994 and 2000, by virtue of which homosexual acts between consenting males of a prescribed age were decriminalised.
It was suggested therefore that a new approach to the interpretation of section 4 is now warranted.
I cannot accept that argument.
In the first place, while the amended legislation is to be construed as a whole in its revised form, it does not follow that its antecedent history be left entirely out of account.
More pertinently, the relevant amendment of the 1885 Act removed a defence which had previously been available for offences under sections 5 and 6 when none had existed for offences under section 4.
To suggest that the removal of the defence under sections 5 and 6 would have the effect of introducing it under section 4 by implication takes contrivance too far.
I am satisfied that in its statutory context section 4 must be interpreted as not requiring proof that the defendant did not know or reasonably believe that the girl was aged 14 or over.
The appellants argument that the Acts of 1885 1923 did not form a coherent and consistent legislative scheme must likewise be rejected.
The fact that the legislation contained signposts which pointed in various directions does not render it incoherent.
It is entirely logical (and in keeping with the historical trend described earlier) that a defence of reasonable belief should be available for the less serious offences prescribed by sections 5 and 6, but that it should not exist for the more grave offence under section 4.
For essentially the same reasons, I would reject the appellants argument that there was no consistent policy approach to the question of whether unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 14 years should be a strict liability offence.
On the contrary, the policy approach of protecting younger females by ensuring that a defence of reasonable belief should not be available has been unswerving.
The fact that the age was increased from 13 to 14 does not make the policy inconsistent.
It merely represents the evolution of changing views as to when the policy should take effect.
Finally, there is nothing in the contemporary social context which militates against the denial of the defence of reasonable belief as to age for section 4 offences.
This issue was dealt with authoritatively in R v G (Secretary of State for the Home Department intervening) [2009] AC 92.
In that case the appellant had pleaded guilty to an offence of rape of a child under the age of 13, contrary to section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.
The prosecution had accepted the appellants claim that the girl had consented to sexual intercourse and had told him that she was 15 years old.
The appellant himself was 15 at the time of the offence and the girl was aged 12.
At para 3 Lord Hoffmann said: The mental element of the offence under section 5, as the language and structure of the section makes clear, is that penetration must be intentional but there is no requirement that the accused must have known that the other person was under 13.
The policy of the legislation is to protect children.
If you have sex with someone who is on any view a child or young person, you take your chance on exactly how old they are.
To that extent the offence is one of strict liability and it is no defence that the accused believed the other person to be 13 or over.
Precisely the same policy considerations underpin section 4 of the 1885 1923 Acts.
Young girls must be protected and, as part of that protection, it should not be a defence that the person accused believed the girl to be above the prescribed age.
As Lady Hale said in para 46 of G, When the child is under 13 [the accused] takes the risk that she may be younger than he thinks she is.
The object is to make him take responsibility for what he chooses to do If you have sexual intercourse with someone who is clearly a child or young person, you do so at your peril.
I would dismiss the appeal.
","The question in this appeal is whether there is a requirement for the prosecution to prove a defendant had an absence of belief that the person they were having sexual intercourse with was over the age of 13, before they can be convicted of an offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 14.
The appellant, who was 17 years old at the time, had sexual intercourse with a 13 year old girl.
Initially the girl informed her mother of this fact but told her the intercourse had not been consensual.
The appellant was arrested.
Subsequently however, the girl withdrew the allegation and admitted the sex had been consensual.
As a result, the appellant was charged with the offence of having unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 14 contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland 1885 1923) (the 1885 Act) a serious offence that carries a maximum of life imprisonment.
The appellant was represented and pleaded guilty to the charge at Belfast Crown Court in 2004.
He was sentenced to 3 years detention in a Young Offenders Centre, suspended for 2 years.
He had pleaded guilty on the understanding that it was no defence to a charge under section 4 for the defendant to show he believed the girl was over the age of 13.
Following his conviction the appellant received advice from different solicitors and launched an appeal, arguing that the Crown was indeed required to prove that the appellant did not believe the girl was over 13 years old.
The appellant argued before the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal that section 4 was silent as to such a defence but in view of the legislative history and its seriousness, it must be presumed that there is a mental element to the offence.
The appellant relied on the general presumption that criminal offences require the prosecution to prove mens rea i.e. some intent on the part of the accused, unless explicitly excluded by the language of the statute or necessarily inferred from the language of the offence.
Such a presumption is hard to displace, especially in relation to serious offences.
The Court of Appeal rejected the appellants arguments and held that no defence of reasonable or honest belief existed.
All that was necessary was for the prosecution to prove the accused had had sex with a girl who was actually under the age of 14.
The appellant thus appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
Lord Kerr gives the judgment of the court.
A clearly discernible historical trend of increasing the age at which liability for more serious offences is incurred, while reducing the sentence imposed, can be detected [3].
Section 4 as originally enacted referred to unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 13 years old.
This was amended to 14 years by the Children and Young Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1950 (the 1950 Act).
Section 5 of the 1885 Act created the same offence in relation to a girl between the ages of 13 15.
Section 5 and section 6 (permitting defilement on premises) contained provisos that it would be a defence to show that the accused reasonably believed the girl was of or above the age of 16 years.
Such defences were abolished by section 2 of the Criminal Law (Northern Ireland) Amendment Act 1923, as amended by section 140 of the 1950 Act.
Section 5 thus referred to any girl under 17 years old, with an express prohibition of any defence of reasonable belief that she was 17 or older.
No such type of defence has ever been explicitly provided in any version of section 4 [7 13].
The constitutional principle that mens rea is presumed to be required in order to establish criminal liability is a strong one.
It is not to be displaced in the absence of clear statutory language or unmistakably necessary implication.
Where the statutory offence is grave and carries a heavy penalty or a substantial social stigma, the case is enhanced against implying that mens rea of any ingredient of the offence is not needed [26].
One must at least begin with an examination of what the legislative intention was before considering whether modification of that intention is justified by later amendments or contemporary social contexts [31].
There can really be no doubt that the section in its original form was intended to impose criminal liability for carnal knowledge of a female under the age of 14 without proof that the perpetrator knew or had reason to believe that she was below that age.
The decision in R v Prince (1875) LR 2 CCR 154 10 years prior to the 1885 Act confirmed that proof of knowledge or lack of reasonable belief in the age of the victim was not required under section 51 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.
This formed the crucial backdrop to the 1885 Act.
The juxtaposition of sections 5 and 6 of the 1885 Act, which originally contained a defence of reasonable belief, with section 4 make it clear that no such defence was to be provided for under the latter section [32].
It would be anomalous if the subsequent removal of the defence from sections 5 and 6 meant that it should be implied into section 4 to which it had not previously applied [34].
While the amended legislation is to be construed in its revised form, it does not follow that its antecedent history has to be entirely left out of account.
To suggest that the removal of the defence under sections 5 and 6 would have the effect of introducing it under section 4 by implication takes contrivance too far [36].
The policy approach of protecting younger females by ensuring that a defence of reasonable belief should not be available has been unswerving.
Further, there is nothing in the contemporary social context which militates against the denial of the defence of belief as to age for section 4 offences [37 38].
"
uksc-2012-0143,"Is a person who has been extradited to this country for trial on a criminal charge, and who prior to his extradition was guilty of contempt of court by disobeying a court order, open to punishment for his contempt although it was not the basis of his extradition? The answer depends in part on the proper interpretation of the so called specialty or speciality provisions of the Extradition Act 2003 and partly on the law relating to contempt.
The speciality principle (widely recognised in extradition law and extradition treaties) prohibits a person who has been extradited for a particular offence or offences from being dealt with by the requesting state for another offence or offences committed (or alleged to have been committed) before his extradition, subject to such exceptions as may be contained in the relevant statute or treaty.
Mr OBrien appeals against a decision of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal (Gross LJ, Openshaw J and Judge Milford QC) [2012] 1 WLR 3170, upholding an order of the Common Serjeant (Judge Barker QC) committing him to prison for 15 months for contempt of court in disobeying a restraint order made against him under section 41 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).
The appellant does not dispute that he was guilty of contempt, but he submits that his committal was unlawful by reason of the specialty provisions of Part 3 of the Extradition Act 2003.
After committing the contempt the appellant fled to the USA, from where he was extradited to the UK for other reasons.
It is submitted that it was not thereafter open to the English court to punish him for his earlier contempt, for which he had not been extradited.
The Court of Appeal certified the following points of law of general public importance: i.
Whether a contempt of court constituted by breach of a restraint order made under section 41 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 constitutes a civil or criminal contempt. ii.
If the answer to i) is a civil contempt, whether Section 151A of the Extradition Act 2003 and/or article 18 of the United Kingdom United States Extradition Treaty 2003 preclude/s a court from dealing with a person for such a contempt when that person has been extradited to the United Kingdom in respect of criminal offences but not the contempt in question.
In 2009 the Appellant came under investigation on suspicion of involvement in a large scale scheme to defraud investors, commonly known as a boiler room fraud.
On 24 September 2009 the Common Serjeant made a restraint order against him under section 41 of POCA.
It required the appellant, among other things, to make disclosure of his assets, not to remove assets from England and Wales, and to repatriate within 21 days any moveable asset in which he had an interest outside England and Wales.
The order was prefaced in the usual way with a penal notice, that is, a warning that if he disobeyed the order he may be held to be in contempt of court and imprisoned, fined or have his assets seized.
In this respect the order followed the standard form of freezing order in civil proceedings (originally known as a Mareva order), on which the statutory criminal restraint order provisions were modelled.
The appellant failed to comply with the restraint order and he fled the jurisdiction.
On 18 December 2009 the Common Serjeant found that he was in contempt of court, issued a warrant for his arrest and adjourned the imposition of a penalty.
Six months later the Appellant was traced to Chicago.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) by now wanted his extradition in order to prosecute him on charges relating to the alleged fraud.
They sought the assistance of the US authorities and a federal arrest warrant was issued against him.
On 8 October 2010 he was arrested in Chicago and appeared before the local US District Court.
He consented to his extradition in accordance with the UKs request but did not waive entitlement to the benefit of the specialty principle.
The SFO was initially under the impression that as a matter of law the appellants contempt was criminal in nature.
However, the United Kingdom United States Extradition Treaty 2003 limited extradition to offences punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or more, and in the USA the maximum sentence for the appellants contempt, if punishable as a misdemeanour, would have been six months imprisonment.
In those circumstances the SFO was concerned that there might be complications if the appellant were returned to the UK under an extradition order for prosecution for the boiler room fraud but at the same time was subject to a bench warrant for the earlier contempt.
This concern led the SFO to apply to the Common Serjeant to set aside the bench warrant, and on 30 November 2010 he did so.
On 2 December 2010 the appellant was returned to the UK.
He was arrested, charged with various offences of fraud and remanded in custody.
On further consideration, the SFO came to the view that the appellants contempt was not a criminal offence and so was not affected by the specialty principle.
It therefore applied to the Common Serjeant for the appellants committal.
The appellant objected that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the application.
In a judgment delivered on 1 April 2011 the Common Serjeant rejected the appellants objection.
After reviewing the authorities he concluded that the contempt was not a criminal offence, but was a civil contempt, and that the specialty principle therefore did not afford the appellant any protection.
The Court of Appeal upheld the Common Serjeants decision.
For the avoidance of doubt, the question whether the appellants contempt constituted a civil or criminal contempt made no difference to the jurisdiction of the Criminal Division to hear his appeal, by virtue of section 13 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 and section 53 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.
Section 13 of the 1960 Act provides that an appeal shall lie from any order or decision of a court in the exercise of jurisdiction to punish for contempt of court (including criminal contempt), and that such an appeal from the Crown Court shall lie to the Court of Appeal.
Section 53 of the 1981 Act provides that the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal shall exercise the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under the former section in relation to appeals from orders and decisions of the Crown Court.
Grounds of appeal
Mr Alun Jones QC advanced two arguments on behalf of the appellant.
His primary submission was that on the appellants extradition to the UK the Crown Court had no power to deal with him for his earlier contempt, no matter whether it constituted a civil or a criminal contempt.
If he failed on that point, his second submission was that the appellants contempt should be classified as criminal.
The first point depends on the proper construction of the Extradition Act.
The second depends on the law of contempt.
Extradition Act 2003
Part 1 of the Extradition Act deals with extradition from the UK to category 1 territories.
Part 2 deals with extradition from the UK to category 2 territories.
Part 3 deals with extradition to the UK from category 1 and 2 territories.
The USA is a category 2 territory.
The appellants argument is clear and simple.
Part 3 should be regarded as a self contained code governing extradition to the UK.
It comprises sections 142 155A (section 155A, as inserted by section 42 of, and paragraph 24 of Schedule 13 to, the Police and Justice Act 2006) but the important provisions for the purposes of the appellants argument are sections 148 and 151A (as inserted by section 76(3) of the Policing and Crime Act 2009).
Section 148(1) provides: Conduct constitutes an extradition offence in relation to the United Kingdom if these conditions are satisfied (a) the conduct occurs in the United Kingdom; (b) the conduct is punishable under the law of the relevant part of the United Kingdom with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment.
The appellants contempt occurred in the United Kingdom and was punishable under section 14(1) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 with imprisonment for longer than 12 months.
He submits that it was therefore an extradition offence within the definition of section 148.
Section 151A provides: (1) This section applies if a person is extradited to the United Kingdom from a territory which is not (a) a category 1 territory, or (b) a territory falling within section 150(1)(b) [which does not include the USA]. (2) The person may be dealt with in the United Kingdom for an offence committed before the persons extradition only if (a) the offence is one falling within subsection (3), or (b) the condition in subsection (4) is satisfied. (3) The offences are (a) (b) (c) (a) (b) the offence in respect of which the person is extradited; an offence disclosed by the information provided to the territory in respect of that offence; an offence in respect of which consent to the person being dealt with is given on behalf of the territory. (4) The condition is that the person has returned to the territory from which the person was extradited, the person has been given an opportunity to leave the United Kingdom. (5) A person is dealt with in the United Kingdom for an offence if (a) (b) the person is tried there for it; the person is detained with a view to trial there for it.
For reasons which I will explain, section 148 has no direct application to the extradition of a person to the United Kingdom from the United States.
However, two matters are not in dispute.
First, it is common ground that if the appellants contempt amounted to an offence within the meaning of section 151A, it was not open to a court in the United Kingdom to deal with him for that contempt.
Secondly, although an offence (in section 151A) is wider than an extradition offence (in section 148) in that it is not limited to an extraditable offence, it is not suggested that the meaning of the word offence itself varies in different sections of the Act.
If it means a criminal offence in one section it must mean a criminal offence in the other.
For completeness it is right to record that the United Kingdom United States Extradition Treaty 2003 (Cm 7146) contains the following specialty clause in article 18(1): A person extradited under this Treaty may not be detained, tried, or punished in the Requesting State except for: (a) any offense for which extradition was granted, or a different denominated offense based on the same facts as the offense on which the extradition was granted, provided such offense is extraditable, or is a lesser included offense Article 2.1 provides: An offense shall be an extraditable offense if the conduct on which the offense is based is punishable under the laws in both States by deprivation of liberty for a period of one year or more or by a more severe penalty.
Those provisions of the Treaty run in tandem with the Act but do not give rise to a separate argument.
The argument clearly and forcefully presented by Mr Jones depends for its persuasiveness on reading section 148 in isolation.
However, for a proper understanding of its purpose and construction it is necessary to see how the section fits into the structure of the Act.
Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Act each contains a definition of extradition offence, which have in common that they refer to conduct punishable with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment.
In Part 1 the relevant sections are 64 and 65; in Part 2 the relevant sections are sections 137 and 138.
The full definitions vary according to whether the extradition is outwards or inwards, the territories concerned, and whether the person subject to the proceedings has already been sentenced, but there is a common structure.
The Extradition Act 2003 replaced the Extradition Act 1989.
The need for new legislation arose from the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between member states (2002/584/JHA).
Those states are designated as category 1 territories under the 2003 Act, and Part 1 of the Act implements the Framework Decision in relation to arrest warrants issued by them.
The rationale of the Framework Decision is summarised in para (5) of the preamble: The objective set for the Union to become an area of freedom, security and justice leads to abolishing extradition between Member States and replacing it by a system of surrender between judicial authorities.
Further, the introduction of a new simplified system of surrender of sentenced or suspected persons for the purposes of execution or prosecution of criminal sentences makes it possible to remove the complexity and potential for delay inherent in the present extradition procedures.
Traditional co operation relations which have prevailed up till now between Member States should be replaced by a system of free movement of judicial decisions in criminal matters, covering both pre sentence and final decisions within an area of freedom, security and justice. [Emphasis added.]
Article 1.1 provides: The European Arrest Warrant is a judicial decision issued by a Member State with a view to the arrest and surrender by another Member State of a requested person, for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order. [Emphasis added.]
It follows that under the Framework Decision it is a prerequisite of a valid arrest warrant that the conduct of which the person is accused or has been convicted constitutes a criminal offence under the law of the requesting state.
The process by which Part 1 of the 2003 Act gives effect to the Framework Decision is linear, by which I mean that it sets out a series of stages and what is required at each stage.
Section 2 sets out the formal requirements of a European Arrest Warrant; it must specify the offence of which the person is accused or has been convicted.
Section 3 authorises the arrest of the person who is the subject of a European Arrest Warrant.
The arrested person must be brought before a judge within 48 hours (section 6).
If the judge is satisfied that the person brought before him is the subject of the arrest warrant, he must fix a date for the extradition hearing and deal with various procedural matters (section 8).
At the initial stage of the extradition hearing, section 10(2) requires the judge to decide whether the offence specified in the Part 1 warrant is an extradition offence.
In order to decide that question the judge must apply either section 64 or section 65.
Section 64 applies to a person who has not been sentenced, ie someone who has been accused but not tried or who has been convicted but not sentenced.
Section 65 applies to a person who is alleged to be unlawfully at large after conviction and has been sentenced for the offence.
The question whether the offence specified in the warrant is an extradition offence for the purposes of Part 1 depends on (a) the nature of the offence, in particular whether it is included in the European Framework list of extraditable offences or, if not, whether it would constitute an offence under the law of the United Kingdom if committed in the United Kingdom and (b) the length of the term of imprisonment to which the person either might be sentenced or has been sentenced.
Thus section 64 provides (in relation to a person not sentenced for the specified offence): (2) The conduct constitutes an extradition offence in relation to the category 1 territory if these conditions are satisfied (a) the conduct occurs in the category 1 territory and no part of it occurs in the United Kingdom; (b) a certificate issued by the appropriate authority of the category 1 territory shows that the conduct falls within the European framework list; (c) the certificate shows the conduct is punishable under the law of the category 1 territory with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 3 years or a greater punishment. (3) The conduct also constitutes an extradition offence in relation to the category 1 territory if these conditions are satisfied (a) the conduct occurs in the category 1 territory; (b) the conduct would constitute an offence under the law of the relevant part of the United Kingdom if it occurred in that part of the United Kingdom; (c) the conduct is punishable under the law of the category 1 territory with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment (however it is described in that law).
Section 65 contains analogous provisions in relation to sentenced offenders.
Extradition to non EU Member States with which the UK has extradition arrangements (category 2 territories) is governed by Part 2 of the 2003 Act.
The process begins with a request through diplomatic channels but the judicial process in the UK follows a similar pattern to that set out in Part 1.
At an initial stage the judge has to decide under section 78(4) whether the offence specified in the request for extradition is an extradition offence.
For that purpose the judge has to apply section 137 (in relation to a person who is accused of the offence or has been convicted but not sentenced) or section 138 (in relation to a person who has been sentenced for the offence).
Those sections closely resemble sections 64 and 65 in Part 1.
Thus section 137(2), which is the counterpart to section 64(2), provides: The conduct constitutes an extradition offence in relation to the category 2 territory if these conditions are satisfied (a) the conduct occurs in the category 2 territory; (b) the conduct would constitute an offence under the law of the relevant part of the United Kingdom punishable with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment if it occurred in that part of the United Kingdom; (c) the conduct is so punishable under the law of the category 2 territory (however it is described in that law).
The function of the definition of extradition offence in sections 64 and 65 of Part 1 and sections 137 and 138 of Part 2 is to differentiate between an offence for which a person may be extradited and one for which he may not.
To be an extradition offence, it must not only be a criminal offence but it must satisfy the prescribed criteria.
That accords not only with the scope of extradition under the Framework Decision but also with the essential nature of extradition as historically it has always been understood in the United Kingdom.
The Extradition Act 1870 (33 and 34 Vict, c 52) set out in the language of its preamble: the law relating to the surrender to foreign states of persons accused or convicted of the commission of certain crimes within the jurisdiction of such states, and to the trial of criminals surrendered by foreign states to this country.
Such persons were referred to in the Act as fugitive criminals.
The Extradition Act 1989 defined the term extradition crime as: Conduct in the territory of a foreign state.which, if it occurred in the United Kingdom, would constitute an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of 12 months, or any greater punishment, and which, however described in the law of the foreign state, is so punishable under that law.
The word offence in that definition clearly referred to a criminal offence because that was the word being defined.
The effect of the definition was to narrow the class of crimes constituting extradition crimes to those of sufficient seriousness to warrant extradition.
Similarly, section 2(1)(a) of the 1989 Act contained a definition of extradition crime in language which closely resembles section 137(2) of the 2003 Act.
There is a difference in the introductory words in that section 2(1) of the 1989 Act began with the words Extradition crime means, whereas section 137(2) of the 2003 Act begins with the words the conduct constitutes an extradition offenceif, but I would reject the idea that the change of wording reflects a subtle intention to widen the concept of an extradition offence so as to include non criminal conduct.
To change the law in that respect would have been a significant step which one would expect to have been highlighted at that time.
Part 3, under which the present appeal arises, is the reciprocal of Parts 1 and 2 in that it is concerned with extradition from category 1 and category 2 territories to the UK.
Extradition from a category 1 territory is a judicial process under the Framework Decision.
Sections 142 to 149 implement that process.
Under section 142 a judge may issue a part 3 warrant if satisfied among other things that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person has committed an extradition offence or that the person is unlawfully at large having been convicted of an extradition offence.
Section 148 applies in this context.
Section 148 has no direct application in relation to the extradition of a person from a category 2 territory, as in the present case, because the UK judiciary is not involved in the process of obtaining the extradition of a person from a category 2 territory.
The process of extradition from a category 2 territory is triggered not by a warrant issued by a UK judge but by a request from the Government to the foreign state.
For that reason sections 142 149 have no counterpart in relation to extradition from category 2 territories.
In any event, however, it is in my judgment clear for the reasons set out above that nothing can constitute an extradition offence (whether for the purposes of Part 1, Part 2 or Part 3) unless it is a criminal offence under the law of the relevant state.
Not every alleged criminal offence will amount to an extradition offence, but it is a necessary pre condition of an extradition offence that the conduct or alleged conduct is proscribed by the criminal law of the relevant state.
For those reasons I would reject Mr Joness principal argument.
Civil or criminal contempt
A restraint order under section 41 of POCA is an interim remedy.
Its aim is to prevent the disposal of realisable assets during a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings.
Under section 41(7) the court may make such order as it believes is appropriate for the purpose of insuring that the restraint order is effective.
This may include, for example, an order requiring disclosure of assets by the person against whom the restraint order is made.
A restraint order may also be reinforced by the appointment of a receiver under section 48 and the court may order any person who has possession of realisable property to which the restraint order applies to give possession of it to the receiver.
POCA does not provide that it is an offence to disobey or obstruct a restraint order or a receivership order, but the Crown Court has an inherent power to treat such behaviour as contempt of court, for which it may impose punishment under section 45 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.
Rule 59.6 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2013 (SI 2013/1554) provides that an applicant who wants the Crown Court to exercise that power must comply with the rules set out in part 62 (Contempt of Court).
There is a distinction long recognised in English law between civil contempt, ie conduct which is not in itself a crime but which is punishable by the court in order to ensure that its orders are observed, and criminal contempt.
Among modern authorities, the distinction was explained in general terms in Home Office v Harman [1983] 1 AC 280 (in particular by Lord Scarman at p 310) and Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd [1992] 1 AC 191 (in particular by Lord Oliver at pp 217 218).
Breach of an order made (or undertaking obtained) in the course of legal proceedings may result in punishment of the person against whom the order was made (or from whom the undertaking was obtained) as a form of contempt.
As Lord Oliver observed in Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd, although the intention with which the person acted will be relevant to the question of penalty, the liability is strict in the sense that all that is required to be proved is the service of the order and the subsequent doing by the party bound of that which was prohibited (or failure to do that which was ordered).
However, a contempt of that kind does not constitute a criminal offence.
Although the penalty contains a punitive element, its primary purpose is to make the order of the court effective.
A person who commits this type of contempt does not acquire a criminal record.
A criminal contempt is conduct which goes beyond mere non compliance with a court order or undertaking and involves a serious interference with the administration of justice.
Examples include physically interfering with the course of a trial, threatening witnesses or publishing material likely to prejudice a fair trial.
The distinction is not unique to English law.
A similar distinction is recognised in the U.S.A.
In Turner v Rogers 564 US 1 (2011) the US Supreme Court had to decide whether the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution granted an indigent defendant a right to state appointed counsel in civil contempt proceedings which might lead to his imprisonment.
Justice Breyer, at page 8, said that civil contempt differs from criminal contempt in that it seeks only to coerce the defendant to do what the court had ordered him previously to do.
If a victim of the appellants fraud had obtained a freezing order against him similar to the restraint order made under section 41 of POCA, there is no doubt that the claimant would have been entitled to bring contempt proceedings against the appellant after his extradition to the United Kingdom.
The case would be analogous to Pooley v Whetham (1880) LR 15 Ch D435.
An order was made in litigation between Mr Pooley and a bank that Mr Pooley was to give up possession of certain property to a receiver and manager appointed by the court.
Mr Pooley disobeyed the order and went to Paris, where he was arrested under a warrant issued under the Extradition Act 1870 for an alleged offence of fraud.
After his return Mr Pooley was acquitted for the fraud for which he had been extradited to stand trial, but the bank sought to proceed against him for his earlier contempt.
It was argued unsuccessfully on his behalf that the proceedings contravened section 19 of the 1870 Act, which provided that a person who was arrested under the Act should not be triable or tried for any offence committed prior to his arrest other than a crime for which the surrender was granted.
The Court of Appeal held that the process instituted by the bank was not a proceeding for punishing a crime.
It was a process for the purpose of enforcing civil rights.
Mr Jones submitted that the position is different with a restraint order under section 41, because it is not an order obtained in order to protect an applicants civil rights but is an order obtained by the state in the course of a criminal investigation.
The Common Serjeant and the Court of Appeal rejected this argument and I agree with them.
It is necessary to look at the nature and purpose of the order.
It is fallacious to argue that because the order was made by a criminal court, rather than a civil court, disobedience to the order amounts to a crime, whereas it would not have been a crime to disobey a similar order imposed by a civil court.
The question whether a contempt is a criminal contempt does not depend on the nature of the court to which the contempt was displayed; it depends on nature of the conduct.
To burst into a court room and disrupt a civil trial would be a criminal contempt just as much as if the court had been conducting a criminal trial.
Conversely, disobedience to a procedural order of a court is not in itself a crime, just because the order was made in the course of criminal proceedings.
To hold that a breach of a procedural order made in a criminal court is itself a crime would be to introduce an unjustified and anomalous extension of the criminal law.
Civil contempt is not confined to contempt of a civil court.
It simply denotes a contempt which is not itself a crime.
Conclusion
I would dismiss the appeal and would answer the questions certified by the (i) a contempt of court constituted by a breach of a restraint order made under section 41 of POCA is not itself a crime. (ii) section 151A of the Extradition Act 2003 and article 18 of the United Kingdom United States Extradition Treaty 2003 do not preclude a court from dealing with the person for such a contempt when that person has been extradited to the United Kingdom in respect of criminal offences.
Court of Appeal as follows:
","This appeal concerns the principle that an individual extradited to the UK to face trial may only be tried for crimes allegedly committed before the extradition if those crimes form the basis of the extradition request (the specialty principle), and its application to contempt of court proceedings.
In 2009 Mr OBrien came under investigation on suspicion of involvement in a large scale scheme to defraud investors, commonly known as a boiler room fraud.
On 24 September 2009 the Common Serjeant of London made a restraint order against him under section 41 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).
This order required Mr OBrien (amongst other things) to make disclosure of his assets, not to remove assets from England and Wales, and to return to England and Wales within 21 days any moveable asset in which he had an interest outside England and Wales.
The order contained a penal notice, warning Mr OBrien that if he disobeyed the order he could be found to be in contempt of court.
Mr OBrien disobeyed the order and fled to the United States.
On 18 December 2009 the Common Serjeant found that he was in contempt and issued a bench warrant for his arrest.
Mr OBrien was traced to Chicago.
The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) sought his extradition to face charges relating to the alleged boiler room fraud.
Mr OBrien consented to his extradition on 8 October 2010.
Since there was a concern that the outstanding bench warrant could complicate the extradition, the SFO applied to the Common Serjeant to set aside the bench warrant, which he did on 18 November 2010.
Mr OBrien was returned to the UK on 2 December 2010.
He was arrested, charged with various fraud offences, and remanded in custody.
Meanwhile the SFO had reviewed its concerns about the contempt allegation, and re applied to the Common Serjeant for Mr OBriens committal for contempt.
Mr OBrien challenged the courts jurisdiction to hear the application.
That challenge was rejected by the Common Serjeant and by the Court of Appeal.
Mr OBrien now appeals to the Supreme Court on two grounds, namely that: On the correct construction of the Extradition Act 2003, the specialty rule applies to any extradition offence, defined as conduct occurring in the UK and punishable under the law of the UK with imprisonment or detention for 12 months or more (by reference to sections 148 and 151A of the Extradition Act 2003 (the 2003 Act)).
Mr OBriens contempt satisfies these criteria and so falls within the specialty rule; or In the alternative, Mr OBriens contempt of court is a criminal contempt constituting a criminal offence, and so falls within the specialty rule.
The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.
The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Toulson.
On the first issue, the Court holds that section 151A does not directly apply to this case [34 35].
In any event, the sections relied upon by Mr OBrien cannot be read in isolation, and reading the Act as a whole it is clear
that conduct constituting an extradition offence must be a criminal offence under the law of the requesting state (here the UK) [36].
On the second issue, the Court holds that there is a material distinction between civil and criminal contempt.
The latter involves a serious interference with the administration of justice [41].
The former is an inherent power used by a senior court in order to ensure that its orders are observed.
Its primary purpose is to ensure that the courts orders are observed, and the contemnor does not acquire a criminal record [39 40].
In this case Mr OBriens disobedience to the Common Serjeants order constitutes civil contempt, which does not constitute an extradition offence [45].
First Ground: Mr OBrien argued that if his contempt satisfied the definition of extradition offence in section 148 of the 2003 Act, section 151A precluded a United Kingdom court dealing with him for that contempt [14 16].
Mr OBriens argument required reading these two sections in isolation.
However, it is necessary to see how those sections fit into the structure of the 2003 Act [20].
Each of Parts 1 3 of the 2003 Act contain a similar definition of extradition offence, in each case referring to conduct punishable with imprisonment or another form of detention for a term of 12 months or a greater punishment, with a common structure across the definitions [21].
The Extradition Act 1989 was replaced by the 2003 Act in order to implement, in Part 1 of the 2003 Act, an EU Framework Decision [22].
Under the Framework Decision, it is a prerequisite of a valid arrest warrant that the conduct of which the person is accused or has been convicted constitutes a criminal offence under the law of the requesting state [25].
In relation to Part 1 (dealing with extradition from the UK to other Member States), the definition of extradition offence accordingly requires that an offence either be a listed extraditable offence or an offence under the law of the United Kingdom [28].
A similar scheme is in place in relation to extradition from the UK to those non EU countries with which the UK has extradition arrangements, governed by Part 2 of the 2003 Act.
So, sections 137 and 138 of the 2003 Act require that an extradition offence concerns conduct which would constitute an offence under UK law [29 30].
That accords with the essential nature of extradition as it has been understood in the UK [31 33].
Part 3 of the 2003 Act deals with extradition to the UK. section 148 (within Part 3) has no direct application to this case, since the UK judiciary is not involved in the process of obtaining Mr OBriens extradition [35].
Nonetheless section 151A should be understood in the light of the wider scheme of the 2003 Act.
It is clear that nothing can constitute an extradition offence unless it is a criminal offence under the relevant state, here the UK [36].
Second Ground: A restraint order under POCA is an interim remedy, aiming to prevent the disposal of realisable assets during a criminal investigation.
The Crown Court has an inherent jurisdiction to treat breach of such orders as contempt of court [37 38].
There is a well recognised distinction between criminal contempt, covering conduct itself a crime, and civil contempt, covering conduct which is not itself a crime but is punishable by the court in order that the courts orders be observed.
A civil contemnor does not receive a criminal record [39 41].
If a victim of Mr OBriens fraud had obtained a freezing order against him similar to the POCA restraint order and Mr OBrien had disobeyed and absconded, the victim would clearly have been able to bring contempt proceedings following his extradition [43].
There is no relevant difference with a POCA order.
The key is the nature and purpose of the order, not the court in which the order was made [44].
Mr OBriens contempt was civil, and his committal is not barred by the specialty principle.
"
uksc-2015-0255,"This appeal concerns the lawfulness of a proposal by the Lord Chancellor (then The Rt Hon Christopher Grayling MP) in September 2013 to introduce a residence test for civil legal aid by amending Schedule 1 to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO), by means of delegated legislation, in the form of a statutory instrument, which I will refer to as the draft order.
Part 1 of LASPO
In November 2010, the Ministry of Justice published a consultation paper entitled Proposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales.
Following the subsequent public consultation exercise, the Ministry published a paper entitled Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales: the Government Response in June 2011.
The proposals in this June 2011 paper were then largely reflected in a Bill which was put before Parliament, and which, subject to amendments, was enacted as LASPO, a statute which was enacted on 1 May 2012.
As its title suggests, LASPO is concerned with a number of different areas of the legal system.
This case is concerned with Part 1 of LASPO, which came into force on 1 April 2013, is entitled Legal Aid, and contains 43 sections.
Sections 1 to 12 are headed Provision of legal aid.
Sections 8 to 12 are concerned with civil legal services, and sections 13 to 20 with Criminal legal aid.
Sections 21 and 22 are concerned with Financial resources, sections 23 to 26 with Contributions and costs, and sections 27 to 30 with Providers of services etc.
Sections 31 to 43 are Supplementary provisions.
Section 1(1) of LASPO imposes on the Lord Chancellor a duty to secure that legal aid is made available in accordance with this Part, and section 1(4) enables him to do anything to further those functions.
Section 2(1) empowers him to make such arrangements as [he] considers appropriate to carry out those functions, and section 3 is concerned with standards of service.
Section 4(1) requires the Lord Chancellor to appoint a Director of Legal Aid Casework, defined as the Director.
Section 8 defines civil legal services as the provision of legal advice and assistance as to the law, proceedings, disputes and enforcement other than in connection with criminal matters.
Section 9 of LASPO is entitled General cases, and it provides: (1) Civil legal services are to be available to an individual under this Part if they are civil legal services described in Part 1 of (a) Schedule 1, and (b) the Director has determined that the individual qualifies for the services in accordance with this Part (2) The Lord Chancellor may by order add services to Part 1 of Schedule 1, or (a) (b) vary or omit services described in that Part, (whether by modifying that Part or Parts 2, 3 or 4 of the Schedule).
Section 10 of LASPO deals with Exceptional cases, in respect of which civil legal services are to be available even though they would not be available under section 9.
It includes, in subsection (3), cases where the denial of civil legal services would be a breach of [an] individuals Convention rights or EU rights.
Section 11 of LASPO is entitled Qualifying for civil legal aid.
Section 11(1) requires the Director to determine whether an individual qualifies for civil legal services by reference to (a) his financial resources (as defined in section 21 and regulations under that section), and (b) criteria set out in regulations.
Section 11(2) provides that, in setting the criteria under section 11(1)(b), the Lord Chancellor (a) must consider the circumstances in which it is appropriate to make civil legal services available, and (b) must, in particular, consider the extent to which the criteria ought to reflect the factors set out in subsection (3).
The ten factors set out in section 11(3) include (a) the likely cost and likely benefit of providing the services, (b) the availability of resources, (e) the nature and the seriousness of the case, (f) the availability of alternative services, (g) the prospects of success, (h) the conduct of the individual concerned in connection with services made available under this Part, and (j) the public interest.
subsections (1), (2) and (3) are in these terms: Section 41 of LASPO is headed Orders, regulations and directions, and (1) Orders, regulations and directions under this Part (a) may make different provision for different cases, circumstances or areas, (b) may make provision generally or only for specified cases, circumstances or areas, and (c) may make provision having effect for a period specified or described in the order, regulations or direction. (2) They may, in particular, make provision by reference to services provided for the purposes of (a) proceedings before a particular court, tribunal or other person, (b) individual, or (c) services provided for individuals selected by reference to particular criteria or on a sampling basis. services provided for a particular class of (3) Orders and regulations under this Part (a) may provide for a person to exercise a discretion in dealing with any matter, (b) may make provision by reference to a document produced by any person, and (c) may make consequential, supplementary, incidental, transitional or saving provision.
Section 41(6) provides that a statutory instrument containing an order made under any section mentioned in section 41(7) may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament, and section 41(7) included, in para (a), orders under section 9.
Schedule 1 to LASPO is headed Civil Legal Services and Part 1 sets out the Services, which are referred to in section 9(1)(a).
Over 40 categories are set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1, and almost all of them begin with the words Civil legal services provided either to or in relation to.
They include care, supervision and protection of children (para 1), special educational needs (para 2), and abuse of an individual when a child or a vulnerable adult, but only where (a) the services are provided to the individual (para 3).
The categories also include appeals relating to welfare benefits (para 8), victims of domestic violence and family matters (para 12), and judicial review, save where such review will produce no benefit to the individual concerned (para 19).
Other categories are breach of Convention rights by a public authority (para 22), certain specified immigration matters (paras 24 31), loss of home and homelessness (paras 33 and 34), protection from harassment (para 37), in relation to a sexual offence, but only where (a) the services are provided to the victim of the offence (para 39).
Also, inquests (para 41), environmental pollution (para 42), and equality (para 43).
Some of these paragraphs are fairly detailed and include exclusions and definitions.
Part 2 of Schedule 1 is entitled Excluded services, and it is introduced with the following words, The services described in Part 1 of this Schedule do not include the services listed in this Part of this Schedule, except to the extent that Part 1 of this Schedule provides otherwise.
Part 2 contains 18 paragraphs, and (with the exception of para 14) they all begin with the words Civil legal services provided in relation to, and then refer to specific areas, including personal injury or death (para 1), a claim in tort in respect of negligence (para 2), damage to property (para 6), a claim in tort in respect of breach of statutory duty (para 8) and a benefit, allowance, payment, credit or pension under certain statutes (para 15).
Paragraph 14 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 is Civil legal services provided to an individual in relation to matters arising out of establishing, carrying on, or terminating a business.
Part 3 of Schedule 1 is concerned with Advocacy: exclusion and exceptions, and it sets out tribunals before which advocacy is within the Services covered by Part 1 of the Schedule.
Part 4 of that Schedule is concerned with Interpretation.
The draft order
In April 2013, the Ministry of Justice issued a paper, Transforming Legal Aid, and subsequently carried out a public consultation exercise in connection with its proposals.
In September 2013, the Ministry published its response to the results of that exercise, Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps.
In the September 2013 paper, the Ministry stated at para 132 that, subject to certain specified exceptions: [T]he Government has decided to proceed with the introduction of a residence test in civil legal aid so that only those who are: lawfully resident in the UK, Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories at the time the application for civil legal aid was made; and have resided lawfully in the UK, Crown Dependencies or British Overseas territories for a continuous period of at least 12 months at any point in the past
would be eligible for civil legal aid
The specified exceptions were (i) serving members of the armed forces and their families, (ii) asylum seekers, and (iii) in relation to the second bullet point, children aged under 12 months.
No exception was to be made for older children who were not responsible for their lack of lawful resident status.
The Ministry later agreed to exclude certain classes of case from the ambit of this proposal, namely categories of case which broadly relate to an individuals liberty, where the individual is particularly vulnerable, or where the case relates to the protection of children.
In its September 2013 paper, the Ministry described the proposal as justified and proportionate, and pointed out that anyone excluded by the residence test would be entitled to apply for exceptional funding.
In para 6.3 of an Equality Statement attached to that paper, the Ministry described the primary objective of the proposal as being to bear down on the cost of legal aid, ensuring that every aspect of expenditure is justified and that we are getting the best deal for the taxpayer, and further stated that the reforms seek to promote public confidence in the system by ensuring limited public resources are targeted at those cases which justify it and those people who need it.
Also in September 2013, the Lord Chancellor decided to proceed with his proposal described in paras 12 and 13 above, and to give effect to that decision by laying a draft order before Parliament.
The draft order was put before Parliament on 31 March 2014.
The draft order stated that it was made pursuant to sections 9(2)(b), 41(1)(a) and (b), 41(2)(a) and (b), and 41(3)(b) and (c) of LASPO.
The draft order effectively provides that an individual who fails the residence test would no longer qualify for civil legal aid for any types of claim, subject to certain limited exceptions.
The effect of the draft order was to insert a new para 19 into Part 2 of Schedule 1, whose effect was explained by Moses LJ in the Divisional Court at [2015] 1 WLR 251, paras 21 24, and was more shortly summarised by Mr Eadie QC, who appeared for the Lord Chancellor, in a description adopted by Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal at para 8: To satisfy the residence test, an individual would have to be lawfully resident in the UK, the Channel Islands, Isle of Man or a British Overseas Territory on the day the application for civil legal services was made, and (unless they were under 12 months old or a particular kind of asylum claimant or involved with the UK Armed Forces) have been so lawfully resident for a 12 month period at some time in the past (excluding absences of up to 30 days).
There were proposed exceptions to the test.
Claimants pursuing certain types of proceedings were not required to satisfy the test (for example, domestic violence cases, and challenges to the lawfulness of detention).
In any event, regardless of residence, a claimant who failed the residence test would have been entitled to apply for legal aid under the Exceptional Case Funding regime in section l0 of LASPO whose purpose is to ensure that all those who have a right to legal aid under the European Convention or EU law are able to obtain it.
The instant proceedings
Before the draft order had been laid before Parliament, Public Law Project (PLP) applied to the High Court for a declaration that it would be unlawful.
The alleged unlawfulness was based on two grounds, namely that the draft order was or would be (i) ultra vires, ie outside the scope of the power granted to the Lord Chancellor in LASPO to bring forward delegated legislation, and (ii) unjustifiably discriminatory in its effect.
The Divisional Court, in a judgment given by Moses LJ (with whom Collins and Jay JJ agreed), held that the draft order was unlawful on both grounds [2015] 1 WLR 251.
As the draft order was before Parliament at the time of the decision of the Divisional Court, it was withdrawn, and that remains the position today.
The Lord Chancellor appealed against both conclusions reached by the Divisional Court.
The Court of Appeal, in a judgment given by Laws LJ (with whom Kitchin and Christopher Clarke LJJ agreed), allowed his appeal, holding that the draft order was intra vires and, while it was discriminatory in its effect, the discrimination could be justified [2016] 2 WLR 995.
PLP now appeals to this court, and maintains both the ultra vires and the discrimination arguments.
The ultra vires principle in the present context
The draft order, once formally made, would, of course, be secondary, or subordinate, legislation, unlike LASPO itself which, as a statute, is primary legislation.
Primary legislation is initiated by a Bill which is placed before Parliament.
To the extent that Parliament considers it appropriate, all or any of the provisions of a Bill can be subject to detailed scrutiny, discussion, and amendment in Parliament before being formally enacted as primary legislation; it is then formally approved by the monarch, whereupon it becomes a statute.
In our system of parliamentary supremacy (subject to arguable extreme exceptions, which I hope and expect will never have to be tested in practice), it is not open to a court to challenge or refuse to apply a statute, save to the extent that Parliament authorises or requires a court to do so.
Subordinate legislation consists of legislation made by members of the Executive (often, as in this case, by Government ministers), almost always pursuant to an authority given by Parliament in primary legislation.
The draft order in the present case would be a statutory instrument, which is a type of subordinate legislation which must be laid in draft before Parliament.
Some statutory instruments are subject to the negative resolution procedure ie they will become law unless, within a specified period, they are debated and voted down.
Other statutory instruments, such as the draft order in this case, are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure ie they can only become law if they are formally approved by Parliament see subsections (6) and (7)(a) of section 41.
Although they can be said to have been approved by Parliament, draft statutory instruments, even those subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, are not subject to the same legislative scrutiny as bills; and, unlike bills, they cannot be amended by Parliament.
Accordingly, it is well established that, unlike statutes, the lawfulness of statutory instruments (like other subordinate legislation) can be challenged in court.
As Lord Diplock said in F Hoffmann La Roche & Co v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295, 365, even though [subordinate legislation] is contained in an order made by statutory instrument approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, I entertain no doubt that the courts have jurisdiction to declare it to be invalid if they are satisfied that in making it the Minister who did so acted outwith the legislative powers conferred upon him by the Act of Parliament under which the order [was] purported to be made .
Subordinate legislation will be held by a court to be invalid if it has an effect, or is made for a purpose, which is ultra vires, that is, outside the scope of the statutory power pursuant to which it was purportedly made.
In declaring subordinate legislation to be invalid in such a case, the court is upholding the supremacy of Parliament over the Executive.
That is because the court is preventing a member of the Executive from making an order which is outside the scope of the power which Parliament has given him or her by means of the statute concerned.
Accordingly, when, as in this case, it is contended that actual or intended subordinate legislation is ultra vires, it is necessary for a court to determine the scope of the statutorily conferred power to make that legislation.
Normally, statutory provisions which provide for subordinate legislation are concerned with subsidiary issues such as procedural rules, practice directions, and forms of notice; hence statutory instruments are frequently referred to as regulations.
However, such statutory provisions sometimes permit more substantive issues to be covered by subordinate legislation, and, as is the case with section 9(2)(b) of LASPO, they sometimes permit subordinate legislation which actually amends the statute concerned (or even another statute), by addition, deletion or variation.
As explained in Craies on Legislation (10th ed (2015)), edited by Daniel Greenberg), para 1.3.9: The term Henry VIII power is commonly used to describe a delegated power under which subordinate legislation is enabled to amend primary legislation.
When a court is considering the validity of a statutory instrument made under a Henry VIII power, its role in upholding Parliamentary supremacy is particularly striking, as the statutory instrument will be purporting to vary primary legislation passed into law by Parliament.
The interpretation of the statutory provision conferring a power to make secondary legislation is, of course, to be effected in accordance with normal principles of statutory construction.
However, in the case of an amendment that is permitted under a Henry VIII power, to quote again from Craies (op cit) para 1.3.11: as with all delegated powers the only rule for construction is to test each proposed exercise by reference to whether or not it is within the class of action that Parliament must have contemplated when delegating.
Although Henry VIII powers are often cast in very wide terms, the more general the words by Parliament to delegate a power, the more likely it is that an exercise within the literal meaning of the words will nevertheless be outside the legislatures contemplation.
In two cases, R v Secretary of State for Social Security, Ex p Britnell [1991] 1 WLR 198, 204 and R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Ex p Spath Holme Ltd [2001] 2 AC 349, 383, the House of Lords has cited with approval the following observation of Lord Donaldson MR in McKiernon v Secretary of State for Social Security, The Times, November 1989; Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Transcript No 1017 of 1989, which is to much the same effect: Whether subject to the negative or affirmative resolution procedure, [subordinate legislation] is subject to much briefer, if any, examination by Parliament and cannot be amended.
The duty of the courts being to give effect to the will of Parliament, it is, in my judgment, legitimate to take account of the fact that a delegation to the Executive of power to modify primary legislation must be an exceptional course and that, if there is any doubt about the scope of the power conferred upon the Executive or upon whether it has been exercised, it should be resolved by a restrictive approach.
Immediately after quoting this passage in Spath Holme, Lord Bingham went on to say [r]ecognition of Parliaments primary law making role in my view requires such an approach.
He went on to add that, where there is little room for doubt about the scope of the power in the statute concerned, it is not for the courts to cut down that scope by some artificial reading of the power.
Is the draft order ultra vires?
The argument that the draft order is ultra vires the powers granted to the Lord Chancellor is, in essence, as follows.
The exclusion of a specific group of people from the right to receive civil legal services in relation to an issue, on the ground of personal circumstances or characteristics (namely those not lawfully resident in the UK, Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories) which have nothing to do with the nature of the issue or services involved or the individuals need, or ability to pay, for the services, is simply not within the scope of the power accorded to the Lord Chancellor by section 9(2)(b) of LASPO, and nothing in section 41 undermines that contention.
In my view, that argument is sound, and should be accepted.
Turning to section 9(2)(b) itself, as a matter of ordinary language, the relevant parts of the draft order do not seek to vary or omit services: rather they seek to reduce the class of individuals who are entitled to receive those services by reference to a personal characteristic or circumstance unrelated to the services.
Of course, the words of section 9(2)(b) have to be interpreted in their context, and I accept that a sufficiently clear and strong context could justify a different conclusion, in the sense that the words of section 9(2)(b) could, as a matter of language, just about extend to a regulation such as the draft order.
Nonetheless, that is not their natural meaning, and, of course, the natural meaning of the words in question is an important factor in an issue of statutory interpretation, particularly when they suggest that a so called Henry VIII power does not extend to authorise the subordinate legislation in question.
When one turns to the wider statutory context, I consider that it supports, rather than undermines, the conclusion indicated by the natural meaning of the words of section 9(2)(b) on their own.
First, section 9(2)(b) permits a variation or omission of the services set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1, by, inter alia, modifying that Part or Part 2 of that Schedule.
Each of the services identified in Part 1 and Part 2 is linked to a specific type of legal issue or claim, and has nothing to do with the personal circumstances or characteristics, and in particular the geographical residence, of the potential recipient of the services, other than those which relate to the issue or the services concerned.
The point is well demonstrated by the fact that, as mentioned in para 10 above, all the existing 18 paragraphs of Part 2 of the Schedule are concerned with Civil legal services provided in relation to specified areas of litigation, whereas the new proposed para 19 will have nothing to do with any specified area of litigation at all.
It is true that, as mentioned in para 9 above, some provisions, such as paras 3(a) and 39(a) of Part 1, limit the right to receive legal services to one specific group, namely the victims of alleged wrongdoing, and exclude, for instance, the alleged perpetrators.
However, that does not in any way undermine PLPs case, because the objection to the draft order is that it excludes (albeit subject to exceptions) a group of individuals on grounds which have nothing to do with the issue or services involved.
This conclusion is supported by the contrast in the wording of the two subsections of section 9.
Subsection (1) states that [c]ivil legal services are to be available to an individual if (a) they are civil legal services described in Part 1 of Schedule 1, and (b) the Director determines that the individual qualifies for the services.
Thus, subsection (1) clearly distinguishes between the question whether the particular services qualify para (a) and whether the particular individual qualifies para (b).
When one turns to the subsection under which the draft order in the present case is said to have been made, both para (a) and para (b) of subsection (2) refer only to services within Part 1 of Schedule 1.
The natural inference from this is that subsection (2) is concerned with adding to, varying or omitting services, and not the individuals to whom the services may be provided.
Looking elsewhere in LASPO, whereas section 9, the section under which the draft order was purportedly made, is concerned with the issues in respect of which civil legal services are to be available, section 11 of LASPO is the provision which appears to be concerned with identifying the characteristics or circumstances of individuals who are to qualify for civil legal aid.
Section 11 gives rise to two points in favour of PLPs case.
First, the very fact that it is that section which sets out the personal characteristics or circumstances of those individuals who are entitled to civil legal aid provides obvious support that such matters are outwith section 9.
Secondly, the factors listed in section 11(1) or (3), some of which are described in para 7 above, are concerned with criteria which are connected to the need of the individual for the services, the cost of the services, the extent and likelihood of the benefit from those services and the conduct of the individual in connection with the services.
There is no criterion which is based on personal characteristics or circumstances which have nothing to do with the issue involved, the services concerned, or the need of the individual concerned for financial assistance. (It is true that public interest, mentioned in section 11(3)(j), would be capable in some contexts of extending to personal characteristics or circumstances, but, read in their context, those words cannot have such an effect in section 11(3), and it was not argued otherwise.) This suggests that the draft order is attempting to do something which the legislature never had in mind when enacting Part 1 of LASPO, let alone section 9.
As Lord Carnwath mentioned, that point is underlined by the strong presumption that, as it is put in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation 6th ed (2013), section 129, an enactment applies to foreigners within its territory as it applies to persons within that territory belonging to it.
It was conceded on behalf of the Lord Chancellor that he could not have made the draft order under section 11.
Given that that section is concerned with prescribing the characteristics and circumstances of those who should be able to qualify for civil legal services, it seems to me that that concession tends of itself to provide additional support for PLPs contention that the Lord Chancellor cannot make such an order under section 9.
The Court of Appeal concluded that section 41, and in particular section 41(2)(b), could be invoked to defeat this contention.
It is true that section 41(2)(b) permits any order made under section 9(2)(b) to make provision by reference to services provided for a particular class of individual.
However, I cannot accept that this means that the power to make orders under section 9(2)(b) is thereby extended to exclude a whole class of individuals from the scope of Part 1 of LASPO by reference to their residence.
Section 41 is clearly intended to grant ancillary powers to those powers which are, as it were, primarily granted by provisions such as section 9: it is not intended to permit an alteration in the nature, or a substantive extension, of those powers.
The observations in Craies, cited in para 26 above, is very much in point.
In my view, in relation to his powers under section 9(2), section 41(2)(b) enables the Lord Chancellor to make limitations such as those already found in paras 3(a) and 39(a) of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to LASPO, and explained in para 8 above.
Finally, looking at the issue more broadly, it is said that one of the main purposes of Part 1 of LASPO was to reduce the availability of legal aid in connection with legal advice and representation in relation to civil claims, and that this is also the reason for the draft order.
It is also said that one of the aims of the provisions of sections 9 and 11 of, and Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 to, LASPO is to direct legal aid to what are believed to be the individuals who, and types of claim which, are most deserving of public support, and that the draft order has that aim too.
However, even if they are right (which in a broad sense I think they are), those contentions involve expressing the aim of the legislation in far too general terms to justify rejecting PLPs case.
As is apparent from sections 9 and 11 themselves, and from the Ministry of Justices June 2011 paper referred to in para 2 above, the purpose of Part 1 of LASPO was, in very summary terms, to channel civil legal aid on the basis of the nature and importance of the issue, an individuals need for financial support, the availability of other funding, and the availability of other forms of dispute resolution.
The exclusion of individuals from the scope of most areas of civil legal aid on the ground that they do not satisfy the residence requirements of the proposed order involves a wholly different sort of criterion from those embodied in LASPO and articulated in the 2011 paper.
Conclusion
Accordingly, in agreement with the Divisional Court, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed on the first, ultra vires, issue.
We had unanimously come to this view at the end of the argument on the ultra vires issue, and decided that, subject to the parties seeking to persuade us otherwise, it would be wiser not to deal with the discrimination issue.
The parties did not seek to dissuade us from this course, and therefore it would be inappropriate to say anything more about it.
","This appeal concerns the legality of attempts by the Lord Chancellor to introduce a residence test for civil legal aid by amending the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO).
Part 1 of LASPO came into force on 1 April 2013.
It includes section 9, subsection (1) of which provides that civil legal services are to be available to an individual if they are legal services described in Part 1 of Schedule 1, and the Director of Legal Aid Casework has determined that the individual qualifies for the services in accordance with Part 1 of LASPO.
Part 1 of Schedule 1 accordingly sets out the services for which civil legal aid is available.
Subsection 9(2) permits the Lord Chancellor to (a) add to, and (b) vary or omit services in Part 1 of the Schedule.
In April 2013, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) issued a paper in which it stated that, subject to certain specific exceptions, the Government would proceed with the introduction of a residence test so that only those who are lawfully resident in the UK (or Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories) at the time of the application and have so resided for a continuous period of at least 12 months at any point in the past would be eligible for civil legal aid.
In September 2013, the Lord Chancellor decided to proceed with the proposal and to make regulations to that effect in the form of delegated legislation (the draft order), which was put before Parliament on 31 March 2014.
Before the draft order was laid before Parliament, the Public Law Project applied to the High Court for a declaration that the draft order was unlawful on the basis that it was (i) ultra vires, i.e. outside the scope of the power granted to the Lord Chancellor by LASPO to bring forward delegated legislation; and (ii) unjustifiably discriminatory in its effect.
The Divisional Court held that the draft order was unlawful on both grounds.
Following the decision of the Divisional Court, the Lord Chancellor withdrew the draft order before any debate in the House of Lords could take place.
On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the Lord Chancellors appeal on both grounds, holding that the draft order was intra vires and that, while it was discriminatory in its effect, the discrimination could be justified.
The Public Law Project now appeal to the Supreme Court on both grounds.
Following a hearing at which the Court heard argument on the ultra vires issue and indicated that it did not need to hear argument on the discrimination issue, the Supreme Court unanimously allows the
Public Law Projects appeal on the ultra vires issue.
Lord Neuberger gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.
The Public Law Project contend that the exclusion of a specific group of people from the right to receive legal services on the ground of personal circumstances or characteristics, which have nothing to do with the nature of the issue or services involved or the individuals need, or ability to pay, for the services, is not within the scope of the power accorded to the Lord Chancellor by section 9(2)(b) of LASPO, and that nothing in section 41 undermines that contention.
That argument is accepted by the Court [30].
In declaring subordinate legislation to be outside the scope of the statutory power pursuant to which it was purportedly made, the Court is upholding the supremacy of Parliament over the Executive [23].
Section 9(2)(b) provides a power to vary or omit services, but the relevant parts of the draft order do not seek to vary or omit services; rather, they seek to reduce the class of individuals who are entitled to receive those services by reference to a personal characteristics or circumstance unrelated to the services (i.e. length of residency) [30].
This interpretation of the wording of section 9(2) is supported by the wider statutory context.
Each of the services identified in Part 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 1 is linked to a specific type of legal issue or claim, and has nothing to do with the personal circumstances or characteristics in particular the geographical residence of the potential recipient of the services [31].
This conclusion is also supported by contrasting the wording of the two subsections of section 9.
Subsection (1) clearly distinguishes between the question of whether the particular services qualify and whether the particular individual qualifies [33].
Section 9(2) is concerned with the services which qualify, and it is section 11 which appears to be concerned with identifying the characteristics or circumstances of individuals who are to qualify for civil legal aid.
The criteria that section 11 sets out all relate to the issue involved, the services concerned, or the need of the individual for financial assistance, in contrast to the draft order.
This indicates that the draft order is attempting to do something which the legislature never had in mind when enacting section 9 [34].
The Court of Appeal concluded that section 41 could be invoked to defeat the contention that the Lord Chancellor could not make the draft order under section 9.
While it is true that section 41(2)(b) permits any order made under section 9(2)(b) to make provision by reference to services provided for a particular class of individual, this cannot extend the power under section 9(2)(b) so as to exclude a whole class of individuals from the scope of Part 1 of LASPO by reference to their residence [36].
Section 41 is clearly intended to grant ancillary powers to those primarily granted under section 9 [36].
Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed on the first, ultra vires, issue, and the Court does not have to deal with the discrimination issue [39].
"
uksc-2018-0164,"The law of vicarious liability is on the move.
So stated Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers in Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56; [2013] 2 AC 1, generally known as Christian Brothers, at para 19.
The question raised by the current case, and by the parallel case of WM Morrison Supermarkets plc v Various Claimants [2020] UKSC 12, is how far that move can take it.
Two elements have to be shown before one person can be made vicariously liable for the torts committed by another.
The first is a relationship between the two persons which makes it proper for the law to make the one pay for the fault of the other.
Historically, and leaving aside relationships such as agency and partnership, that was limited to the relationship between employer and employee, but that has now been somewhat broadened.
That is the subject matter of this case.
The second is the connection between that relationship and the tortfeasors wrongdoing.
Historically, the tort had to be committed in the course or within the scope of the tortfeasors employment, but that too has now been somewhat broadened.
That is the subject matter of the Morrisons case.
The facts
The issue before us is whether Barclays Bank is vicariously liable for the sexual assaults allegedly committed between 1968 and about 1984 by the late Dr Gordon Bates on some 126 claimants in this group action.
Dr Bates was a medical practitioner practising in Newcastle upon Tyne.
According to his sons evidence, he had a portfolio practice.
Some of it was as an employee in local hospitals.
Some of it was doing medical examinations for emigration purposes.
Some of it was doing miscellaneous work for insurance companies, a mining company and a government board.
Some of it was doing medical assessments and examinations of employees or prospective employees, originally for Martins Bank, and later for Barclays Bank following their merger in 1969.
This was, however, a comparatively minor part of his practice.
He also wrote a newspaper column.
Applicants for jobs at Barclays who were successful at interview would be told that they would be offered a job, subject to passing a medical examination and obtaining satisfactory results in their GCE examinations.
The purpose of the examination was to show that they were medically fit for working in the Bank and could be recommended for life insurance at ordinary rates as required by the Banks pension scheme.
The Bank arranged the appointments with Dr Bates, told the applicants when and where to go, and provided him with a pro forma report to be filled in.
This was headed Barclays Confidential Medical Report and signed by Dr Bates and the applicant.
Dr Bates was paid a fee for each report.
He was not paid a retainer by the Bank.
If the report was satisfactory, the job offer would be confirmed, subject to examination results.
At that time, the Bank was recruiting young people, many of them female.
Many of the claimants were teenagers at the time, some aged 16, going for their first jobs on leaving school.
The examinations took place in Dr Bates home in Newcastle.
A room in the house had been converted into a consulting room.
The claimants were always alone in the room when they were examined by the doctor, although some attended on their own and some were accompanied by other family members.
It is alleged that Dr Bates sexually assaulted them in the course of those examinations, by inappropriate examination of their breasts and/or digital contact with or penetration of their anus or vagina.
Dr Bates died in 2009 and his estate (worth over half a million pounds) has been distributed.
He cannot be sued by the claimants but neither can the Bank claim contribution from him should any of these actions succeed.
This litigation began in 2015 and a group litigation order was made in 2016.
The managing judge, Nicola Davies J, ordered a trial of the preliminary issue of whether the Bank is vicariously liable for any assaults that Dr Bates is proved to have perpetrated in the course of medical examinations carried out at the Banks request.
On 26 July 2017, Nicola Davies J held that Barclays is vicariously liable for any assaults proved: [2017] EWHC 1929 (QB); [2017] IRLR 1103.
On 17 July 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed Barclays appeal: [2018] EWCA Civ 1670; [2018] IRLR 947.
The Bank now appeals to this court.
The parties cases
The parties respective positions can be simply put.
As Lord Bridge of Harwich stated in D & F Estates Ltd v Church Comrs [1989] AC 177, 208 (echoing the words of Widgery LJ in Salsbury v Woodland [1970] 1 QB 324, 336), It is trite law that the employer of an independent contractor is, in general, not liable for the negligence or other torts committed by the contractor in the course of the execution of the work.
The Bank argues that, although recent decisions have expanded the categories of relationship which can give rise to vicarious liability beyond a contract of employment, they have not so expanded it as to destroy this trite proposition of law, which has been with us since at least the decision of Baron Parke in Quarman v Burnett (1840) 6 M & W 499, 151 ER 509.
The claimants, on the other hand, argue that the recent Supreme Court cases of Christian Brothers, Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10; [2016] AC 660, and Armes v Nottinghamshire County Council [2017] UKSC 60; [2018] AC 355, have replaced that trite proposition with a more nuanced multi factorial approach in which a range of incidents are considered in deciding whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability upon this person for the torts of another person who is not his employee.
That was the approach adopted both by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal in this case.
It will be apparent, therefore, that it is necessary to examine those three decisions in some detail, along with their precursor, the decision of the Court of Appeal in E v English Province of Our Lady of Charity [2012] EWCA Civ 938; [2013] QB 722, some four months before the decision in the Christian Brothers case, as well as some later cases.
As it happens, I sat on all three of the Supreme Court cases and agreed with the leading judgment in each; Lord Reed sat on Cox and Armes, in each of which he delivered the leading judgment; Lord Kerr sat on Christian Brothers and Armes and agreed with the leading judgment in each.
The recent decisions
The recent expansion in the law of vicarious liability began with the House of Lords decision in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22; [2002] 1 AC 215.
The owners of a childrens home were held vicariously liable for the sexual abuse perpetrated by their employee, the warden.
It was thus concerned with stage two of the enquiry the connection between the employment and the wrongdoing and not with stage one.
Nevertheless, it proved influential in later cases, partly because of the willingness to expand the law, and partly because of the prominence it gave to some important decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, which had placed emphasis on the policy considerations underlying the law.
Although their lordships did not endorse all of those policy considerations, they did adopt the same test as had been adopted in Canada.
Furthermore, some of those policy considerations found their way into the later cases dealing with stage one of the enquiry.
In Bazley v Curry [1999] 2 SCR 534, the owners of a childrens home were held vicariously liable for sexual abuse committed by one of their employees in the home.
The fundamental question was whether the wrongful act was sufficiently related to the conduct authorised by the employer to justify imposing vicarious liability.
This was generally appropriate where there was a significant connection between the creation or enhancement of the risk and the wrongdoing.
Vicarious liability would then serve the policy aims of providing an adequate remedy and deterring the risk.
Once engaged in a business it was fair that the employer be made to pay for the generally foreseeable risks of that business.
In contrast, in Jacobi v Griffiths [1999] 2 SCR 570, a childrens club was not vicariously liable for the acts of an employee which took place in the employees home outside working hours.
It was not enough that his employment in the club gave him the opportunity to make friends with the children.
The first English case to consider directly whether the enquiry at stage one might expand beyond the relationship of employee and employer was Es case.
This built upon the earlier decision in Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1151; [2006] QB 510.
Severe flood damage had been caused to a factory, where air conditioning was being installed, by the negligence of a fitters mate; the fitter and his mate had been supplied on a labour only basis by the third defendant to the second defendant to whom some of the work had been sub contracted; the Court of Appeal held both the second and third defendants jointly vicariously liable.
May LJ relied on the fact that both were in a position to control the fitters mate.
Rix LJ, on the other hand, said that he would hazard the view that what one is looking for is a situation where the employee in question, at any rate for relevant purposes, is so much a part of the work, business or organisation of both employers that it is just to make both employers answer for his negligence (para 79).
Thus was vicarious liability extended to a person who was not in law the employer of the tortfeasor.
In Es case, the claimant alleged that while living in a childrens home run
by a Roman Catholic order of nuns she had been sexually abused by a priest appointed by the local diocesan bishop.
The issue was whether the trust which stood in the place of the bishop could be vicariously liable for the priests wrongdoing.
The priest was not an employee of the bishop or the diocese.
Nevertheless, it was held that his relationship with the bishop was sufficiently akin to employment to make it fair and just to hold the bishop vicariously liable.
Significantly, Ward LJ, who gave the leading judgment, did not question the traditional distinction between an employee and an independent contractor.
Rather, he asked himself what was the essence of each of those roles and then asked whether the relationship between the priest and the bishop was closer to that of an employee or to that of an independent contractor.
He summed up the difference thus (para 70): an employee is one who is paid a wage or salary to work under some, if only slight, control of his employer in his employers business for his employers business.
The independent contractor works in and for his own business at his risk of profit or loss.
By that test, the relationship between priest and bishop was sufficiently akin to employment to make it fair and just to hold the bishop liable.
Next came the Christian Brothers case.
This raised issues at both stage one and stage two of the enquiry but much more prominently at stage one.
The claimants had been inmates at a residential school owned by the Catholic Child Welfare Society (referred to as the Middlesbrough defendants), which also employed the teachers.
Some of the teachers, and the head teacher, were members of the Institute of Christian Brothers.
Serious physical and sexual abuse was alleged against some of the brothers.
The issue was whether the Institute could be vicariously liable, jointly with the Middlesbrough defendants.
In para 35, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers listed a number of policy reasons usually making it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability upon an employer for the torts committed by an employee in the course of his employment: the tort will have been committed as a result of activity the employees activity is likely to be part of the the employer is more likely to have the means to (i) compensate the victim than the employee and can be expected to have insured against that liability; (ii) being taken by the employee on behalf of the employer; (iii) business activity of the employer; (iv) the employer, by employing the employee to carry on the activity will have created the risk of the tort committed by the employee; (v) been under the control of the employer.
the employee will, to a greater or lesser degree, have
These are policy reasons, closely related to the policy reasons derived from the Canadian cases and Lister v Hesley Hall.
But, as Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough stressed in that case, at para 60, an exposition of the policy reasons for a rule (or even a description) is not the same as defining the criteria for its application.
Legal rules have to have a greater degree of clarity and definition than is provided by simply explaining the reasons for the existence of the rule and the social need for it, instructive though that may be.
This passage was cited by Ward LJ in Es case, para 54, followed by this: My own view is that one cannot understand how the law relating to vicarious liability has developed nor how, if at all, it should develop without being aware of the various strands of policy which have informed that development.
On the other hand, a coherent development of the law should proceed incrementally in a principled way, not as an expedient reaction to the problem confronting the court.
There appears to have been a tendency to elide the policy reasons for the doctrine of the employers liability for the acts of his employee, set out in para 35 of Christian Brothers, with the principles which should guide the development of that liability into relationships which are not employment but which are sufficiently akin to employment to make it fair and just to impose such liability.
This may have arisen because of what Lord Phillips said, at para 47: At para 35 above, I have identified those incidents of the relationship between employer and employee that make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability on a defendant.
Where the defendant and the tortfeasor are not bound by a contract of employment, but their relationship has the same incidents, that relationship can properly give rise to vicarious liability on the ground that it is akin to that between an employer and an employee.
That was the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in Es case [2013] QB 722.
I do not believe that by his reference to those incidents Lord Phillips was saying that they were the only criteria by which to judge the question.
This is for two reasons.
First, in Es case, Ward LJ had adopted the test of akin to employment but he had not asked himself whether those five incidents were present.
He had conducted a searching enquiry into whether the relationship between the priest and the bishop was more akin to employment than to anything else.
Secondly, when it came to applying the akin to employment test in the Christian Brothers case, Lord Phillips did not address himself to those five incidents but to the detailed features of the relationship.
Thus: 56.
In the context of vicarious liability the relationship between the teaching brothers and the institute had many of the elements, and all the essential elements, of the relationship between employer and employees. (i) The institute was subdivided into a hierarchical structure and conducted its activities as if it were a corporate body. (ii) The teaching activity of the brothers was undertaken because the provincial directed the brothers to undertake it.
True it is that the brothers entered into contracts of employment with the Middlesbrough defendants, but they did so because the provincial required them to do so. (iii) The teaching activity undertaken by the brothers was in furtherance of the objective, or mission, of the institute. (iv) The manner in which the brother teachers were obliged to conduct themselves as teachers was dictated by the institutes rules. 57.
The relationship between the teacher brothers and the institute differed from that of the relationship between employer and employee in that: (i) The brothers were bound to the institute not by contract, but by their vows. (ii) Far from the institute paying the brothers, the brothers entered into deeds under which they were obliged to transfer all their earnings to the institute.
The institute catered for their needs from these funds. 58.
Neither of these differences is material.
Indeed they rendered the relationship between the brothers and the institute closer than that of an employer and its employees.
I have quoted these paragraphs at length to show that he was answering the questions by reference to the details of the relationship, and its closeness to employment, rather than by reference to the five policy reasons in para 35.
It is significant that, shortly after the decision in Christian Brothers, this court decided the case of Woodland v Swimming Teachers Association [2013] UKSC 66; [2014] AC 537, in which it was held that a school had a non delegable duty of care towards the pupils for whom it arranged compulsory swimming lessons with an independent contractor.
Lord Sumption said this, at para 3: The boundaries of vicarious liability have been expanded by recent decisions of the courts to embrace tortfeasors who are not employees of the defendant, but stand in a relationship which is sufficiently analogous to employment: Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2013] 2 AC 1.
But it has never extended to the negligence of those who are truly independent contractors, such as Mrs Stopford appears to have been in this case.
Lord Sumption not only saw the Christian Brothers case as adopting the sufficiently analogous to employment test but also as casting no doubt on the conventional distinction between employees, and those analogous to employees, and independent contractors.
The next case was Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10; [2016] AC 660.
The issue was whether the prison service could be vicariously liable for injuries caused to a prison catering manager by the negligence of a prisoner who was working under her direction on prison service pay.
There was no contract of employment between the prison and the prisoners.
Nevertheless, applying the Christian Brothers case, this court held that the prison was vicariously liable.
It is fair to say that Lord Reed did focus on the five policy factors identified by Lord Phillips.
He pointed out that they are not all of equal significance.
Factor (i), deep pockets, is not in itself a principled reason to impose liability, although the absence of any other source of compensation may sometimes be taken into account (para 20).
Factor (v), control, does not have the significance which once it did.
In todays world an employer is likely to be able to tell an employee what to do but not (at least always) how to do it.
But the absence of even this vestigial degree of control would point against liability (para 21).
That left three interrelated factors: (ii) that the tort was committed as a result of activity undertaken by the tortfeasor on behalf of the defendant; (iii) that the activity was part of the business activity of the defendant; and (iii) that by employing the tortfeasor to do it, the defendant created the risk of his committing the tort (para 22).
He summed up the principle thus (para 24): The result of this approach is that a relationship other than one of employment is in principle capable of giving rise to vicarious liability where harm is wrongfully done by an individual who carries on activities as an integral part of the business activities carried on by a defendant and for its benefit (rather than his activities being entirely attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of his own or of a third party), and where the commission of the wrongful act is a risk created by the defendant by assigning those activities to the individual in question. (Emphasis supplied)
Lord Reed went on to refer to Lord Phillips citation of Es case and the sufficiently akin to employment test (para 26) and to his application of that test to the facts of the Christian Brothers activities (para 27).
He emphasised that this new general approach was not special to cases of alleged sexual abuse (para 29).
He repeated the distinction between integrated activities and activities entirely attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of the tortfeasor or some other person (para 29).
And he pointed out that references to business and enterprise did not mean that the employers activities had to be commercial in nature (para 30).
He had no difficulty in concluding that the prison service was vicariously liable for the prisoners tort.
It seems to me obvious that in Cox the result was bound to be the same whether it was expressed in terms of the test stated in para 24 of Lord Reeds judgment or in terms of the sufficiently akin to employment test.
Indeed, the case for vicarious liability for torts committed by prisoners in the course of their work within the prison seems to me a fortiori the case for vicarious liability for the work done by employees for their employers.
There is nothing in Lord Reeds judgment to cast doubt on the classic distinction between work done for an employer as part of the business of that employer and work done by an independent contractor as part of the business of that contractor.
The last, and perhaps the most difficult, case is Armes v Nottinghamshire County Council [2017] UKSC 60; [2018] AC 855.
The issue was whether the County Council could be vicariously liable for physical and sexual abuse allegedly carried out by two of the foster parents with whom the claimant was placed by the County Council while in their care.
Lord Reed repeated his analysis in Cox, prefacing his account with the statement that, while the classic example of a relationship justifying the imposing of vicarious liability was employer and employee, as explained in Cox and Christian Brothers the doctrine can also apply where the relationship has certain characteristics similar to those found in employment (para 54).
In applying the five incidents identified in those cases, he placed more emphasis on the lack of any other source of compensation if there were no vicarious liability and on the extent of the control exercised by the local authority over the foster parents care for the children (para 62).
In applying the three inter related factors, he held that the relevant activity of the local authority was the care of children committed to the local authoritys care (para 59).
The foster parents were an integral part of the local authoritys organisation of its childcare services, carried on for the benefit of the local authority (para 60).
By placing the children in foster care, the local authority had created the risk of the harm being done (para 61).
Significantly, having examined the relationship between the foster parents and the local authority in some detail, he concluded that the foster parents cannot be regarded as carrying on an independent business of their own (para 59).
There is nothing, therefore, in the trilogy of Supreme Court cases discussed above to suggest that the classic distinction between employment and relationships akin or analogous to employment, on the one hand, and the relationship with an independent contractor, on the other hand, has been eroded.
Two cases decided by common law courts since Christian Brothers and Cox have reached the same conclusion.
In Kafagi v JBW Group Ltd [2018] EWCA Civ 1157, Singh LJ stated that the
development from employment to something akin to employment had not undermined the conventional distinction between a contract of employment and a contract for services (para 21).
The defendant company had a contract with a local authority to collect their council tax debts.
It sub contracted the work to a registered bailiff, the alleged tortfeasor, who ran his own business and could pick and choose what work to do (para 50), had his own insurance (para 52) and could work for other clients (para 53).
Their relationship was not akin to employment (para 56).
In Ng Huat Seng v Mohammad [2017] SGCA 58, the owners of a property
had engaged the tortfeasor as an independent contractor to carry out demolition works at their premises.
It was argued that the recent decisions had undermined the distinction between employees and independent contractors.
The Singapore Court of Appeal (their final court) held that the two cases did not present a new analytical framework.
Rather (para 63): while we accept that the Christian Brothers case and Cox recognise that the doctrine of vicarious liability can be applied outside the strict confines of an employment relationship, it becomes evident, when one examines these judgments more closely, that their essential contribution was to fine tune the existing framework underlying the doctrine so as to accommodate the more diverse range of relationships which might be encountered in todays context.
These relationships, when whittled down to their essence, possess the same fundamental qualities as those which inhere in employer employee relationships, and thus make it appropriate for vicarious liability to be imposed.
Further (para 64): Indeed, we do not see how vicarious liability, the normative foundation of which rests on the theory that it is fair, just and reasonable to hold a defendant liable for the acts of the tortfeasor on the ground that the tortfeasor is in fact engaged in the defendants enterprise, could possibly be extended to tortious acts committed by an independent contractor, who, by definition, is engaged in his own enterprise.
There is simply nothing fair, just and reasonable about imposing secondary liability on a defendant in such a situation.
The question therefore is, as it has always been, whether the tortfeasor is carrying on business on his own account or whether he is in a relationship akin to employment with the defendant.
In doubtful cases, the five incidents identified by Lord Phillips may be helpful in identifying a relationship which is sufficiently analogous to employment to make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability.
Although they were enunciated in the context of non commercial enterprises, they may be relevant in deciding whether workers who may be technically self employed or agency workers are effectively part and parcel of the employers business.
But the key, as it was in Christian Brothers, Cox and Armes, will usually lie in understanding the details of the relationship.
Where it is clear that the tortfeasor is carrying on his own independent business it is not necessary to consider the five incidents.
Application in this case
Clearly, although Dr Bates was a part time employee of the health service, he was not at any time an employee of the Bank.
Nor, viewed objectively, was he anything close to an employee.
He did, of course, do work for the Bank.
The Bank made the arrangements for the examinations and sent him the forms to fill in.
It therefore chose the questions to which it wanted answers.
But the same would be true of many other people who did work for the Bank but were clearly independent contractors, ranging from the company hired to clean its windows to the auditors hired to audit its books.
Dr Bates was not paid a retainer which might have obliged him to accept a certain number of referrals from the Bank.
He was paid a fee for each report.
He was free to refuse an offered examination should he wish to do so.
He no doubt carried his own medical liability insurance, although this may not have covered him from liability for deliberate wrongdoing.
He was in business on his own account as a medical practitioner with a portfolio of patients and clients.
One of those clients was the Bank.
Comment
Until these recent developments, it was largely assumed that a person would be an employee for all purposes employment law, tax, social security and vicarious liability.
Recent developments have broken that link, which may be of benefit to people harmed by the torts of those working in the gig economy.
It would be tempting to align the law of vicarious liability with employment law in a different way.
Employment law now recognises two different types of worker: (a) those who work under a contract of employment and (b) those who work under a contract whereby the individual undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services for another party to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual (Employment Rights Act 1996, section 230(3)).
Limb (b) workers enjoy some but by no means all the employment rights enjoyed by limb (a) workers.
It would be tempting to say that limb (b) encapsulates the distinction between people whose relationship is akin to employment and true independent contractors: people such as the solicitor in Bates van Winkelhof v Clyde and Co LLP [2014] UKSC 32; [2014] 1 WLR 2047, or the plumber in Pimlico Plumbers Ltd v Smith [2018] UKSC 29; [2018] ICR 1511.
Asking that question may be helpful in identifying true independent contractors.
But it would be going too far down the road to tidiness for this court to align the common law concept of vicarious liability, developed for one set of reasons, with the statutory concept of worker, developed for a quite different set of reasons.
Conclusion
I would allow this appeal and hold that the Bank is not vicariously liable for
any wrongdoing of Dr Bates in the course of the medical examinations he carried out for the Bank.
","In this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether Barclays Bank is vicariously liable for sexual assaults allegedly committed between 1968 and about 1984 by the late Dr Gordon Bates.
Dr Bates was a self employed medical practitioner with a portfolio practice.
His work included conducting medical assessments and examinations of prospective Barclays employees.
Barclays required job applicants to pass a pre employment medical examination as part of its recruitment and employment procedures.
Barclays arranged the appointments with Dr Bates and provided him with a pro forma report headed Barclays Confidential Medical Report.
Dr Bates was paid a fee for each report; Barclays did not pay him a retainer.
If the report was satisfactory, the applicants job offer would be confirmed, subject to satisfactory GCE examination results.
Dr Bates conducted the (unchaperoned) medical examinations in a consulting room at his home.
It is alleged that Dr Bates sexually assaulted the 126 claimants in this group action during their medical examinations.
After Dr Bates died in 2009, the claimants sought damages from Barclays.
At first instance, the judge held that Barclays is vicariously liable for any assaults that Dr Bates is proved to have perpetrated.
The Court of Appeal agreed and dismissed Barclays appeal.
Barclays now appeals to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows Barclays appeal, and holds that it is not vicariously liable for Dr Bates alleged wrongdoing.
Lady Hale gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.
Before one person can be made vicariously liable for the torts of another, two elements must be shown.
First, there must be a relationship between the two persons which makes it proper for the law to make one pay for the fault of the other.
Second, there must be a sufficient connection between that relationship and the wrongdoing of the person who committed the tort.
This case concerns the first element [1].
Historically, and leaving aside relationships such as agency and partnership, the relationships that could give rise to vicarious liability were limited to that between an employee and an employer [1].
Accordingly, Barclays case is that, since Dr Bates was an independent contractor and not a Barclays employee, it cannot
be held liable for his wrongdoing.
As Lord Bridge of Harwich said in D & F Estates Ltd v Church Comrs [1989] AC 177 at 208, It is trite law that the employer of an independent contractor is, in general, not liable for the negligence or other torts committed by the contractor in the course of the execution of the work [7].
The claimants, on the other hand, argue that the law has been broadened by the Supreme Court decisions in Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56 (generally known as Christian Brothers), Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10 and Armes v Nottinghamshire County Council [2017] UKSC 60.
They say that these decisions have established a more nuanced approach, in which a range of factors are considered to determine whether or not it is fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability in the circumstances of the case [8].
Lady Hale examines these three decisions in detail at [10 23], together with their precursor, the Court of Appeal decision in E v English Province of Our Lady of Charity [2012] EWCA Civ 938.
The cases make it clear that a person can be held vicariously liable for the acts of someone who is not their employee, provided the relationship between them is sufficiently akin or analogous to employment.
However, they do not erode the classic distinction between employment (and relationships that are akin or analogous to employment) on the one hand, and the relationship with an independent contractor on the other hand [24].
Two cases decided by common law courts since Christian Brothers have reached the same conclusion: namely, the Court of Appeals decision in Kafagi v JBW Group Ltd [2018] EWCA Civ 1157 and the Singapore Court of Appeals decision in Ng Huat Seng v Mohammad [2017] SGCA 58 [25 26].
In light of this, the question is, as it has always been, whether the person who committed the tort is carrying on business on his own account, or whether he is in a relationship akin to employment with the defendant.
In doubtful cases, the five factors or incidents identified by Lord Phillips in Christian Brothers (reproduced at [15]) may help to identify a relationship which is sufficiently analogous to employment to make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability.
But the key will usually lie in understanding the details of the relationship.
Where it is clear that the person who committed the tort is carrying on his own independent business, it is not necessary to consider the five incidents [27].
On the facts, Dr Bates was not at any time an employee or anything close to an employee of Barclays.
Rather, he was in business on his own account as a medical practitioner, with a portfolio of patients and clients.
He did work for Barclays, which made the arrangements for the medical examinations and chose the questions to which it wanted answers, but much the same would be true of window cleaners or auditors.
Dr Bates was not paid a retainer, which might have obliged him to accept a certain number of referrals from Barclays.
He was paid a fee for each report and was free to refuse to conduct an offered examination.
He no doubt carried his own medical liability insurance [28].
Lady Hale considers the relationship between the first element of the test for vicarious liability and the definition of worker in section 230(3) of the Employment Rights Act 1996.
She concludes that asking whether or not a person is a worker who is not an employee within the definition in section 230(3)(b) may be helpful in identifying whether or not they are a true independent contractor, as opposed to being in a relationship akin to employment.
However, she declines to align the common law concept of vicarious liability, developed for one set of reasons, with the statutory concept of worker, developed for quite a different set of reasons [29].
Accordingly, the Court allows the appeal and holds that Barclays is not vicariously liable for any assaults that Dr Bates is proved to have perpetrated in the course of the medical examinations he carried out for Barclays [30].
"
uksc-2012-0250,"If a criminal who previously had leave to remain in this country is liable to deportation because of his offences, but cannot actually be deported because to remove him would infringe his rights under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with the result that the deportation order is revoked, what is the status of his previous leave to remain? It is common ground that the making of a deportation order renders his leave to remain invalid.
The question in this appeal is whether, if the deportation order is revoked, his leave revives or whether the Secretary of State is at that stage free to consider afresh what leave to grant to him.
Mr George was born in Grenada in 1984 and came to this country when 11 in 1995.
As at March 2000 he had been granted indefinite leave to remain here.
Since then, however, he has been convicted on seven different occasions of offences, some relatively minor but some not.
The convictions include five counts of supplying cocaine in January 2002, for which he was sentenced to three years detention in a Young Offenders Institution, driving whilst disqualified and without insurance in December 2003, which resulted in a sentence of eight weeks detention, and, on 7 April 2005, two counts of possession of, respectively, heroin and cocaine, with intent to supply, occasioning four years imprisonment.
On the basis of these convictions, the Secretary of State judged that his deportation would be conducive to the public good.
In January 2007 notice was duly served on him that a deportation order was to be made.
There ensued a series of unsuccessful attempts to challenge that decision, in the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal and the High Court, which lasted until April 2008.
When those rights of appeal were exhausted, the Secretary of State was able actually to make the deportation order of which advance notice had been given, and that order was made on 24 April 2008.
Mr George, however, made further application to the Secretary of State contending that to deport him would infringe his article 8 rights to respect for his private and family life.
He has a partner whom he has known since he was at school, and although they do not and have not lived together, they have a daughter born in 2005 who sees her father reasonably often and stays with him on occasion.
The Secretary of State took the view that, balancing this level of family life against Mr Georges convictions, his deportation would not amount to a breach of article 8, and she refused to revoke the deportation order.
However, after a number of intermediate stages of legal process, Mr Georges immigration appeal against that last decision was allowed by the immigration judge in a ruling promulgated on 31 March 2009.
She held that, although the case was a borderline one, the balance between the conviction history and the family life had been struck wrongly by the Secretary of State.
It is common ground that the effect of this decision was to revoke the deportation order on the grounds that to implement it would infringe Mr Georges article 8 rights to family life.
Subsequently, Mr Georges solicitors called on the Secretary of State to confirm that he had indefinite leave to remain, but she refused to do so.
Instead she granted him six months discretionary leave on 2 August 2013.
This court was told that since that expired it has been replaced with a grant of three years discretionary leave.
It appears that the Secretary of State is treating him as she treats a number of other immigrants, and is implementing what may turn out to be a pattern of successive grants of discretionary leave to remain and which may result, if all goes well, in that leave becoming indefinite, but not until something of the order of 10 years have passed.
His case, however, is that his original indefinite leave to remain has revived when the deportation order was revoked.
He advanced this case by way of application for judicial review of the Secretary of States decision not to reinstate indefinite leave to remain but instead to make grants of time limited leave.
He failed before the judge but before the Court of Appeal succeeded by a majority.
This is the appeal of the Secretary of State from the latter decision: [2013] 1 WLR 1319.
The statutory provisions for deportation
The statutory trail begins with the Immigration Act 1971 (the 1971 Act).
Although it has been amended subsequently, the relevant provisions date from its enactment and have stood (save for immaterial adjustments) for 40 years.
By section 3 it requires that those with no specific right of entry to the United Kingdom need leave to enter, which leave may be indefinite or time limited and may be subject to conditions.
Section 3(5) and (6), together with section 5, contain the provisions for deportation.
First, subsections 3(5) and (6) deal with when a person is liable to deportation.
They say: (5) A person who is not a British citizen is liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if (a) the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good; or (b) another person to whose family he belongs is or has been ordered to be deported. (6) Without prejudice to the operation of subsection (5) above, a person who is not a British citizen shall also be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if, after he has attained the age of seventeen, he is convicted of an offence for which he is punishable with imprisonment and on his conviction is recommended for deportation by a court empowered by this Act to do so.
Once a person is liable to deportation under these rules, one turns to section 5, which provides for the actual making of a deportation order: 5(1) Where a person is under section 3(5) or (6) above liable to deportation, then subject to the following provisions of this Act the Secretary of State may make a deportation order against him, that is to say an order requiring him to leave and prohibiting him from entering the United Kingdom; and a deportation order against a person shall invalidate any leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom given him before the order is made or while it is in force. (2) A deportation order against a person may at any time be revoked by a further order of the Secretary of State, and shall cease to have effect if he becomes a British citizen.
The final stage is provided for by section 5(5) and Schedule 3, which permits the Secretary of State to give directions for removal of those against whom a deportation order is in force, which directions may stipulate such matters as the manner of removal and form of travel.
These deportation provisions remain in force and are the ones which applied to Mr George.
It should, however, be noted that since the passing of the UK Borders Act 2007 (the 2007 Act), the commonest source of a decision to deport a convicted person lies in the provisions of section 32 of that Act, styled automatic deportation.
The effect of this section is that (i) a non British citizen who (inter alia) is sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment or more is termed a foreign criminal, (ii) as such his deportation is deemed to be conducive to the public good for the purposes of section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act so that he is liable to deportation, and (iii) the making of a deportation order is mandatory rather than discretionary, and irrevocable, unless specific exceptions apply, of which one is that removal would entail infringement of Convention rights.
It follows that in Mr Georges case: i) once the Secretary of State had decided under section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act that his deportation would be conducive to the public good, he became liable to deportation; the notice served on him in January 2007 warned him of an impending deportation order in consequence; (ii) at that stage his indefinite leave to remain continued extant but precarious, as it did throughout the 18 months or so following, during which unsuccessful attempts were made to challenge the decision that he was liable to deportation; this is consistent with the general scheme of the immigration appeals system, under which whilst appeals are pending suitable (if varying) provision is made to preserve the position in the interim; (iii) when in April 2008 the deportation order was made under section 5(1) of the 1971 Act the consequence was that his indefinite leave to remain was invalidated under the closing words of that subsection; (iv) the immigration judges ruling in March 2009 that his article 8 rights would be infringed by deportation was made on his appeal against the refusal by the Secretary of State to revoke the deportation order; the consequence is agreed to be that the deportation order was thereby revoked; (v) he remains liable to be deported, but an order for his deportation cannot be made in his present circumstances because it would entail an infringement of his Convention rights.
The case for revival of indefinite leave to remain
For Mr George, the carefully crafted submissions of Mr Knafler QC that his indefinite leave to remain revived when the deportation order was revoked can conveniently be considered under 2 headings: (a) it is said that as a matter of construction, section 5(1) and (2) of the 1971 Act mean that upon revocation the position reverts to the status quo ante, viz the indefinite leave revives; it is said that the position is made clear by considering other statutes (b) in pari materia, in particular section 76 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act), section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act), and the automatic deportation provisions of the 2007 Act (paragraph 7 above).
Section 5(1) & (2) of the 1971 Act
Mr Knaflers submission is that section 5(1) prescribes three consequences of a deportation order a direction to leave, a prohibition on return and the invalidation of any existing leave to remain.
Accordingly, he says, revocation under section 5(2) reverses all three consequences.
This, however, does little more than assume what it seeks to prove.
His three consequences of a deportation order are in any event of differing character; the first two require obedience by action or omission on the part of the individual, whereas the third is a statement of a legal effect.
The wording of these two sections does not by itself provide a conclusive answer to the question of whether revocation of a deportation order operates to revive leave to remain which the making of the order invalidated.
If anything, the wording tends to suggest that revocation operates as from the moment it occurs, that is to say is prospective rather than retrospective.
It is from that moment onwards that the individual is no longer under an obligation to leave, and is free to return.
Consistently with that, one might expect that the invalidation of leave which has occurred through the making of the deportation order is not undone.
Mr Knaflers associated submission is that the words shall cease to have effect in section 5(2) govern both revocation and the different trigger of the individual becoming a British citizen.
Even if they did, that does not help answer the question what is meant by cease to have effect, which could bear either a prospective or retrospective meaning, albeit it more strongly suggests the former.
But in any event, it is quite clear that these words are associated only with the citizenship trigger and not with revocation.
It makes perfectly good sense for the subsection to distinguish between them since the first depends on the act of the Secretary of State (or the Immigration Judge on appeal) whereas the latter is independent of any act of hers.
The wording of section 5(2) may by itself be capable of bearing the meaning that revocation reverses the legal effect of the deportation order and thus revives leave to remain, but if that had been the intent, one might have anticipated the statute saying so.
What is, however, completely clear is that it has been treated from the outset by relevant persons operating or commenting upon the Act as meaning that revocation did not undo the invalidation of leave to remain which had been achieved by section 5(1).
The body of evidence of this is considerable.
It includes the following. (i) Draft Immigration Rules were prepared contemporaneously with the passage through Parliament of the 1971 Act (Immigration Rules: Control after Entry (Cmnd 4610) as amended by Cmnd 4792); these were considered by both Houses prior to the completion of the Acts legislative progress; the draft rules included paragraph 58 which stated in terms: Revocation of the deportation order does not entitle the person concerned to re enter the United Kingdom; it renders him eligible to qualify for admission under the immigration rules. (ii) That provision was then repeated at paragraph 66 of the substantive Statement of Immigration Rules for Control after Entry (HC 510), which was laid before Parliament on 23 October 1972. (iii) Every subsequent Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules has contained the same proposition in identical terms, including the current one (1994) (HC 395) at paragraph 392; all have been laid before Parliament pursuant to section 3(2) of the 1971 Act, under the negative resolution procedure. (iv) Successive editions of Macdonalds Immigration Law and Practice in the United Kingdom from the first (1983) until the current 8th (2010) record this same proposition without question.
If the wording were incapable of contrary reading, an error in its interpretation in the Rules, however long perpetuated, would not reverse its correct construction.
But this wording is not clear.
Moreover, the successive assumptions in the Rules about its meaning are very relevant when one comes to consider Mr Knaflers second submission, and in particular the terms of section 76 of the 2002 Act, which is the section which persuaded the majority of the Court of Appeal that he was right.
Section 76 of the 2002 Act
Prior to this provision indefinite leave to remain could not be removed except by a deportation order and the operation of section 5(1) of the 1971 Act.
Section 76 gave the Secretary of State a new power to revoke a persons indefinite leave to remain, in three defined situations: (1) where a person is liable to deportation but cannot be deported for legal reasons, (2) where leave was obtained by deception such as would make the person liable to removal, but he cannot be removed for legal or practical reasons and (3) where he had, in specified circumstances, ceased to be the refugee which he previously had been.
Section 76(1) deals with the first situation: The Secretary of State may revoke a person's indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom if the person (a) is liable to deportation, but (b) cannot be deported for legal reasons.
The argument which was accepted by the majority of the Court of Appeal was that this enactment, which is part of the same statutory body of immigration law as the 1971 Act, must have been passed on the assumption that it contained the only power by which such a persons leave to remain could be removed.
Mr George and others like him are people who are liable to deportation but cannot be deported for legal reasons.
That in turn meant, it was held, that the revocation of a deportation order in the case of such a person must have had the effect of reviving any leave to remain which he had.
Otherwise, so the argument ran, there would be no need for section 76(1).
It is certainly true that the two statutes are part of the same body of immigration law and should be construed consistently with one another so far as possible, although the speed and intensity of legislative change in this field undoubtedly leaves open the real possibility that not every provision is consistent with every other.
It is also clear, and conceded by the Secretary of State, that section 76(1) would apply to Mr George.
It does not, however, follow that there was no point in enacting section 76(1) unless revocation of a deportation order revived leave to remain.
In the case of Mr George the legal bar to his deportation was only upheld after the deportation order had been made.
But there will be many others who cannot be deported for similar legal reasons but in whose case this is apparent from the moment when they became liable to deportation.
There may be many convicted persons who would be deported but for obvious Convention rights bars, perhaps because the conditions in the home country would infringe article 3, or because the convict has very long standing and strong article 8 rights.
The legal bar to deportation may be recognised without dispute by the Secretary of State.
In such a case, section 76(1) adds the power, which otherwise did not exist, to revoke indefinite leave to remain.
The case for the existence of such a power is clear.
A human rights claim may well prevent actual deportation, but the individual concerned is, by definition, a person whose presence is no longer conducive to the public good.
If a deportation order cannot be made, it may make good sense to alter his status from indefinite leave to remain to limited or, more likely, conditional leave, which may give scope for control of his activities in the public interest.
Although the 2007 Act was not in existence when section 76 was enacted, its scheme for automatic deportation provides another example of a case when section 76 would be available without there being any deportation order to be revoked.
If the Secretary of State determines that section 32(5) of the 2007 Act applies to render an individual liable to deportation, it is not the making of a deportation order but the antecedent decision that the provisions of the Act apply which is appealable: see section 82(3A) of the 2002 Act, inserted by section 35(3) of the 2007 Act.
So, if challenge were made to that decision, and were upheld on human rights grounds, there would be no deportation order to be revoked, but the individuals indefinite leave to remain could be removed and replaced with a different kind of leave by acting under section 76.
A second powerful reason for rejecting the argument based upon section 76, perhaps not fully ventilated before the Court of Appeal, lies in the history set out at paragraph 12 above.
The whole basis of the decision of the Court of Appeal was that section 76 demonstrates that Parliament assumed that the effect of section 5 of the 1971 Act was to revive leave to remain if a deportation order was revoked.
But the history demonstrates that Parliament cannot have done so; on the contrary, the assumption at the time was the opposite.
A third reason was identified by Stanley Burnton LJ, dissenting in the Court of Appeal.
Quite apart from the case of the individual who remains in the United Kingdom and cannot be deported for legal reasons, he considered that there may be other situations in which revocation of a deportation order is appropriate.
One suggested case is where a person has been successfully deported and applies subsequently for limited leave to make a brief visit, perhaps to relatives, and perhaps in circumstances where it is appropriate to grant the application on compassionate grounds.
Such a person could not simply return, because the deportation order under which he was removed would prevent it.
The Secretary of State would need to revoke the deportation order and make a fresh grant of limited or conditional leave.
She could not use section 76 to do this, because such a person would not be someone who could not be deported for legal reasons.
Stanley Burnton LJ reasoned that Parliament could not have intended that in such a situation the revocation of the deportation order would have the effect of reviving an indefinite leave to remain.
This scenario gave rise to a complex debate as to whether there exist other powers by which the Secretary of State might achieve the same end, in particular by invoking article 13(7) of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 (SI 2000/1161) (the 2000 Order).
This Order first preserved leave which would otherwise have been treated under section 3(4) of the 1971 Act as lapsed by reason of travel outside the common travel area, and then created by article 13(7) a discretionary power to cancel it when it was only in force because thus preserved.
It is possible that this power might now be used in the scenario contemplated by Stanley Burnton LJ, although only if paragraph 321A of the Immigration Rules were first amended, for that rule presently restricts the use of article 13(7) to specific situations which do not include this scenario.
But what matters is what section 5(2) of the 1971 Act meant when it was enacted.
At that time the 2000 Order had not seen the light of day and there could be no question of applying article 13(7).
The law was, under section 3(4) of the same 1971 Act, that: A person's leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom shall lapse on his going to a country or territory outside the common travel area (whether or not he lands there), unless within the period for which he had leave he returns to the United Kingdom in circumstances in which he is not required to obtain leave to enter; but, if he does so return, his previous leave (and any limitation on it or conditions attached to it) shall continue to apply.
This provision cannot be read, in the context of the 1971 Act where it appears, as applying to a person deported under section 5.
If it did, there would be no need for section 5(1) to make any provision at all for the deportation order to invalidate the leave to remain.
Nor, even if the effect of section 5(2) is to revive a former leave to remain if a deportation order is revoked, could this section bite at removal under the order since the formerly existing leave would at that stage be invalidated by section 5(1) and there would be nothing to lapse.
It may be uncertain how much Stanley Burnton LJs scenario was in anyones mind at the time of the passing of the 1971 Act, so its impact on the construction question which arises in this case is perhaps limited.
But the possibility that the Secretary of State might wish to revoke a deportation order of someone, either present in the United Kingdom or not, and to replace it with limited or conditional leave, must have existed then as well as now, irrespective of any question of Convention rights obstructing removal.
This part of the reasoning of Stanley Burnton LJ therefore does provide some limited additional support for the argument that section 5(2) should not be read as meaning that on revocation of a deportation order any formerly held leave to remain revives.
In the Court of Appeal, Sir Stephen Sedley observed at para 32 that if section 76 was the only route available to the Secretary of State to remove leave to remain in the circumstances of a case such as the present, that would mean that the individual would have a right of appeal (under section 82 of the 2002 Act).
Whilst that is correct, it cannot assist on the meaning of section 5(2) as at 1971 since section 76 did not then exist.
Nor does the prospect of such a right of appeal fortify the case for such as Mr George.
Anyone faced with a deportation order already has ample right of appeal and against an order which will invalidate his leave to remain as the history of this case illustrates.
There is no occasion for a legitimate claim to a further appeal.
Sir Stephen also observed at para 32 that if the Secretary of State was right, a person such as Mr George would be left in limbo, being irremovable yet having no leave to remain.
That also does not assist.
The Secretary of State accepts that some leave must be granted if removal is impossible, and has in fact made such grants to Mr George.
In any event, there would equally be a limbo if the powers under section 76 were exercised.
For these reasons, the argument from section 76 does not avail Mr George.
Section 10 of the 1999 Act
Section 10 gives the Secretary of State power to direct summary removal of specific categories of people where, essentially, their leave to remain is seriously flawed.
The two principal categories are those who have failed to observe a condition of their leave (who accordingly are outside the leave granted) and those who obtained it by deception.
The other two categories are those whose position is as a dependent family member of someone being removed under this same section and those who have ceased to be refugees within the meaning of section 76(3) of the 2002 Act (supra at paragraph 13).
The effect of removal directions is, by section 10(8) (as substituted by section 48 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006), to invalidate the leave to remain.
Thus the language employed mirrors that of section 5(1) of the 1971 Act.
Mr Knafler contends that in this section a withdrawal or revocation of the removal directions would clearly revive the leave to remain and that accordingly the same must apply to revocation of a deportation order under section 5 of the 1971 Act.
The precise meaning of section 10(8) is not before this court and it would be wrong to attempt to decide it in the absence of facts raising the issue.
Much might depend on the circumstances of any withdrawal and what if any alternative step the Secretary of State attempted or purported to take.
But it should not be assumed either that the effect of the section is that withdrawal of the removal directions would reinstate the leave to remain, unaltered, or that, if it would, the same was the rule created 28 years earlier by section 5 of the 1971 Act for the different situation of a deportation order made because the presence of the individual is not conducive to the public good.
The appeal rights of those affected by section 10 summary removal directions and those facing deportation are quite different.
In any event, it is unsafe to reason from a different regime enacted 28 years afterwards to the meaning of the 1971 Act.
Automatic deportation under the 2007 Act
Mr Knafler suggests that unless section 5(2) of the 1971 Act involves revival if the deportation order is revoked, a person who successfully appeals automatic deportation will still have his leave to remain invalidated; hence, he submits, section 5(2) must involve revival.
The argument runs as follows. (A) In a non automatic case an appeal against a decision (under section 3(5) of the 1971 Act) that a persons deportation is conducive to the public good, and thus that a deportation order will follow, is appealable under section 82(2)(j) of the 2002 Act and whilst the appeal is pending no deportation order can be made: see section 79(1) of that Act; (B) when the 2007 Act scheme was introduced the decision which was made appealable is not the making of the deportation order but the antecedent decision that the individual is caught by the automatic deportation rules: section 82(3A) of the 2002 Act, as introduced by section 35 of the 2007 Act; (C) at the same time section 79 of the 2002 Act was modified by the introduction of subsections (3) and (4) which provide that the usual prohibition on making a deportation order whilst an appeal is pending does not apply but that during that time there is an exception to the rule under section 5(1) of the 1971 Act that it invalidates the leave to remain; (D) therefore it is possible that the individual could succeed in his appeal, establish that he is not caught by the automatic deportation rules, but yet there may be a deportation order which will have the effect, once the appeal is over and no longer pending, of invalidating his leave to remain.
This may or may not be a possible scenario.
The import of the 2007 Act needs to be resolved on facts arising from it and not hypothetically on a case to which it has no application.
That the legislation is not as a whole entirely cohesive is demonstrated by the fact that in a non automatic case, the appeal may be against either the decision to make a deportation order or against a refusal to revoke the order itself if matters have advanced that far; the appealable decisions are described in section 82(2)(j) and (k).
If the postulated automatic deportation case is a possible scenario, it would not of course apply except where (a) a deportation order was made, as it need not be, and (b) the effect of a successful appeal is to induce its revocation.
There are, in any event, very limited grounds on which an appeal against automatic deportation of a foreign criminal can be mounted.
The principal ones in practice may well be that Convention rights prevent deportation (exception 1 pursuant to section 33(2) of the 2007 Act).
It is not necessarily anomalous or wrong that a foreign criminal who would be deported but for a Convention bar should have his indefinite leave to remain invalidated and that the Secretary of State should be able to regulate his status in this country by means of limited or conditional leave (see below).
It is not possible to reason from a single suggested scenario under an Act of 2007 to the true meaning of a statute passed 36 years earlier.
Conclusion
The terms of section 5 of the 1971 Act are, as words, capable either of importing revival of leave or of not doing so.
Revival is not their natural meaning, because the natural meaning is that revocation takes effect when it happens and does not undo events occurring during the lifetime of the deportation order.
Revival is a significant and far reaching legal concept, and it is much more likely that it would have been specifically provided for if it had been intended.
The reasoning of the Court of Appeal, from section 76 of the 2002 Act, cannot be supported.
Whilst statutes in pari materia should be construed consistently if possible, a later statute is not a reliable guide to the meaning of an earlier one, especially in a field such as immigration where social and political pressures have led to fast moving changes in the legislation.
In particular, the history of the treatment of section 5(2) of the 1971 Act in successive rules laid before Parliament both before and ever since the 1971 Act was passed shows very plainly that there cannot have been a legislative assumption that revival was its effect.
The contrary construction, involving no question of revival, is entirely consistent with the scheme of the 1971 Act (and indeed subsequent statutes) on the topic of deportation.
The position of Mr George is not analogous to someone with a pending appeal.
His status as a person liable to deportation has long since been established; his appeal challenging it failed long ago.
Persons are liable to be deported, under any of the procedures which may apply, because their presence in the United Kingdom is judged not to be conducive to the public good.
That is true of Mr George.
If it turns out that there is a legal obstacle to actual removal, for example because of Convention rights which cannot be infringed, that does not alter the fact he is a person whose presence is not conducive to the public good.
There is no legal symmetry in indefinite leave to remain co existing with the status of someone whose presence is not conducive to the public good.
It makes perfectly good sense, whilst the legal obstacle remains, for the Secretary of State to be in a position to re visit the terms of leave to enter.
Moreover, the legal obstacle is not necessarily, or even usually, permanent.
If it arises from conditions in the individuals home country, those conditions may change or he may come into favour with the authorities when previously he was not.
If it arises from his family connections in the United Kingdom, those may easily change.
If someone in his position cannot at present be deported because to do so would infringe his article 8 rights, and if indefinite leave to remain were thereupon to revive, he would remain irremovable if he turned his back on his family, or they on him, as may not infrequently occur.
Whilst there may be different routes by which the Secretary of State could now achieve a similar result, for example via section 76 of the 2002 Act, it is clear that this was also the coherent result of the 1971 Act, from the time that it was enacted.
On its correct construction, section 5(2) of the 1971 Act does not mean that if the deportation order is revoked, the invalidation by section 5(1) of leave to remain is retrospectively undone and the previous leave to remain does not revive.
Mr George remains liable to deportation, even though it cannot at present be carried out.
His position in the United Kingdom must be regularised, but that does not entail a recognition of indefinite leave to remain.
The Secretary of States grant to him of successive limited leaves is perfectly proper.
Whether or not it may become appropriate after the passage of time to re grant indefinite leave is a matter for her.
For those reasons, the appeal of the Secretary of State should be allowed and the order of the judge dismissing the claim for judicial review should be reinstated.
","Mr George was born in Grenada in 1984 and came to the UK in 1995 at the age of 11.
In March 2000 he was granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK.
He has a partner whom he has known since school, with whom he has a daughter born in 2005.
He and his partner do not live together: his daughter however sees him reasonably often and sometimes stays with him.
Since 2000, Mr George has been convicted of seven different offences, including supply of cocaine and possession with intent to supply heroin and cocaine.
The Secretary of State decided that Mr Georges deportation would be conducive to the public good.
From that point he was, by section 3(5) Immigration Act 1971 (the 1971 Act), liable to deportation.
Notice was served upon him, in January 2007, that a deportation order was to be made against him.
He unsuccessfully challenged that decision and, on 24 April 2008, a deportation order was made in respect of him.
The effect of that deportation order, by section 5(1) of the 1971 Act, was to invalidate his ILR.
Mr George made a further application to the Secretary of State arguing that his deportation to Grenada would be unlawful under section 6 Human Rights Act 1998 as it would breach his right to private and family life under Article 8 ECHR.
The Secretary of State rejected that application, but an immigration judge allowed his appeal on 31 March 2009.
The effect of that judgment was to revoke his deportation order.
The question in this case is Mr Georges immigration status following the making and revocation of the deportation order.
Did Mr Georges ILR, invalidated by the deportation order, revive when the deportation order was itself revoked? Mr Georges solicitors considered that it did, and called on the Secretary of State to confirm this.
The Secretary of State however considered that it did not, and instead granted six months discretionary leave to remain (DLR) on 2 August 2013.
On the expiry of that leave the Secretary of State granted a further three years DLR.
Mr George judicially reviewed the decision not to reinstate ILR.
He argued that on the true interpretation of section 5(1) (2) Immigration Act 1971, his ILR was reinstated by the revocation of the deportation order.
Subsection (1) provides that a deportation order shall invalidate any leave to remain given [to a person] before the order is made or while it is in force.
Subsection (2) provides that a deportation order may at any time be revoked by a further order of the Secretary of State, and shall cease to have effect if he becomes a British citizen.
He further argued that an interpretation of section 5 by which his ILR was revived was supported by the fact that other immigration statutes, particularly section 76 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act), required that reading of the 1971 Act.
Mr Georges claim was dismissed in the High Court, but his appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed.
The Secretary of State appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
Lord Hughes gives the only reasoned judgment, with which the other members of the court agree.
The better reading of section 5 of the 1971 Act is that it does
not revive prior leave on a deportation orders revocation.
The other statutory provisions relied upon by Mr George do not support his case.
Mr Georges first argument is that on its natural meaning, (i) revocation of a deportation order under section 5(2) of the 1971 Act must reverse all the consequences of the order listed in section 5(1), including therefore the invalidation of the leave to remain, and (ii) that the words shall cease to have effect in section 5(2) govern both the citizenship and revocation possibilities in that subsection.
However, neither point is compelling.
The wording of the subsections does not provide a conclusive answer to the question in the appeal [10 11].
Importantly, the 1971 Act has consistently been treated as meaning that revocation does not revive prior leave to remain.
Draft Immigration Rules which made this clear were prepared (and considered by Parliament) alongside the 1971 Act, and every subsequent version of the Immigration Rules has contained the same statement.
Each version has been laid before Parliament.
Likewise, successive editions of practitioner textbooks have taken the same position [12].
Revival of prior leave to remain is not the natural meaning of section 5 of the 1971 Act.
It is a significant and far reaching legal concept, and it is likely that if intended, it would have been explicitly provided [29].
The treatment of section 5(2) of the 1971 Act in successive Rules laid before Parliament clearly demonstrates that there was no legislative assumption that the effect of revocation of a deportation order was revival of prior leave to remain [30].
Mr Georges second argument was that other immigration statutes, particularly section 76 of the 2002 Act, indicate that the proper interpretation of the 1971 Act is that revocation of a deportation order revives leave to remain. section 76 provides a power for the Secretary of State to revoke ILR if a person is liable to deportation but cannot be deported for legal reasons.
Mr George argued that this power would be superfluous if the making of a deportation order irrevocably cancelled ILR [13 14].
However, this is incorrect.
While the legal impediment to Mr Georges deportation arose only after his deportation order was made, in other cases the legal impediment would be apparent prior to this point, and so the order would never be made. section 76 provides a power for the Secretary of State to revoke ILR and instead provide for limited or conditional leave.
In any event the only import of this argument goes to Parliaments intention when it passed the 1971 Act: the legislative history set out at [12] demonstrates that Parliament intended a deportation order irrevocably to extinguish prior leave to remain [16 18].
A number of arguments based on other statutes and situations were raised.
Where an individual previously possessing ILR had been deported, that individual might need to return to the UK for a brief period.
The Secretary of State would need to revoke the deportation order and make a fresh grant of conditional leave.
It could not be right that in such a situation the previous ILR would revive, and this provided some limited support for the Secretary of States position.
The Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 did not alter this conclusion, since the issue is the construction of the 1971 Act, and the problem existed prior to 2000 [19 21].
Mr George had based an argument on an analogy with section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
However, that issue was not squarely before the court, and it would be wrong to determine its interpretation in the abstract [25 26].
The same was true of the UK Borders Act 2007 [27 28].
More fundamentally, it is wrong to reason from suggested scenarios under later Acts to the meaning of an earlier Act.
Later statutes are not reliable guides to the meaning of earlier ones, particular in areas where there have been fast moving changes to the legislation [30].
"
uksc-2016-0048,"On 21 March 2016, this court gave a father permission to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal that a custody order which he had obtained in Romania should not be enforced in this country under the Brussels II (Revised) Regulation (BIIR), because it had been given without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure in this country.
In the view of the panel giving permission to appeal, the judgment of the Court of Appeal raised an arguable point of law of general public importance, as to the precise extent to which it is a fundamental principle of the procedure relating to all cases about children in the courts of England and Wales that the child should be given an opportunity to be heard.
This is a question of importance in all childrens cases, not just those where the court here is asked to enforce a judgment given in another member state of the European Union.
However, it has now become clear that under BIIR this court has no jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal.
This point was not raised by the respondent mother in her notice of objection to the application for permission to appeal.
No doubt, had she done so, the court would have listed it for oral argument before deciding whether or not to give permission.
In the event, once it was raised, we were able to arrange a hearing at short notice, in advance of the date set for the substantive appeal.
As a point of jurisdiction, it could not be ignored, however inconveniently late in the day it was raised.
We are grateful to the parties for the speed with which they have prepared their written and oral arguments and, in particular, to the Ministry of Justice, whom we asked to intervene in order to give us an account of the relevant history.
The history of the case
The circumstances in which this question arises are deeply unfortunate, not least because of the delays there have been, not only in Romania but also in this country, but they are largely irrelevant to the question of law which we have to decide.
The child in question, DD, was born in Romania on 8 November 2006 and so is now aged nine and a half.
His parents are both Romanian but met while working in this country.
They returned briefly to Romania, where they got married and the child was born, but by January 2007 both parents had returned to live in this country with the child.
They separated in November 2007.
DD has continued to live here with his mother, his main carer, ever since.
The father returned to live in Romania in 2009, but has kept a second home here and for most of the intervening years (with a long gap from November 2012 until March 2014) has shared the care of DD with the mother.
He has a significant relationship with his son.
Although DD is undoubtedly habitually resident in this country, the parties chose to litigate about his future in Romania.
The father issued divorce and custody proceedings there in November 2007.
The couple were divorced in April 2008.
The father was awarded custody of DD, but the mother successfully appealed.
At the retrial, the father was again awarded custody, but first the mother and then the father successfully appealed.
At a further retrial in a different court, in December 2011, the court awarded joint parental authority to both parents, while finding that DDs domicile and residence were at the mothers address in England.
Both parties appealed, but their appeals were dismissed in March 2013, on the basis that joint custody is the norm and sole custody the exception.
Nevertheless, the child should remain living with his mother in England, as it was not in his best interests to change his living arrangements.
The father launched a further appeal, to the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
Its final decision, in November 2013, was that the child should live with the father, on the basis that he could provide the best moral and material conditions.
In February 2014, the father applied for the recognition and enforcement of this order by the English court.
The result was the re establishment of contact between father and son and a High Court ordered arrangement that the parents share his care in this country while the fathers application proceeded.
On 1 May 2014, Peter Jackson J ordered that DD be made a party to the enforcement proceedings: see the summary of the history in In re D (Recognition and Enforcement of Romanian Order) [2014] EWHC 2756 (Fam), [2015] 1 FLR 1272.
He quotes, in para 33, the reasons given in his earlier judgment.
This was not so as to make inquiries as to his welfare, which would be inappropriate in enforcement proceedings, but because Ds rights as an individual child are engaged in his fathers application and whatever has happened in this case he bears no responsibility for it (para 15).
His interest was not being represented (para 16) and the facts were egregious (para 10) neither the judge, nor counsel, nor the Childrens Guardian had experienced a case in which enforcement is being sought with regard to a child who has attained the age of seven and has never lived in the country from which the relevant order emanates (para 11).
The registration of an order under BIIR is essentially administrative, although it requires a judicial act: see In re S (Foreign Contact Order) [2009] EWCA Civ 993, [2010] 1 FLR 982, para 12.
Judicial consideration of any dispute occurs at the first appeal stage.
This came before Peter Jackson J who determined it in July 2014 (reference above).
Article 23 lays down seven grounds for non recognition.
The judge rejected the mothers case on article 23(a), that recognition was manifestly contrary to the public policy of the member state in which recognition is sought taking into account the best interests of the child.
This ground is to be narrowly construed and the Bucharest decision was not so extreme as to require recognition to be withheld on this ground (para 74).
However, he did refuse recognition under article 23(b), which provides that a judgment shall not be recognised if it was given, except in case of urgency, without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of the member state in which recognition is sought.
The Bucharest Court of Appeals conclusion about DDs wishes and feelings, namely that he constantly craves for [the fathers] permanent presence, had not arisen from any direct or indirect enquiry involving the child himself (para 83).
It had a report from a Cafcass officer in earlier enforcement proceedings when DD was two years old.
It had a report from a social worker when he was five and a half, in response to the fathers concerns about the mothers care.
At the first tier appeal in February 2013, the father had asked the court to hear the child, but the mother had opposed this (interestingly, given her current stance), and the court had deemed it not useful given the age of the minor.
Peter Jackson J disagreed: The childs entitlement to a voice is a fundamental procedural principle in our system.
If he is old enough, it will be his voice and his words.
An adult voice will convey the younger childs point of view.
Younger children are less able to articulate their wishes, but their feelings may be more vivid than those of older children and of adults, whose views we canvass without a second thought. (para 96)
A report from a court social worker, containing the childs perspective, would be fundamental to the decision of any English court, faced with a striking application of this kind (peremptory change of lifelong carer, country and language) (para 103).
He therefore allowed the mothers appeal on this ground.
He also allowed her appeal on the grounds contained in article 23(c) (lack of service) and (d) (not giving the mother an opportunity of being heard).
The Court of Appeal dismissed the mothers cross appeal on article 23(a), allowed the fathers appeal on article 23(c) and (d), but dismissed the fathers appeal on article 23(b): [2016] EWCA Civ 12, [2016] 1 WLR 2469.
The question of whether and how the childs voice was to be heard in the proceedings was a separate question from the weight to be given to his wishes and feelings: the rule of law in England and Wales includes the right of the child to participate in the process that is about him or her.
That is the fundamental principle that is reflected in our legislation, our rules and practice directions and jurisprudence.
At its most basic level it involves asking at an early stage in family proceedings whether and how that child is going to be given the opportunity to be heard.
The qualification in section 1(3)(a) [of the Children Act 1989] like that in article 12(1) [of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989] relates to the weight to be put upon a childs wishes and feelings, not their participation. (para 44)
This court is not concerned with whether the decisions reached by the trial judge and Court of Appeal in this particular case were right or wrong.
They may very well have been right.
Nor is it concerned with the extent to which the childs right to be heard is a fundamental principle of the procedure in the courts of England and Wales in cases relating to the future of children.
That is a very large question and views may differ as to precisely what the effect is of the Court of Appeals judgment.
This court is solely concerned with whether we have any jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal that the Romanian order should not be registered and enforced in this country.
The jurisdiction question
The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is governed by section 40 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.
So far as material, this provides: (2) An appeal lies to the Court from any order or judgment of the Court of Appeal in England and Wales in civil proceedings. (6) An appeal under subsection (2) lies only with the permission of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court; but this is subject to provision under any other enactment restricting such an appeal.
The question, therefore, is whether the provisions of BIIR constitute an enactment restricting such an appeal from the Court of Appeal or otherwise override the provisions of the 2005 Act.
This encompasses two questions: first, what is the meaning and effect of the provisions of BIIR in European Union law; and second, what is their effect upon the provisions of an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament?
The Brussels II Revised Regulation
By article 28 of BIIR, a judgment on parental responsibility which is enforceable in the member state where it was given shall be enforced in another member state when it has been declared enforceable there. (In the United Kingdom, this means the part of the United Kingdom where it has been registered.) By article 29, the application for such a declaration shall be submitted to the court appearing in the list notified by each member state to the Commission pursuant to article 68.
The High Court of Justice Principal Registry of the Family Division has been notified for this purpose.
Rule 31.4 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 provides that applications should be made to a district judge (as had previously been indicated should be the case by Thorpe LJ in In re S, above, at para 16).
By article 31, the court applied to must give its decision without delay and neither the person against whom enforcement is sought nor the child is entitled to make any submissions about it.
Although the application may be refused for one of the reasons set out in articles 22, 23 and 24, under no circumstances may a judgment be reviewed as to its substance (article 31.3).
In essence, therefore, this is intended to be a speedy ex parte (and essentially administrative) process.
The first opportunity for inter partes debate comes with the first appeal under article 33.
Under article 33.1, either party may appeal the decision on the application for a declaration.
Once again it is to be lodged with the court notified under article 68 (article 33.2).
The High Court of Justice Principal Registry of the Family Division has again been notified for this purpose, but rule 31.15(1) of the Family Procedure Rules provides that the appeal must be made to a judge of the High Court (again as advised by Thorpe LJ in In re S).
The appeal must be lodged within one month of service of the declaration, or two months if the person against whom enforcement is sought is habitually resident in a member state other than that where the declaration was given (article 33.5).
Once again, the need for speed is emphasised.
Then comes article 34, the provision which is crucial to this case: The judgment given on appeal may be contested only by the proceedings referred to in the list notified by each member state to the Commission pursuant to article 68.
Article 68 provides that member states shall notify to the Commission the lists of courts and redress procedures referred to (relevantly) in articles 29, 33 and 34 and any amendments thereto.
The Commission is to keep the information up to date and to make it publicly available.
The reference to the United Kingdom in its consolidated list of notifications reads as follows: The appeals provided for in article 34 may be brought only: in the United Kingdom, by a single further appeal on a point of law: (a) in England and Wales, to the Court of Appeal.
On the face of it, therefore, the position under BIIR is quite clear.
There is to be a largely formal first stage when (no doubt usually) the judgment is declared enforceable; there is to be a first appeal when the enforceability decision can be contested; and the decision on that appeal can only be contested by the notified proceedings.
It follows that if there were no notification under articles 34 and 68, as is the case with Cyprus and Malta, there would be no appeal possible under article 34.
The UKs notification expressly limits the proceedings to a single further appeal on a point of law which must be made, in England and Wales, to the Court of Appeal.
No mention is made of a further appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.
This too accords with the understanding of Thorpe LJ in In re section
The United Kingdom notification may be contrasted with the notification given by Ireland under articles 33 and 71 of Council Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations (the Maintenance Regulation).
Article 33 provides that the decision given on appeal may be contested only by the procedure notified by the member state concerned to the Commission in accordance with article 71.
Article 71 requires member states to communicate to the Commission the redress procedures referred to in article 33.
Irelands notification says this: An appeal on a point of law to the Court of Appeal (it should be noted, however, that in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Constitution, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction from a decision of the High Court if it is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances warranting a direct appeal to it.
The Supreme Court shall also have appellate jurisdiction from a decision of the Court of Appeal if it is satisfied that certain conditions laid down in the Constitution are satisfied.
It would appear, therefore, that at least one member state considers it possible to provide for two tiers of appeal from the first appeal.
It is not for this court to say whether that is consistent with either article 34 of BIIR or article 33 of the Maintenance Regulation.
Whether or not the United Kingdom could have provided for a further appeal to the Supreme Court, which some might think necessary if only to resolve inconsistent decisions in different parts of the United Kingdom concerning a Regulation which applies throughout, the fact remains that it did not do so.
Furthermore, the approach adopted by the United Kingdom in all previous European instruments concerned with the free movement of judgments and judicial cooperation within the European Union has been to provide for only one tier of further appeal.
The first of these was the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the 1968 Convention), concluded by the original six member states of the European Economic Community in 1968, later amended to include the United Kingdom.
The courts and methods of appeal are specified in article 37 of the Convention itself, in England and Wales the first appeal going to the High Court (or in the case of a maintenance judgment, to the magistrates court), and that decision being contested only by a single further appeal on a point of law.
As the official Explanatory Report comments, the object of the Convention was to ensure that the judgment given on the appeal may be contested only by an appeal in cassation and not by any other form of appeal or review (OJ 1979 C 59, pp 1, 51 52).
This was because An excessive number of avenues of appeal might be used by the losing party purely as delaying tactics, and this would constitute an obstacle to the free movement of judgments which is the object of the Convention.
Of course, this rationale only really applies to attempts by the person against whom enforcement is sought, such as the mother in this case, to resist enforcement, but what is sauce for the goose must also be sauce for the gander.
The 1968 Convention (along with its 1971 Protocol and the 1978 Convention on the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom to them both) was given effect in United Kingdom law by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982.
Interestingly, section 6(1) specifies that the single further appeal on a point of law lies in England and Wales either to the Court of Appeal or to the Supreme Court (formerly to the House of Lords) under the leap frog procedure provided for in the Administration of Justice Act 1969.
Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I Regulation) was designed to replace the 1968 Convention with directly applicable Community legislation.
The approach to avenues of challenge was the same, save that instead of containing each countrys permitted avenues in the text of the relevant articles, these referred to lists contained in Annexes to the Regulation.
Thus article 43.2 provided that the first appeal should be lodged with the court indicated in Annex III, which for England and Wales was the High Court of Justice (except for maintenance judgments); and article 44 provided that the judgment given on appeal might be contested only by the appeal referred to in Annex IV, which was once again a single further appeal on a point of law.
The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Order 2001 (SI 2001/3929) specified, once again, that in England and Wales this would lie either to the Court of Appeal or on a leap frog appeal to the House of Lords (article 4).
In 1998, the Council approved a Convention extending the scope of the Brussels regime to matrimonial matters.
This took the same approach to the methods of challenging enforcement applications as had the 1968 Convention.
The 1998 Convention never became applicable but was the source of the 2000 Council Regulation (EC) 1347/2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses (the Brussels II Regulation), which was the immediate predecessor to the BIIR Regulation.
This adopted the same method as the Brussels I Regulation was to adopt some seven months later.
Article 26.2 provided that the first appeal should be lodged with the court listed in Annex II, which for England and Wales was the High Court of Justice.
Article 27 provided that the judgment given on appeal might be contested only by the proceedings listed in Annex III, which for the UK was by a single further appeal on a point of law.
However, the European Communities (Matrimonial Jurisdiction and Judgments) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/310), unlike the 2001 Order relating to the Brussels I Regulation, did not specify what was meant by a single further appeal on a point of law, nor did the new Chapter 5 of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991, introduced by article 29 of the Family Proceedings (Amendment) Rules 2001 (SI 2001/821) to cater for the Brussels II Regulation.
However, BIIR, which replaced the Brussels II Regulation, adopts a slightly different technique.
Instead of describing the appeal processes in the text, or in Annexes, it provides for each member state to communicate the avenues of first appeal and further contestation to the Commission thus enabling member states to change the processes without the need to revise the Regulation.
Unlike both the Brussels II and the Brussels I Regulations, BIIR does not contain either in its main text or in Annexes a reference to a single further appeal on a point of law.
There is no express limit in article 34 to the number of proceedings whereby the judgment on the first appeal may be contested (although article 35 refers to the appeal under article 34 rather than an appeal).
This more flexible approach is also taken in the 2009 Maintenance Regulation (which removed maintenance obligations from the scope of the Brussels I Regulation).
While article 33 provides that the decision given on first appeal may be contested only by the procedure notified in accordance with article 71, article 71 requires member states to communicate the redress procedures referred to in article 33.
For what it is worth, the recast version of the Brussels I Regulation, Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, also adopts this more flexible technique.
Article 50 provides that the judgment given on the first appeal can only be contested by an appeal where the courts with which any further appeal is to be lodged have been communicated to the Commission under article 75(c), which also refers to courts.
The United Kingdom has retained the previous reference (for England and Wales) to an appeal either to the Court of Appeal or under the leap frog procedure to the Supreme Court.
The purpose of all these instruments is that, save in very narrowly defined circumstances, member states should recognise and enforce one anothers judgments.
The recitals to BIIR are typical: The European Community has set the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is ensured (Recital 1).
The recognition and enforcement of judgments given in a member state should be based on the principle of mutual trust and the grounds for non recognition should be kept to the minimum required (Recital 21).
From the very outset, in 1968, member states were anxious that there should not be too many avenues and methods of challenging enforcement decisions, hence the restriction to cassation type further appeals.
It may well be, as Mr Richard Harrison QC has argued very ably on behalf of the father, that the strict approach taken in the earlier instruments has had to give way to the more flexible approach taken more recently.
It may well be that it would be open to the United Kingdom to do as Ireland has done and notify the possibility, not only of leap frog appeals from the High Court to the Supreme Court, but also of appeals from the Courts of Appeal in each part of the United Kingdom to the Supreme Court.
The fact remains that it has not done so.
It is also true to say that the policy of the United Kingdom has not been entirely consistent.
In relation to civil and commercial judgments, the 1968 Convention, the Brussels I Regulation and the recast Brussels I Regulation provide for the possibility of either an appeal to the Court of Appeal or a leap frog appeal to the House of Lords or Supreme Court (thus, it would appear, giving the Supreme Court jurisdiction where the Court of Appeal has gone wrong in law in an earlier case, but not if it does so in the current case).
It has not been possible to discover why a different approach, excluding the House of Lords or Supreme Court altogether, was taken in relation to family matters in the Brussels II Regulation and BIIR.
It is known that the President of the Family Division, the Solicitors Family Law Association, The Law Society, the Family Law Bar Association, Reunite, Pact, and the Child Abduction Unit in the Office of the Official Solicitor were consulted on the Commissions revised draft text of BIIR and that the Lord Chancellors Department continued to consult the President of the Family Division, Thorpe LJ (Chairman of the Presidents International Committee), senior practitioners and Reunite during the negotiations.
But it is not known precisely how and why the decision was taken to adopt the new approach in article 34 or how and why the United Kingdom government chose to make the notification which it did.
The Minutes of the International Family Law Committee of the Family Justice Council held on 8 November 2004, at which the proposed BIIR was discussed, do not record any discussion of these matters.
But it is not surprising that the notification was to the same effect as Annex III to the Brussels II Regulation, nor is it unlikely that limiting the scope for multiple appeals was seen as an important consideration.
The fact remains that the United Kingdom did make the notification in question.
The question, therefore, is whether BIIR, combined with that notification, is effective to restrict what would otherwise be the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under section 40 of the 2005 Act.
The effect of BIIR in United Kingdom law
Mr Harrison faces the serious difficulty that article 34 clearly states that the decision on appeal may only be contested by the notified proceedings.
On the face of it, therefore, as Mr Hugh Mercer QC submits on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, if there were no relevant notification, there would be no possibility of further challenge (as is apparently the case with Cyprus and Malta).
Mr Harrison seeks to avoid this problem in two ways.
First, he argues that the notification, being an act of the executive without any Parliamentary scrutiny or approval, cannot be an enactment for the purpose of section 40(6).
He is of course quite correct that the executive has no power to amend or qualify primary or delegated legislation unless Parliament has given it the power to do so.
An example is the power given by the United Nations Act 1946 to make Orders in Council without Parliamentary scrutiny where necessary to comply with the United Kingdoms obligations under the United Nations Charter.
Express language would be required for such a power to permit the executive to abrogate fundamental rights such as the right of access to a court: see A v HM Treasury (JUSTICE intervening) [2010] UKSC 2; [2010] 2 AC 534.
In fact, such delegated legislative powers are far more frequently exercised by statutory instrument which has to be laid before, and in some cases positively approved by, Parliament.
It is also correct that the power to amend primary legislation and otherwise to legislate for the purpose of complying with the United Kingdoms obligations in European Union law, conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, has to be exercised by Order in Council or by orders, rules, regulations or schemes.
The notification was none of these things.
By itself, therefore, it could not be effective to amend or qualify section 40(2) of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.
However, we are concerned, not with the notification alone, but with the combined effect of article 34 of BIIR and the notification.
It is trite law that European Regulations are directly applicable in all member states without the need for further legislative implementation there: Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, article 288.
It was, of course, necessary for the United Kingdom to legislate to make this treaty provision the law in the United Kingdom.
This it did by section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972: (1) All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly;
Furthermore, by section 2(4): (4) any enactment passed or to be passed shall be construed and have effect subject to the foregoing provisions
of this section
Thus, Parliament has decreed that its own legislation is to have effect subject to the requirements of directly applicable European Union law.
This includes section 40(2) of the 2005 Act.
Mr Harrison is therefore driven to argue that articles 34 and 68 of BIIR are not, in fact, directly applicable.
This is because they require measures of application to be adopted by member states in order to be implemented.
He relies, in particular, on the cases of Azienda Agricola Monte Arcosu Srl v Regione Autonoma Della Sardegna and Others (Case C 403/98) [2001] ECR I 103; [2002] 2 CMLR 14 and OBB Personenverkehr AG v Schienen Control Kommission (Case C 509/11) [2014] 1 CMLR 51.
His best example is the OBB case, which concerned a Regulation (1371/2007) providing for rail passengers to be compensated for delay.
Under article 30, each member state was to designate a body responsible for enforcing the Regulation.
But the Regulation did not define the specific measures which that body had to be able to adopt to secure compliance.
The relevant body in Austria, the Kommission, required the railway company, OBB, to alter the terms and conditions of its tickets so as to comply with the compensation requirements of article 17 of the Regulation.
But under Austrian law the Kommission did not have the power to do so.
The Court held that article 30 by itself did not give it the power to impose terms on the railway company. (I note that it would be a completely separate question whether the passenger could rely on the direct effect of the Regulation in order to claim the compensation which it prescribed.)
The Azienda case concerned Regulation No 797/85, which provided for certain payments to farmers practising farming as [their] main occupation.
Member states were required to define what that meant, both for natural and non natural persons.
The relevant Italian law defined it for individuals and certain other entities, such as farming co operatives, but did not provide for limited companies at all.
The Court held that, as the Regulation required a definition before it could be operated, a limited company conducting farming operations could not make claims under the Regulation.
The principle was stated thus: 26.
In this respect, although, by virtue of the very nature of regulations and of their function in the system of sources of Community law, the provisions of those regulations generally have immediate effect in the national legal systems without its being necessary for the national authorities to adopt measures of application, some of their provisions may nonetheless necessitate, for their implementation, the adoption of measures of application by the member states.
Thus, says Mr Harrison, as articles 34 and 68 of BIIR required further measures of implementation in the form of notifications by the member states, they cannot be directly applicable.
The simple answer to this argument is that articles 34 and 68 are not comparable with the articles under consideration in these two cases.
Article 34 does not depend for its implementation upon the member states choice of avenue of appeal.
If the member state fails to notify any such avenue of appeal, then none will exist.
But in any event, the member state in question did make a relevant notification.
There is nothing in these cases to suggest that, if the required measures of implementation are adopted in a member state, the Regulation is not directly applicable there (and indeed effective to create individual rights).
The farmers who were covered by the Italian definition would no doubt have been able to claim their rights under the Regulation.
Mr Harrisons final argument is that the notification cannot be effective if it does not give an accurate picture of the appellate rights under United Kingdom law.
Article 68 requires member states to supply information as to the position in their country; it does not permit them to change the position as it would otherwise be.
However, so to interpret article 68 would run counter to the purpose of the provisions relating to routes of challenge which date back to the 1968 Convention and continue through all the European instruments discussed earlier.
This is to limit the avenues and methods of appeal so as to avoid delays and manoeuvrings which will defeat the object of effective enforcement of one anothers orders.
This object may have become slightly diluted in the more recent instruments, but the Regulation clearly contemplates the possibility that Member States will make notifications which cut down the routes of appeal which would otherwise be available.
Conclusion
I am therefore satisfied that the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in this case.
The appeal which has been lodged should therefore be struck out.
","These proceedings concern a child, called DD in the judgment, who was born in 2006 in Romania, to Romanian parents who met while working in England.
The family returned to England after the birth.
The parents separated in 2007 and DD has lived in England since then in the care of his mother.
The father returned to Romania in 2009 but has maintained a significant relationship with his son.
He commenced divorce and custody proceedings in Romania in 2007 which, after long delays, culminated in a decision of the Bucharest Court of Appeal in November 2013 that DD should live with his father.
The father applied for the recognition and enforcement of this custody order by the English court in February 2014.
These proceedings are governed by the Brussels II (Revised) Regulation (BIIR).
DD was made a party.
In July 2014 a High Court judge refused the fathers application, applying article 23(b) BIIR which provides that a judgment should not be recognised if it was given, except in a case of urgency, without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of the member state in which recognition was sought.
The Romanian court had not made direct or indirect enquiry of DD regarding his wishes and feelings.
The Court of Appeal upheld the judges order.
The father sought to pursue a further appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court considered as a preliminary issue whether it had jurisdiction to hear an appeal against an order for the enforcement of a custody order in proceedings governed by BIIR.
The Supreme Court unanimously rules that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the fathers appeal, which must therefore be struck out.
Lady Hale gives the only substantive judgment.
Under s 40 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, appeals to the Supreme Court are subject to provision under any other enactment restricting such an appeal.
The question therefore is whether the provisions of BIIR constitute such an enactment or otherwise override the jurisdiction granted to the Supreme Court by s 40 [12].
The application to register a judgment governed by BIIR is intended to be a speedy and essentially administrative process.
Either party may appeal the decision under article 33, which is subject to the provision in article 34 that the judgment given on such an appeal may be contested only by the proceedings referred to in the list notified by each member state to the Commission pursuant to article 68.
The UK has provided in its list of notifications under article 68 that appeals in England and Wales
under article 34 may be brought only by a single further appeal on a point of law to the Court of Appeal [16].
It has been the practice of the UK in several previous European instruments concerned with the free movement of judgments and judicial cooperation to provide for only one tier of further appeal.
The purpose of this restriction is to further the intention of these instruments that member states should recognise and enforce each others judgments without too many avenues for challenge [26].
The provisions of BIIR and the notification under article 68 are directly applicable in the UK.
Article 34 does not depend for its implementation upon the member states choice of avenue of appeal and in any event the UK did make a notification [37].
It is not necessary for the notification to reflect all appellate rights under UK law: to further the objective of BIIR, article 68 permits member states to make notifications which cut down the routes of appeal which would otherwise be available [38].
It follows that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal in this case and the appeal is struck out.
"
uksc-2011-0117,"This appeal raises a short point under Part VII of the Housing Act 1996.
The 1996 Act contains a set of provisions dealing with the obligations for housing authorities to those found to be homeless or threatened with homelessness.
They were originally enacted in the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977.
Although there have been significant amendments, the general structure of the provisions has remained largely unaltered, as has the underlying principle that a home is somewhere which can accommodate a family together.
Thus in Din (Taj) v Wandsworth London Borough Council [1983] AC 657, Lord Fraser said: One of the main purposes of that Act was to secure that, when accommodation is provided for homeless persons by the housing authority, it should be made available for all the members of his family together and to end the practice which had previously been common under which adult members of a homeless family were accommodated in a hostels while children were taken into care and the family thus split up . (p 668 D G)
That principle is clearly established in the first two sections.
Homelessness is defined by section 175(1) as follows: (1) A person is homeless if he has no accommodation available for his occupation, in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, which he (a) is entitled to occupy by virtue of an interest in it or by virtue of an order of court, (b) has an express or implied licence to occupy, or (c) occupies as a residence by virtue of any enactment or rule of law giving him the right to remain in occupation or restricting the right of another person to recover possession (2) . (3) A person shall not be treated as having accommodation unless it is accommodation which it would be reasonable for him to continue to occupy.
By section 176: Accommodation shall be regarded as available for a persons occupation only if it is available for occupation by him together with (a) any other person who normally resides with him as a member of his family, or (b) any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him.
References in this Part to securing that accommodation is available for a persons occupation shall be construed accordingly.
Thus what I shall call the extended meaning of available for his occupation, as defined by section 176, runs through the whole of Part VII of the 1996 Act.
It is relevant not only in establishing whether a person is homeless under section 175, but also for setting the authoritys duty towards him if so found, including both their interim duty to provide accommodation pending a decision (section 188(1)), and (as in the present case) their final duty to someone found to be in a priority need and not intentionally homeless (section 193(2)).
By contrast, no specific standard of accommodation has been laid down by Parliament.
As Lord Brightman said in R v Hillingdon LBC ex p. Puhlhofer [1986] AC 484, discussing the 1977 Act: In this situation, Parliament plainly, and wisely, placed no qualifying adjective before the word accommodation in section 1 or section 4 of the Act, and none is to be implied.
The word appropriate or reasonable is not to be imported.
Nor is accommodation not accommodation because it might in certain circumstances be unfit for habitation for the purposes of Part II of the Housing Act 1957 or might involve overcrowding within the meaning of Part IV.
Those particular statutory criteria are not to be imported into the Homeless Persons Act for any purpose.
What is properly to be regarded as accommodation is a question of fact to be decided by the local authority.
There are no rules.
Clearly some places in which a person might choose or be constrained to live could not properly be regarded as accommodation at all .
What the local authority have to consider, in reaching a decision whether a person is homeless for the purposes of the Act, is whether he has what can properly be described as accommodation within the ordinary meaning of that word in the English language. (p 517 E G) He added that, while the statutory definition of overcrowding had no relevance, overcrowding was not necessarily a factor to be disregarded altogether: accommodation must, by definition, be capable of accommodating.
If, therefore, a place is properly capable of being regarded as accommodation from an objective standpoint, but is so small a space that it is incapable of accommodating the applicant together with other persons who normally reside with him as members of his family, then on the facts of such a case the applicant would be homeless because he would have no accommodation in any relevant sense. (pp 517 H 518 A)
Some of Lord Brightmans assumptions about the intentions of Parliament
seem to have been falsified shortly afterwards.
Section 14 of the Housing and Planning Act 1986 introduced a requirement to disregard accommodation which it is not reasonable for him to continue to occupy (see now section 175(3) of the 1996 Act, quoted above).
It also introduced a requirement that accommodation provided by the authority should be suitable (see now section 206(1) of the 1996 Act).
In determining suitability the authority were required to have regard to the statutory provisions covering housing standards (see now section 210 of the 1996 Act).
To that extent it mitigated the apparent harshness of the test laid down by the House of Lords in Puhlhofer.
However it did not alter the definition of accommodation as such, nor detract from the authority of what Lord Brightman said about that word taken on its own.
The issue in this case, in short, is to what extent (if at all) the extended meaning of the expression available for his occupation in the 1996 Act implies a requirement that the family be accommodated not only together, but in a single unit of accommodation.
Factual background
The facts are sufficiently summarised in the agreed statement of facts and issues: On 3 June 2004, the Appellants, the London Borough of Camden (the Council) accepted a full duty to secure that suitable accommodation was available for occupation by the Respondent, Ms Sharif, under s.193(2), Housing Act 1996.
The Council accepted that Ms Sharifs father, Mr Sharif Ali, a man in his 60s with some health problems, and her sister, Zainab Sharif (aged 14), lived with Ms Sharif and were therefore part of her household.
Accordingly Ms Sharifs father and sister are entitled to be accommodated with Ms Sharif under the said housing duty.
Ms Sharif and her household were initially accommodated by the Council in hostel accommodation but, in 2004, they were accommodated also under s.193(2) at 83 Lopen Road, London N18 1PT (a 3 bedroom house) under a private sector leasing scheme.
On 6 November 2009, still by way of accommodation under section 193(2), the Council asked Ms Sharif and the household to move to two units (nos. 125 and 132) on the same floor of Englands Lane Residence, London NW3, a hostel used by the Council to accommodate homeless applicants.
Each unit comprised a single bed sitting room with cooking facilities, plus bathroom/w.c.
The two units were separated by a few yards. no. 125 can accommodate two single people; no. 132 is suitable for one.
It was envisaged that Ms Sharif and her sister would sleep in no. 125 and their father in no. 132.
Ms Sharif refused the offer as unsuitable, because it comprised two separate units; due to her fathers medical condition they needed to be able to live as a family in the same unit.
On 23 December 2009 the council confirmed that the offer was considered suitable, although not an ideal living arrangement, and that accordingly their housing obligation to her had come to an end (see section 193(5) of the 1996 Act).
Ms Sharif requested a review of the decision on suitability, again mainly on the grounds of her fathers ill health and the need to provide care for him.
It does not seem to have been suggested that lack of communal facilities as such was an issue.
On 16 February 2010 the council upheld their decision.
The review decision contained a detailed consideration of the facts, including the medical advice received by the Council, which in some respects differed from assertions made on behalf of Ms Sharif.
In particular, the reviewing officer was not persuaded that the distance between the two units was a significant problem: I am not persuaded that your client would experience any significant difficulties in attending her father in a separate flat which your client agrees herself was only a few yards away.
Walking from one flat to another and cleaning on her fathers behalf when necessary would not in my view have been any more challenging than cleaning a three bedroom house and walking up and down the stairs in the house.
I am therefore not persuaded that the accommodation offered to your client was unsuitable as it would be more onerous caring for her sister and father in two separate flats.
At this stage the sole issue was that of suitability; it was not suggested that accommodation in two units was as a matter of law incapable of satisfying the statutory requirement.
Ms Sharif appealed to the London Central County Court on various points of law (both procedural and substantive), as she was entitled to do by virtue of section 204 of the 1996 Act.
The present issue was raised for the first time by an amendment to the original grounds of appeal in the following terms: On a proper construction of section 176 Housing Act 1996 it is not lawful for the authority to purport to discharge its duty to secure accommodation for the appellant under Part VII of the Housing Act by providing separate accommodation for her father being a person who normally resides with her as part of her family.
The appeal was dismissed on 24 June 2010 by HH Judge Mitchell.
He took note in particular of a judgment of Scott Baker J in R v Ealing London Borough Council ex parte Surdonja [1999] 1 ALL ER 566.
In that case the family were housed in two hostels approximately a mile apart.
Noting that the council were obliged to provide accommodation available not only for the claimant but also for his family, the judge had said: In my judgment the obligation is not discharged by providing split accommodation in separate dwellings.
It is the policy of the law that families should be kept together; they should be able to live together as a unit.
I can well see that the obligation could be discharged by, for example, separate rooms in the same hotel, but not I think in two entirely separate hostels up to a mile apart. (p 571).
HH Judge Mitchell saw this as indicating Scott Baker Js view that the obligation could be fulfilled by offering split accommodation within the same building.
He saw that as consistent with the statutory language which required the provision of suitable accommodation, not necessarily accommodation suitable from the perspective of the claimant.
That decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal (Jacob, Wilson and Etherton LJJ) [2011] PTSR 1695.
Etherton LJ, who had granted permission to appeal, also gave the only substantive judgment.
His essential reasoning is encapsulated in the following passage: 17 The accommodation offered by Camden to the applicant comprised two self contained flats, on the same floor of the building, but a short distance apart, one of which was offered for occupation by the applicant and her sister and the other by her father.
On any ordinary use of language, that was not the provision of accommodation which the applicant and her father were to occupy together with one another.
They would be living close by each other, but separate from one another.
No one could reasonably describe them, in such circumstances, as living together with one another.
That ordinary meaning of the legislative language is reflected in the wording of section 176(a) which refers to a person who normally resides with the applicant.
It seems reasonable to suppose that concepts of occupation by the applicant together with another, and residence of the applicant with that other, were intended by Parliament to have a similar meaning.
It cannot be said, on any ordinary use of language, that persons living in separate self contained flats, however close, and not sharing any communal area, are residing together. (emphasis added)
He considered and rejected a number of submissions made on behalf of the council, which it is unnecessary to repeat in detail.
In relation to the judgment in Surdonja, Etherton LJ commented, in para 36, that the reference to separate rooms in the same hotel was quite different from occupation of separate self contained residential units with no sharing of any living areas.
He added: 38.
I recognise, without hesitation, the enormous difficulties faced by housing authorities in attempting to discharge their housing duties, including those under Part VII of the 1996 Act.
Their shortage of housing stock and limited resources and the scale of the problem of homelessness are well known to be acute.
It is obvious that anything which constrains the ability of the authorities to exercise discretion in the management and application of those limited resources and stock will increase the practical difficulties in discharging their duties.
The policy underlying the provisions of Part VII is, however, a matter for Parliament to determine.
That policy is to be ascertained in the usual way by a proper interpretation of the statutory language.
It is well established and common ground that the policy underlying section 176 of the 1996 Act is to keep families together.
The natural meaning of the language used in section 176 is that the policy is to be achieved by the provision of accommodation in which the applicant can reside together with those members of the applicants family who normally reside with the applicant, and not by the provision of two or more separate self contained units of accommodation without any sharing of communal living areas.
To strain the clear language of section 176 in order to enable housing authorities to have greater latitude in the management of their limited resources, by reducing the issue solely to one of suitability in the authoritys view (subject to Wednesbury principles), would be wrong in principle, as a judicial modification of Parliaments policy. (para 38)
The issues in the appeal
Mr Arden QC for the council submits that Etherton LJs construction of the statute went beyond what the words justified and would impose an unwarranted burden on the authority.
He accepted that one of the social purposes behind the statute was to ensure that families could be kept together.
However, that did not necessarily mean in one unit.
The correct question to ask was whether the accommodation, even if not in a single unit, was sufficiently proximate to fulfil that social purpose.
In other words, could the family be described as living together even if accommodated in what was technically more than one unit of accommodation? That interpretation was consistent with the history of the legislation and in particular the judgment of Lord Brightman in Puhlhofer.
The council was particularly concerned at the suggestion that the statutory requirement could only be satisfied by the provision of communal living areas.
Such a requirement would be novel to housing law generally, and there was no proper basis for importing it into this Part of the Act.
Mr Arden referred also to the decision of the House of Lords in Uratemp Ventures Ltd v Collins [2002] AC 301, relating to the definition of a dwelling house let as a separate dwelling in section 1 of the Housing Act 1988.
It was there held that a single room, even without cooking facilities could constitute a dwelling house as defined in the 1988 Act.
Lord Millett said: In both ordinary and literary usage, residential accommodation is a dwelling if it is the occupiers home But his home is not the less his home because he does not cook there but prefers to eat out or bring in ready cooked meals. (para 31).
By analogy, he submitted, neither the word accommodation nor the expression living together can in themselves be read as containing any implication as to the nature of the facilities to be provided.
For the respondent, Ms Lieven QC supports the judgment of the Court of Appeal.
She accepts that Etherton LJ may have gone too far in suggesting that there need to be communal living areas.
However she supports his essential reasoning, based on the ordinary use of language.
The accommodation must be available for living together.
That implies there must at least be somewhere in the accommodation where living together can take place.
The test is objective rather than subjective.
It is an issue of law on which, at least where the primary facts are not in issue, the court is able to substitute its view for that of the authority.
The layout must be such as to facilitate normal family life for those within the scope of the section.
That will normally imply a single unit of accommodation, but she accepts that it may be possible to accommodate a family in two rooms in a hostel, provided there is a space where some degree of shared family life can take place, even if that is limited to some shared cooking facilities.
Discussion
This is a short point which does not permit of much elaboration.
Etherton LJ relied on what he considered to be the ordinary meaning of the statutory language.
In my respectful view, the ordinary meaning does not support that interpretation.
The word accommodation in itself is neutral.
It is not in its ordinary sense to be equated with unit of accommodation.
It is no abuse of language to speak of a family being accommodated in two adjoining flats.
The limitation, if any, must therefore be found in the words available for occupation together with the other members of his family.
The statutory test will be satisfied by a single unit of accommodation in which a family can live together.
But it may also be satisfied by two units of accommodation if they are so located that they enable the family to live together in practical terms.
In the end, as Mr Arden submits, this comes down to an issue of fact, or of factual judgment, for the authority.
Short of irrationality it is unlikely to raise any issue of law for the court.
This legal issue had not been addressed in terms by the Review Officer, because it had not been raised in that form.
However, it is reasonably clear how it would have been answered, since the issue of suitability was clearly treated as including the needs of the family as a unit.
The main obstacle to family living which had been raised was the problem of caring for the father in a separate unit.
That was considered and discounted by the officer.
He thought the two flats were sufficiently close for the problem of communication to be no greater than in a house on two levels.
Ms Lievens submissions seem like an echo of those of counsel for the unsuccessful appellant in Puhlhofer, who submitted that: in order to constitute accommodation the premises must be such as to enable the family unit to reside and carry on the ordinary operations of daily life there . (p 505B).
Any such qualification was rejected by the House.
That remains the position, save to the extent that it is implicit in the requirements of suitability or reasonableness, introduced in 1986.
But those points are not, or are no longer, in issue in the present case.
Further, Ms Lievens interpretation would produce surprising results.
It is to be remembered that the statutory definition of overcrowding is not relevant to the definition of accommodation available for occupation, although it is now relevant to suitability.
Under the Puhlhofer test, a family might be properly accommodated within a single unit even though seriously overcrowded by normal standards.
But on Ms Leivens submission, the authority would not have been able to improve its position by offering it an additional unit next door.
It also has to be remembered that the same definition applies to the temporary accommodation to be provided while a decision is made on the merits of the claim.
It would be odd and potentially onerous if, even while the authority were simply considering the merits of the claimants position, they were unable to house the family in two adjoining units even on a temporary basis.
Furthermore, if as seems to be accepted, the observations of Scott Baker J in Surdonja were correct, it is hard to see why two rooms on different floors of a hotel or hostel would satisfy the council's duty, but two adjacent flats would not.
The presence of locked doors between adjacent flats also cannot be critical as rooms in a hotel or hostel would normally have their own lock.
As to Ms Lievens suggestion that shared cooking facilities might be sufficient, I accept that the observations of Lord Millett in Uratemp (quoted above) may not be of much relevance to what is needed to accommodate a family living together, as opposed to a single person.
In this case there were cooking facilities in both flats.
In practice no doubt they would be shared, particularly if as was suggested the father had limited ability safely to cook for himself.
It would be very odd if removal of a cooker from one flat, so as to leave no option but shared use, would convert what would otherwise be inadequate provision of accommodation into a valid discharge of the authoritys duties.
Of the other cases to which we were referred, I would mention only one: Langford Property Co Ltd v Goldrich [1949] 1 KB 511.
The issue under the Rent Acts was whether two self contained flats let together could constitute a separate dwelling house.
The facts were described in the judgment of Somervell LJ.
The premises consisted of two flats in a single block, which had previously been separately let.
They were on the same floor but not next to each other.
The tenant had taken these two flats as a home for himself and some relatives . his father, mother and a married sister.
He made no structural alterations (p 521).
It was held that they could be treated as constituting together a dwelling house.
The Lord Justice said: In my opinion if the facts justify such a finding, two flats or, indeed, so far as I can see, two houses, could be let as a separate dwelling house within the meaning of the definition.
What happened here was that the tenant wished to accommodate in his home these relatives to whom I have referred, and he wanted more accommodation than could be found or conveniently found in one flat.
He therefore took the two flats and made those two flats his home. [Counsel] suggested at one time that there might be some absurdity, if, say, a man took under a single lease (which does not seem very probable) two flats in widely separated districts; but that case can be dealt with when it arises. (p 517)
Care is always needed in drawing parallels between definitions in different statutory codes.
However I find this passage helpful in relation to the ordinary use of language in a closely analogous context.
Somervell LJ saw no difficulty in describing the two flats as accommodation, in which the family were able to make their home.
He distinguished the position where the flats are in widely separated districts.
This approach is very similar to that of Scott Baker J in the passage I have cited.
Submissions were made to us, on the one hand, as to the serious problems authorities would face in meeting their statutory duties, if the Court of Appeals judgment were upheld; and, on the other, as to the risks of allowing authorities too free a hand in the way in which they can accommodate families.
I find it unnecessary to comment in detail on either aspect.
Although the problems of housing authorities, particularly in urban areas, are well known, there is no specific evidence to support a submission that this particular requirement would pose unacceptable problems.
Mr Arden rightly accepted that, if the law was as the Court of Appeal said it was, the authority will have to comply.
In relation to the second point, I would emphasise the narrowness of the present decision.
It does not give authorities a free hand.
It is still a fundamental objective of the Act to ensure that families can live together in the true sense.
Accommodation, whether in one unit or two, is not suitable unless it enables that objective to be achieved.
I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the judges order.
LORD HOPE
I too would allow the appeal for the reasons given by Lord Carnwath.
We are all agreed that the test which section 176 of the Housing Act 1996 lays down will be satisfied by a single unit of accommodation in which a family can live together.
The question is whether the words available for occupation by him together with the other persons referred to can only be so satisfied.
Do they permit the local authority to accommodate the family in more than one unit of accommodation, so long as it can be said that the units are close enough for them to live together? The words resides with and reside with that follow the phrase I have just quoted serve to emphasise that the accommodation that the test refers to must be such as to enable them all to live together as a family.
But the test does not go further than that.
It does not say that it can only be met by the provision of a single unit.
Parliament has plainly and wisely, if I may adopt Lord Brightmans phrase in R v Hillingdon LBC, Ex p Puhlhofer [1986] AC 484 at 517, refrained from inserting any qualifying words of that kind.
In this situation the question whether the test has been met must be a question for the local authority.
There are, nevertheless, two yardsticks that can be applied.
The first is what must be taken to be the ordinary meaning of the words that the test uses.
The second is the practical one, which follows on the first.
Can it be said, in a practical sense, that all the members of the family are living together, although more than one unit is required to accommodate them? The provision of separate units is not, of course, ideal.
Some measure of inconvenience is bound to result if a single unit cannot be found.
But Parliament has recognised, by refraining from laying down strict rules, that the situations that may confront the local authority will vary from case to case and that it would be unreasonable to prescribe one solution that must be adopted in all cases.
The test is not there to be exploited.
It must be applied reasonably and proportionately.
So long as that is done, the aim of the test will have been satisfied.
LADY HALE
I agree that this appeal should be allowed, for the reasons given by Lord
Carnwath.
I understand that this will seem very harsh to a family who had been housed since 2004 in a three bed roomed house under a private sector leasing scheme and were then expected to accept much less spacious accommodation.
But the suitability of that accommodation is no longer in issue.
The only issue is whether it is available for Ms Sharif to occupy together with her father and her younger sister.
If one accepts that it is open to a local authority to accommodate members of a family in separate rooms in the same hostel or hotel, sharing cooking and/or bathroom facilities with others, then one must accept that it is possible to accommodate them in separate small flats like these, provided that the flats are close enough together to enable them to eat and share time together as a family.
There are passages in the judgment of Etherton LJ which appear to suggest that members of a family are only accommodated together if they have some shared communal living space, in the sense of a shared living room.
That would, of course, be ideal.
And, as was pointed out in Birmingham City Council v Ali; Moran v Manchester City Council [2009] UKSC 36, [2009] 1 WLR 1506, what is suitable for a family to occupy in the short term may not be suitable for them to occupy for a longer period.
But we are not concerned with suitability here.
To require some communal living space is to impose a standard which is too high to expect local authorities to meet across the whole range of statutory provisions to which the together with criterion applies, including the interim duty in section 188 of the 1996 Act.
Many of the hotels and hostels currently used to accommodate homeless people do not have a communal living room.
It is not surprising, therefore, that Mr Arden, on behalf of the local authority, was particularly concerned about this aspect of the Court of Appeals judgment.
No doubt many of us would wish that there were a much larger supply of affordable housing to enable homeless families to be accommodated in the way which we would ideally wish them to be accommodated.
But there is not and the law does not require local authorities to meet a minimum standard which in practice it would be impossible for many of them to provide.
LORD KERR (dissenting)
A home is where a family lives together.
The family unit may comprise many generations or it may consist of merely two people.
But at its heart and foundation lies the family home where its members share experiences and live their lives together.
This is why the notion of providing accommodation for a family to live as a single unit, not dispersed or living apart, occupies such a central place in the homelessness legislation of the last century.
The Housing Act 1996 imposes a duty to provide accommodation which is available to be occupied by one person together with members of his or her family.
The legislation clearly contemplates that the accommodation should be provided to an individual.
But it is also intended that the accommodation provided to that person should be capable of housing all the members of that persons family together.
That idea is buttressed by the requirement in section 176 of joint occupation.
Accommodation is only to be regarded as available for occupation if it is available for occupation by the person to whom it is provided together with any person who normally resides with him as a member of his family.
There is nothing in the legislation which suggests or implies that the statutory duty will be fulfilled by providing accommodation which, taken in combination with other accommodation, is capable of housing together all the members of the family.
Nor does the legislation authorise the provision of different units of accommodation which a family, if well disposed to do so, can use on different occasions for shared family activities.
If living together as a family is to mean anything, it must mean living as a distinct entity in a single unit of accommodation.
Ms Lieven QC was right to submit that the language of section 176 calls for focus on the accommodation, not on the use to which a particular family might put it.
The accommodation must be of a character that will allow all members of the family to live together within it.
She was also right that section 176 imposes an objective requirement, namely, that the accommodation is, as a matter of fact, capable of occupation by the members of the family together.
Togetherness in this context connotes a combination of people into a condition of unity.
There must be a single unit of accommodation to provide for that condition.
The appellant suggested that the local authority may exercise a judgment as to whether a series of units are suitable to permit members of the same family to live in a condition of sufficient proximity so that they can function as a family unit. (One may observe, as an aside, that sufficient proximity is quite different as a concept, and may be diametrically different in practice, from living together.) The appellant advanced this argument by seeking to assimilate the duty under section 176 with other Part 7 duties.
This is misconceived.
Ms Lieven was again right in her submission that other Part 7 duties, where they involve an element of discretion, are expressly provided with that facility in the language of the Act.
The duty under section 176 is quite different.
It is an obligation to provide accommodation, the physical dimensions of which are sufficient to allow it to be occupied by the person to whom it is made available together with the members of his or her family.
Some limited judgment may be exercised by the local authority in discharging that duty but that judgment is geared to the essentially factual exercise of deciding if the accommodation meets those physical requirements.
It has been said that Etherton LJ went too far in suggesting that a feature of the accommodation, to meet the requirements of section 176, had to be the provision of a communal space where family activities could be enjoyed and shared.
I rather think that Etherton LJ, in his reference to a communal space, was emphasising the lack of such a feature as an indication of the incapacity of the accommodation offered to meet the statutory requirements rather than identifying it as an invariably indispensable requirement.
In any event, this does not affect the principal issue.
This is that there should be physical accommodation capable of being occupied as a single unit by the person for whom it is provided together with the members of his or her family.
It is of course desirable that such a unit should have a communal space where family activities could be enjoyed but I do not consider that this is something which the statute affirmatively requires.
Much was made by the appellant of the considerable constraints that would be placed on local authorities if they were required to house families in single units and were not afforded the opportunity to exercise judgment as to their accommodation in different units.
No evidence was provided to support these (to my mind, at least) somewhat unlikely claims.
No suggestion was made that any local authority had accommodated families in this way on any widespread basis in the past.
Notably, there is nothing in the Code of Guidance: Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities (2006) which recommends the practice.
But if the opportunity is available to house families in different living units, there is every reason to suppose that local authorities, with the pressures that are placed on them to meet housing need, will, perfectly understandably, seek to exploit that opportunity to the fullest extent.
There is therefore a real risk that one of the principal purposes of the legislation (that of bringing and keeping families together) will be, if not undermined, at least put under considerable strain.
I would dismiss the appeal.
","This appeal concerns the interpretation of a provision of the Housing Act 1996 (the 1996 Act) relating to the duties of local housing authorities to provide accommodation for those who are, or claim to be, homeless or threatened with homelessness.
Section 175 of the 1996 Act states, in essence, that a person is homeless if he has no accommodation available for his occupation in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.
According to section 176, accommodation is to be regarded as available for a persons occupation only if it is available for occupation by him together with any other person who normally resides with him as a member of his family, or any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him [3].
The phrase available for his occupation is relevant not only to establishing whether a person is homeless for the purposes of the 1996 Act, but also to identifying what duties a local authority owes to a person who is, or claims to be, homeless [4].
In 2004, Camden London Borough Council accepted that it owed a duty under the 1996 Act to provide accommodation to Ms Sharif, her father (a man in his 60s with certain health problems) and her sister (aged 14), on the basis that Ms Sharif was homeless.
They were initially accommodated by the Council in a hostel and later moved to a three bedroom house owned by a private sector landlord.
In 2009, the Council asked Ms Shariff, her father and her sister to move to two units on the same floor of a block of flats in North London.
Each unit comprised a single bed sitting room with cooking facilities, plus a bathroom.
The two units were separated by only a few yards.
It was envisaged by the Council that Ms Sharif and her sister would share one unit, and the other unit (suitable only for one person) would be used by her father [8].
Ms Sharif refused the offer, saying that the accommodation was not suitable because her fathers medical condition required them to live in the same unit of accommodation [9].
Ms Sharif requested a review of the Councils decision, but the Councils reviewing officer concluded that the accommodation offered was suitable [9].
Ms Sharif appealed to the London Central County Court on a number of grounds, including the suggestion that the accommodation was not suitable and that section 176 of the 1996 Act precluded the Council from offering Ms Sharif and her family two separate units of accommodation [10].
The County Court dismissed the appeal [11].
There was no further appeal on the issue of the suitability of the accommodation.
However, the Court of Appeal reversed the County Courts decision on the basis that the words together with in section 176 require a homeless family to be housed in the same unit of accommodation [12].
The Council appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court allows the Councils appeal.
It holds that section 176 of the 1996 Act does not preclude local authorities from offering a homeless family two separate units of accommodation.
The lead judgment for the majority is given by Lord Carnwath.
Lord Kerr gives a dissenting judgment.
The majority concludes that, whilst one of the main purposes of the 1996 Act is to ensure that members of a homeless family are not split up by local housing authorities, section 176 does not prevent a local housing authority offering a homeless family two separate units of accommodation if they are so located that they enable the family to live together in practical terms.
That is a factual judgment to be made by the local housing authority [17].
The 1996 Act requires accommodation provided by a local housing authority to be suitable.
However, Ms Sharif no longer denies that the two flats offered to her by the Council meet that requirement [18, 29].
Neither the word accommodation nor the words together with in section 176 imply that a homeless family must be accommodated in the same unit of accommodation [5, 17].
Had the Councils reviewing officer been asked to answer the question of whether section 176 prohibits the Council from housing a homeless family in two separate units of accommodation, it is reasonably clear that he would have answered in the negative.
The main obstacle to family living which had been raised before the reviewing officer had been the problem of caring for Ms Sharifs father in a separate unit of accommodation.
That problem was discounted by the reviewing officer, on the basis that the problem of communication between the two flats would be no greater than in a house with two floors [18].
The arguments made on behalf of Ms Sharif would produce surprising results.
For example, the Council would not be able to improve the position of a homeless family residing in an overcrowded house or flat by offering them an additional neighbouring unit of accommodation, even on a temporary basis [19].
Ms Sharif also accepted that two separate rooms in a hostel or hotel would satisfy the requirements of section 176 of the 1996 Act.
However, the majority found it hard to see why that should be treated differently from the provision of two adjacent flats [20, 30].
Lady Hale emphasises that there is no requirement under the 1996 Act for local housing authorities to provide a communal living space to those who are, or claim to be, homeless [30].
The majority emphasises that their interpretation of section 176 of the 1996 Act does not give local housing authorities a free hand.
It is a fundamental objective of the 1996 Act to ensure that families can live together in a true sense; accommodation provided by a local housing authority will not satisfy section 176 unless it enables that objective to be achieved [23].
Lord Hope says that the test is not to be exploited by local housing authorities; it must be applied reasonably and proportionately [28].
Lord Kerr, dissenting, says that section 176 requires a local housing authority to accommodate a homeless family in the same unit of accommodation.
The accommodation must be of a character that will allow all members of the family to live within it [34].
Lord Kerr concludes that the words together with in section 176 imply joint occupation of the same unit of accommodation [32, 33].
He takes the view that sufficient proximity is very different from living together [35].
"
uksc-2014-0110,"This appeal concerns the interpretation of sections 103 and 106 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA) which imposed a charge to corporation tax on post cessation receipts from a trade, profession or vocation.
The provisions were later rewritten in the Corporation Tax Act 2009.
The receipts in question came about as follows.
Over many years companies within the Littlewoods corporate group paid the Commissioners for Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) substantial sums as value added tax (VAT) on an incorrect understanding of the law.
HMRC later repaid the sums, which had been incorrectly paid, to a nominated member of the corporate group together with interest on those sums as required by sections 78 and 80 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (VATA 1994).
At earlier stages in the proceedings, the dispute concerned HMRCs claim to tax several companies within the group on both repayments and also interest on those repayments, which in aggregate amounted to over 630m.
Now the only question is whether a repayment of overpaid VAT of 124,963,600 is liable to corporation tax in the hands of the appellant, Shop Direct Group (SDG).
SDG challenges the judgment of the Court of Appeal, upholding the determinations of the First tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal, that it is liable to corporation tax on the receipt of that sum.
The prior law
In order to understand the purpose of sections 103 and 106 of ICTA it is necessary to look at the prior law.
In short, until Parliament intervened by enacting sections 32 34 of the Finance Act 1960, sums which a taxpayer received as income from his trade, profession or vocation after he had ceased to trade or carry on his profession or vocation escaped taxation.
Case law established that the sums did not change their character after the discontinuance; their source was unchanged.
The courts treated those sums as the fruit of the trade or profession or as its fruit or aftermath.
The sums were held not to be taxable under Cases I or II of Schedule D because the trade, profession or vocation was not being carried on in the tax year in which the sums were received.
As a result, an astute taxpayer might choose to retire so that he received such income post cessation and thus tax free.
Similarly, as the case law shows, if the taxpayer were unfortunate and died before he had received income arising from his trade, profession or vocation, the receipts were not taxed as income in the hands of his personal representatives, heirs or assignees.
In 1930 Rowlatt J set out the basic principle in Bennett v Ogston (1930) 15 TC 374, in a passage which the House of Lords approved in the later cases to which I refer below.
He said (at p 378): When a trader or a follower of a profession or vocation dies or goes out of business and there remain to be collected sums owing for goods supplied during the existence of the business or for services rendered by the professional man during the course of his life or his business, there is no question of assessing those receipts to income tax; they are the receipts of the business while it lasted, they are arrears of that business, they represent money which was earned during the life of the business and are taken to be covered by the assessment made during the life of the business, whether that assessment was made on the basis of bookings or on the basis of receipts.
Thus in Brown v National Provident Institution [1921] AC 222 the tax paying companies escaped tax on profits derived from transactions conducted in the preceding year because they did not carry on the trade in the tax year in which they received the profit generating sums.
In Stainers Executors v Purchase [1952] AC 280, 23 TC 367, after the actor and film producer, Leslie Howard had been killed by enemy action in 1943, his executors received income from films, which he had produced or in which he had acted.
The Crown argued that the sums had assumed a different character after his death and could no longer be treated as profits and gains of his profession.
The House of Lords rejected this argument and held that the source of the payments was Mr Howards professional activity.
Lord Simonds stated (at p 289) that they retained the essential quality of being the fruit of his professional activity and Lord Asquith of Bishopstone (at p 290) described the payments as the fruit or aftermath of the professional activities of Mr Leslie Howard during his lifetime.
The House of Lords confirmed this approach in relation to royalties received after the death of an author in Carson v Cheyneys Executor [1959] AC 412.
Tax legislation thus left the door wide open to tax avoidance so long as the taxpayer could, by choosing when to discontinue a business, escape tax on post cessation receipts.
The statutory provisions
Parliament sought to close that door by enacting the predecessors of the provisions which are the subject of this appeal, initially in sections 32 34 of the Finance Act 1960, and imposed a charge to tax on post cessation receipts primarily under Case VI of Schedule D. Later, sections 103 to 110 of ICTA became the relevant provisions for both income tax and corporation tax.
Since the statutory provisions relating to income tax were separated from those relating to corporation tax in 2005, the ICTA provisions were amended to relate only to corporation tax.
Section 103 of ICTA, as it was worded in 2007 2008 at the time of the relevant transaction, stated so far as relevant: (1) Where any trade, profession or vocation carried on wholly or partly in the United Kingdom the profits of which are chargeable to tax has been permanently discontinued, corporation tax shall be charged under Case VI of Schedule D in respect of any sums to which this section applies which are received after the discontinuance. (2) Subject to subsection (3) below, this section applies to the following sums arising from the carrying on of the trade, profession or vocation during any period before the discontinuance (not being sums otherwise chargeable to tax) (a) where the profits for that period were computed by reference to earnings, all such sums in so far as their value was not brought into account in computing the profits for any period before the discontinuance, and (b) where the profits were computed on a conventional basis (that is to say, were computed otherwise than by reference to earnings) any sums which if those profits had been computed by reference to earnings, would not have been brought into the computation for any period before the discontinuance because the date on which they became due, or the date on which the amount due in respect thereof was ascertained, fell after the discontinuance. (emphasis added) In this case sub section (2)(a) is relevant as the trading companies computed their profits by reference to earnings.
The only other provision which it is necessary to set out is section 106 of ICTA (as amended by section 882 of, and paragraph 85 of Schedule 1 to, the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005) which governs the charge to tax in some, but not all, of the circumstances in which the rights to receive payments which are post cessation receipts are transferred.
Section 106(1) addresses the circumstance of a transfer for value and provides: Subject to subsection (2) below, in the case of a transfer for value of the right to receive any sum to which section 103, 104(1) or 104(4) applies, any corporation tax chargeable by virtue of either of those sections shall be charged in respect of the amount or value of the consideration (or, in the case of a transfer otherwise than at arms length, in respect of the value of the right transferred as between parties at arms length), and references in this Chapter to sums received shall be construed accordingly.
The subsection quantifies the charge to tax on the transferor of the right.
Thus, for example, if a company, which was entitled to receive royalties from films or books, permanently discontinued its business and assigned the right to receive those royalties to a third party at full market value, the assigning company would be liable to corporation tax under section 103 on its profits calculated by reference to the value it received as consideration for the assignment.
Subsection (2) of section 106 addresses the circumstance where, under sections 110(2)(a) and 337 of ICTA, there is a deemed discontinuance of a trade caused by a change in the persons carrying on the business.
It provides: Where a trade, profession or vocation is treated as permanently discontinued by reason of a change in the persons carrying it on, and the right to receive any sum to which section 103 or 104(1) applies is or was transferred at the time of the change to the company carrying on the trade, profession or vocation after the change, corporation tax shall not be charged by virtue of either of those sections, but any sum received by that company by virtue of the transfer shall be treated for corporation tax purposes as a receipt to be brought into the computation of the profits of the trade, profession or vocation in the period in which it is received.
So, if the transferee, while it is carrying on its trade, receives sums which are post cessation receipts of the former trade, section 103 does not apply to the transferees receipt.
Instead, the subsection treats those receipts by the successor company as part of its trade, brings them into the computation of its profits in the period in which they are received and subjects them to a charge under Case I of Schedule D.
The effect of subsection (2) can be seen in relation to income tax on a partnership, before it was re worded to apply only to corporation tax.
It superseded the decision of the House of Lords in Crompton v Reynolds 33 TC 288, [1952] 1 All ER 888.
In simplified form the facts of that case were as follows.
A partnership of cotton brokers as originally constituted had as an asset of their business a debt owed by a customer incurred in the course of their trade.
A change in the membership of the partnership gave rise to a technical dissolution of the old partnership and the new partnership acquired the assets and liabilities of the old partnership.
The new partnership subsequently collected the debt and escaped income tax on it because the House of Lords held that the collection of the debt was not part of the new partnerships trading operation and thus was not assessable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. Section 106(2) closed the loophole by treating such collection of a prior partnerships debt as a trading receipt of the new partnership.
The factual background
As I have said, the case now concerns only one repayment of 124,963,600 of overpaid VAT which HMRC made in the tax year 2007 2008.
It was referred to as VAT Repayment 2 or VRP2 in the decision of the First tier Tribunal and the judgments of the Upper Tribunal (Asplin J) and of the Court of Appeal and I will use the same term to describe it.
The overpayments arose because VAT was wrongly calculated when goods were sold to agents of the supplier with a discount for commission.
The complex facts are set out in full in the decision of the First tier Tribunal (Judge Roger Berner and Miss Sandi ONeill) [2012] UKFTT 128 (TC)).
I can therefore present them briefly.
The relevant supplies were made by companies in the group of companies between 1978 and 1996.
In presenting the appeal counsel grouped the relevant supplies and the repayments relating to those supplies (which were components of VRP2) as follows.
The supplies were made by: (i) SDG (then named John Noble Ltd) between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 1987 (VRP2A(i)); (ii) Reality Group Ltd (RGL) between 1 April and 30 September 1996 (VRP2A(ii)); (iii) Kay & Co Ltd (Kay & Co) between 1 January 1978 and 30 September 1996 and Abound Ltd (Abound) between 1 April 1978 and 30 September 1996 (VRP2B); and (iv) GUS plc or RGL between 1 January 1978 and 31 March 1996 (VRP2C).
The VAT had been paid in relation to those supplies by the representative member of the group of companies under section 43 of VATA 1994, which until 11 February 1992 was GUS Merchandise Corporation Ltd and between then and 6 August 1997 was Kay & Co Ltd. By the time VRP2 was paid in 2007, each of the companies which had made the relevant supplies had permanently discontinued its trade.
It is not necessary to set out the complex facts of the reorganisations of businesses within the group of companies in any detail.
The relevant transfers may be summarised as follows: (i) the trade of SDG was transferred to RGL on 1 June 1991; (ii) the trade of GUS plc was transferred to RGL on 1 April 1996 but the transferors right to receive a VAT repayment, which became VRP2C, was retained; (iii) the trades of Kay & Co and Abound were transferred to RGL on 1 April 1997 but the transferors rights to VAT repayments, which became VRP2B, were retained; (iv) the trade of RGL was transferred to SDG on 25 November 2000; and (v) finally, after March UK Ltd (March) had acquired from GUS plc various companies, including SDG, RGL, Kay & Co and Abound, on 27 May 2003, the trade of SDG was transferred to Shop Direct Home Shopping Ltd (SDHSL) on 28 October 2005.
No documentation vouching the transfers in (i) and (iv) above was available to the First tier Tribunal but the tribunal inferred and found as fact that in each case the whole of the trade was transferred, including the transferors right to VAT repayments.
On 24 June 2003 GUS plc, which had become the representative member of the VAT group on 20 May in that year, made a claim for repayment of VAT under section 80 of VATA 1994 from HMRC.
The claim included the various payments which led to the repayment which has been described as VRP2.
The person entitled to receive the repayments under section 80 of VATA 1994 was the representative member of the VAT group.
But the First tier Tribunal held that the benefit of the repayment was accepted as belonging to the appropriate companies acquired by March.
The tribunal did not have evidence of how the GUS group operated its treasury function but inferred that the trading companies had had to account to the representative member to fund the VAT due on their trading and that the representative member had to account to them for any repayments of VAT.
Argos Ltd (Argos) became the representative member of the VAT group on 9 October 2006.
Because, by the time HMRC paid VRP2 in September 2007, Argos had been transferred to another group of companies under Home Retail Group plc (HRG), it was necessary for the interested parties to enter into agreements to determine which entity within the corporate group which was not being sold should receive the repayments from Argos, which was acting as the groups representative member.
March, GUS plc and HRG agreed that the solicitors, Weil, Gotshal & Manges (WGM), be appointed agents of Argos and this was done.
WGM were also appointed the agent of SDG to receive VRP2 as part of the administrative arrangements for the receipt of this payment from HMRC.
Argos gave an irrevocable instruction to HMRC to pay all VAT repayments to WGM.
To secure its position, HMRC obtained (a) an undertaking from SDG that it would repay VRP2 and the statutory interest thereon in specified circumstances and (b) releases from Kay & Co, RGL and Abound in relation to their entitlement (if any) to receive any repayment when the GUS home shopping business was sold to March in May 2003.
On Marchs direction, WGM paid an amount equal to VRP2 to a Jersey registered company, L W Corporation Ltd (LWC), which March had made SDGs parent company on 25 October 2006.
SDG, which had been dormant since October 2005, had become an unlimited company on 30 January 2007 and so did not have to file its accounts in Companies House but only with HMRC.
This enabled it to avoid publicity regarding the receipt of VRP2 and the interest thereon.
Amounts equal to the sums paid to LWC were recognised as an exceptional item in the profit and loss account of SDG and as an inter company receivable due from LWC on SDGs balance sheet.
SDG thus received VRP2.
Consistently with this presentation in SDGs accounts, the First tier Tribunal held that SDG received VRP2 as beneficial owner at the time of receipt.
The tribunal interpreted Marchs agreed arrangements with GUS plc and HRG as an acknowledgement that SDG was entitled to VRP2.
There was no suggestion in the findings of fact that any other company ever questioned SDGs right to receive VRP2.
In my view the inference that SDG was beneficially entitled to VRP2 was obvious.
The proceedings below
After HMRC amended the corporation tax self assessments of the companies, including SDG, which received the various VAT repayments, the recipient companies appealed those assessments.
The First tier Tribunal in a decision dated 14 February 2012 dismissed each of the appeals.
On 19 April 2013 Asplin J sitting as a judge of the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber) dismissed the appeal.
SDG alone appealed to the Court of Appeal in respect of its assessment to corporation tax on VRP 2 and the related statutory interest.
In a judgment dated 11 March 2014, which Briggs LJ wrote and with which Rimer LJ and Sir Stanley Burnton agreed, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal: [2014] EWCA Civ 255; [2014] STC 1383.
SDG applied for permission to appeal to this court and was permitted to appeal in relation to VRP2 only.
The issues now in dispute
Mr David Goldberg QC for SDG submitted that the maximum sum (if any) on which SDG should be charged corporation tax was the sum of about 200,000 which related to the supplies that SDG itself had made in 1986 and 1987 and which was VRP2A(i) in para 10 above.
He advanced three reasons in support of this contention.
First, he submitted that section 103 of ICTA imposed a tax charge only on the original trader (ie the person from whose pre discontinuation trading the sum arises).
As SDG did not carry on the trades which produced the bulk of VRP2, it was not liable to corporation tax on VRP2 except, possibly, for VRP2A(i).
Secondly, if the receipt of a sum equivalent to VRP2 arose from an intra group transfer to SDG without any assignment of rights to it, section 103 did not impose a charge.
Thirdly and alternatively, if the receipt of that sum were the result of a transfer to SDG of the right to the receipt, section 103 did not impose a charge and, in any event, section 106 precluded any charge to tax on SDG.
Mr Malcolm Gammie QC for HMRC challenged this analysis on every count.
He submitted (a) that it was illegitimate to read into section 103 any restriction that confined the charge to the original trader, (b) that section 106(1) applied only to transfers for value (which did not occur in this case) and (c) that section 106(2) did not apply unless the company to whom a trade was transferred received the transferors post cessation profits while it, the transferee, was trading (which also did not occur in this case).
He pointed out that SDG and the other group companies had led no evidence of the intra company transactions and had been content to rely on an agreed statement of facts.
It was not open to SDG to seek to undermine the First tier Tribunals findings of fact by inviting the court to make contrary inferences as to the nature of the intra group transactions.
Analysis
Section 6 of ICTA provided that corporation tax shall be charged on profits of companies.
Section 8 of that Act provided that a company shall be chargeable to that tax on all its profits wherever arising, and section 9 provided that the amount of any income shall for purposes of corporation tax be computed in accordance with income tax principles, all questions as to the amounts which are or are not to be charged to tax as a persons income being determined in accordance with income tax law and practice.
Section 18 of ICTA set out Schedule D which imposed a charge to tax on the annual profits or gains arising or accruing to any person residing in the United Kingdom from any trade, profession or vocation.
Section 18(3) set out the Cases of Schedule D. Case I charged tax in respect of any trade carried on in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.
Case VI, which section 103 brings into play, provided for tax in respect of any annual profits or gains not falling under any other Case of Schedule D .
Finally, section 18(4) of ICTA provided: The provisions of Schedule D and of subsection (2) above are without prejudice to any other provision of the Tax Acts directing tax to be charged under Schedule D or under one or other of the Cases set out in subsection (3) above, and tax directed to be so charged shall be charged accordingly.
Section 103 was one such provision.
Against this background the first question is whether section 103, which I have set out in para 6 above, contains an implicit restriction so that the charge to tax on post cessation receipts falls only on the former trader, whose trade was the source of the income, as Mr Goldberg submitted.
In my view the answer to that question is no, for the following three principal reasons.
First, there is nothing in the words of section 103(1) or (2) which necessitates such implication.
The charge to tax is clear: where a trade has been permanently discontinued, corporation tax shall be charged under Case VI on sums arising from the carrying on of the trade during any period before the discontinuance.
Section 103(1) required only that the sums are received after the discontinuance.
The section specified the source of the sums which fell within the charge but imposed no further restriction on the charge.
In particular, it imposed no limit on who was the recipient of the sums and thus liable to the charge.
Secondly, the mischief which section 103 addressed is clear.
Its predecessor, section 32(2) of the Finance Act 1960, contained the same phrase, sums arising from the carrying on of the trade .
The phrase referred in my view to the sums which the prior case law called the fruit of the trade.
Section 32 of the 1960 Act addressed the circumstance, which I have discussed in paras 3 and 4 above, of sums from an otherwise taxable source escaping tax as a result of the permanent discontinuance of a trade.
Like Briggs LJ (at para 29 of his judgment) I interpret the provision and its statutory successors as bringing into the Schedule D Case VI charge to tax the fruit of the discontinued trade not only in the hands of the former trader, his personal representatives and heirs but also in the hands of those to whom the rights to the post cessation receipts have been assigned or who are otherwise entitled to receive and keep the sums.
The mischief was the loophole created by the need for a continuing source in the year of receipt.
The purpose of section 103 was to make sure that sums which a person received, which arose from a discontinued trade and which were not otherwise taxed, were brought into a charge to tax.
The statutory innovation was to impose the Case VI charge, absent that continuing source, on the recipient of the sums.
No sound reason of policy has been suggested for confining the charge to the former trader and his personal representatives.
Thirdly, neighbouring provisions in ICTA drew a distinction between the person chargeable to tax and the person who had previously carried on the trade, giving rise to the inference that the former person was not confined to the latter.
Thus section 105, which provided for allowable deductions in the calculation of the section 103 charge, referred in subsection (1) in its pre 2005 form to computing the tax charge under section 103 in respect of sums received by any person and in its later form to sums received by any company.
It listed as the allowable deductions both losses and expenses which the former trader (the person by whom [the trade] was carried on) would have deducted if the trade had not been discontinued and also capital allowances to which the former trader (the person who carried on the trade) was entitled before the discontinuance.
Had Parliament intended that the section 103 charge should fall only on the former trader, there would have been no need to distinguish between any person on the one hand and the former trader on the other.
Section 105(4) before 2005 also used the phrase any person in relation to an analogous charge to tax after a change of basis under section 104.
Section 108 as initially enacted allowed the person by whom the trade had been carried on to elect to carry back the charge so that the sum in question was treated as if it had been received on the date of the discontinuance.
The way the opening of the section was worded is illuminating.
It provided the election was available: Where any sum is (a) chargeable to tax by virtue of section 103 or 104, and (b) received in any year of assessment beginning not later than six years after the discontinuance or, as the case may be, change of basis by the person by whom the trade, profession or vocation was carried on before the discontinuance or change, or by his personal representatives In my view again this wording suggests that there is a general charge to tax under section 103 and that the former trader (or his personal representative) is not the only recipient who falls within that charge.
Parliament had no reason to spell out in (b) that the sum had to be received by the former trader or his representatives if that was inherent in section 103.
Mr Goldberg also submitted that SDGs receipt of a sum equal to VRP2 did not have a former trade as its source but was the result of an intra group arrangement which was either a transfer for no consideration of that sum or a transfer for no consideration of the rights to VRP2.
He posed the question, what is the receipt from? and submitted that the correct answer was the transfer of either the sum or the right.
He referred to Hochstrasser v Mayes [1960] AC 376 and Abbott v Philbin [1961] AC 352 in support of the contention that regard must be had to the most proximate cause of the receipt.
I do not accept this submission.
In my view those cases have no bearing.
They concern the charge to tax under Schedule E on the remuneration of an employee.
I accept Mr Gammies submission that in the context of Schedule E the relevant statutory question focused on the character of the receipt in the employees hands.
Rule 1 of the Schedule spoke of a charge on a person having or exercising an office or employment in respect of salaries perquisites or profits whatsoever therefrom (emphasis added).
The question was whether the employee has received money or moneys worth representing remuneration for his services.
By contrast, under section 103 the focus was on the original source of the receipt.
The decisions and arrangements within the VAT group of companies about the specific company which was to receive the repayment did not alter the original source of the receipt.
The question was whether the sum received arose from the discontinued trade before its discontinuance.
Section 106(1), which I have set out in para 7 above, also supports a wide interpretation of the scope of the section 103 charge.
Contrary to Mr Goldbergs submission, I cannot read the subsection as covering all transfers whether for value or for no consideration (other than the transfer of the right to receive the post cessation payments when there is a deemed discontinuance of the trade under subsection (2)).
The opening words of subsection (1) show that the subsection relates to transfers for value.
Where the transfer is at arms length, the transferor is charged under section 103 by reference to the stipulated consideration.
The words in parenthesis substitute market value where the transfer is not at arms length.
It is true that it may appear anomalous that the subsection governs a transfer for a nominal value, say 50 pence, in a transaction otherwise than at arms length but not a transfer for no consideration.
But that is what the section says.
Further, the anomaly is more apparent than real if, as I consider, section 103 imposes a charge on the gratuitous transferee.
Thus, for example, section 103 when it extended to the individual taxpayer would have applied to an author who on his retirement assigned for value the future royalties arising from his work.
Having chosen to capitalise his future income flow, he would be taxed at the market value of that income flow as at the date of transfer rather than on his future receipts as and when received.
But where, on his retirement, he assigned the future royalties to his spouse or friend for no consideration, section 103 would tax the receipts when they are received by the transferee.
That to my mind is a rational regime.
Section 106(2), which I have set out in para 8 above, deals with the circumstance that a trade is treated as having been discontinued by reason of a change of the persons carrying it on and at the same time the right to receive the post cessation receipts is transferred to the company that carries on the trade thereafter.
The rule is set out in the phrase: corporation tax shall not be charged by virtue of either [section 103 or 104], but any sum received by that company by virtue of the transfer shall be treated for corporation tax purposes as a receipt to be brought into the computation of the profits of the trade in the period in which it is received.
I construe the words after the conjunction but as the trigger for disapplying sections 103 and 104.
Like Briggs LJ, I adopt a purposive analysis.
I do not accept that Parliament intended to create a large class of post cessation receipts which the transferee could release from a charge to tax by the simple expedient of discontinuing its trade or by creating a deemed discontinuation by transferring its trade to another person while reserving to itself the right to receive those receipts.
That was the mischief which led to the enactment of sections 32 to 34 of the Finance Act 1960 in the first place.
In my view this subsection takes effect only if the transferee receives those sums while it is trading.
If it does, the transferee is taxed under Case I of Schedule D.
If it does not receive the sums or if it receives them after it has ceased trading, section 103 applies to impose a charge on the recipient.
In summary, (i) the basic rule in section 103 is that sums arising from the carrying on of the trade before discontinuance are, if received after discontinuance, charged to tax under Case VI of Schedule D; (ii) there is no restriction in section 103 itself on who the recipient of those fruits of the trade may be; (iii) section 106(1) quantifies the section 103 charge at the amount of the consideration or the market value of the rights to such sums when the former trader transfers its rights to those future receipts for value and the subsection imposes the charge on the former trader; and (iv) section 106(2) disapplies section 103 and substitutes Case I of Schedule D only if the transferee company is carrying on the continuing business when it receives the fruits of the trade, which is deemed to have been discontinued.
It is necessary now to apply that analysis to the facts as found by the First tier Tribunal.
Before so doing, I record that SDG did not argue before the First tier Tribunal that section 106(1) had the effect of imposing a charge to tax on an entity other than SDG.
The Court of Appeal refused to allow SDG to run such an argument.
I also am satisfied that it would not be fair to allow the argument to be advanced at this late stage.
It involves SDG inviting the court to make inferences from findings of fact which were not directed to the argument it now wishes to advance.
SDG did not lead any evidence about the various intra group transfers.
It may be that SDG did not have the necessary evidence to explain how it was arranged that it should receive VRP2.
But SDG had the burden of overturning the challenged assessment and did not lead evidence to achieve that.
The court must therefore apply the law to the facts as found by the First tier Tribunal.
In any event, SDGs principal case before this court was that there must have been an intra group transfer or transfers of the component parts of VRP2 the sum of money to it for no consideration and that there was no transfer to it of the rights to repayment which made up VRP2.
If that is what occurred, or if there had been a transfer of the rights for no consideration, it would not assist SDGs appeal as section 106(1) would not apply to impose a charge on the transferor or transferors in the absence of a sale.
Turning to the First tier Tribunals findings of fact, it is clear from the summary in para 11(ii) above that on the transfer of the trade of GUS plc in 1996, the entitlement to a VAT repayment arising from the discontinued trade, which became VRP2C, was not transferred.
Similarly, Kay & Co and Abound retained their equivalent entitlements when their trades were transferred to RGL in 1997 (para 11(iii) above).
Those entitlements became VRP2B. There is no explanation as to how those entitlements resulted in VRP2C and VRP2B being paid to SDG.
There is no suggestion that either the transfer of the trade of SDG to RGL (para 11(i) above) or the later transfer of RGLs trade to SDG (para 11(iv) above), both of which may have relevance to the two components of VRP2A, was for value.
Accordingly, section 106(1) is of no relevance to these transactions and no tax falls to be charged on the various transferors.
Further, there was no evidence and no findings that any of the intra group transfers which may have occurred in order to transfer the right to receive VRP2 to SDG involved transfers for value.
Again, section 106(1) has no application.
Section 106(2) also is of no relevance.
While the trade of SDG was transferred to SDHSL in 2005 (para 11(v) above), none of the repayments of VAT were made to SDHSL.
That is the end of the matter.
It is therefore not necessary to address Mr Goldbergs challenge to the finding by the First tier Tribunal that the transfer of SDGs trade to SDHSL did not include the entitlement to the VAT repayments, which was based on his construction of the transfer agreement between SDG and SDHSL in 2005.
What is clear from the findings (viz paras 13 and 14 above) is that March organised the groups affairs so that VRP2 would be paid by HMRC to SDG via the solicitors, WGM, and that HMRC protected itself against other possible claimants by obtaining releases.
SDG, as the First tier Tribunal found, received VRP2 as its beneficial owner.
It received sums arising from the carrying on of the trade of the companies enumerated in para 11 above during periods before the discontinuance and the sums were not otherwise chargeable to tax.
VRP2 accordingly is subject to a charge to corporation tax in the hands of its recipient, SDG.
Conclusion
Before concluding, I would like to acknowledge the admirable decision of the First tier Tribunal in this case, which involved grappling with many more factual and legal issues than this court has had to address.
I would dismiss the appeal.
","This appeal concerns a repayment of overpaid value added tax (VAT) of approximately 125m (the VAT Repayment) received by the appellant, Shop Direct Group (SDG), a company in the Littlewoods corporate group (the Group).
Over a number of years, companies within the Group made substantial overpayments of VAT to HMRC.
These VAT overpayments were made on an incorrect understanding of law: the VAT was wrongly calculated when goods were sold to agents of the supplier with a discount for commission.
The relevant supplies were made between 1978 and 1996 by companies within the Group, including SDG.
VAT was paid to HMRC in relation to these supplies by the representative member of the Group under section 43 of Value Added Tax Act 1994 (VATA 1994).
By 2007, following a series of reorganisations within the Group, each of the companies which had made relevant supplies had permanently discontinued its trade.
In June 2003, the representative member of the Group made a claim for repayment of VAT from HMRC under section 80 of VATA 1994.
This claim included the various payments which led to the VAT Repayment.
In September 2007, HMRC made the VAT Repayment pursuant to arrangements which resulted in the VAT Repayment being received by SDG as beneficial owner at the time of receipt.
The issue before the Supreme Court is whether the VAT Repayment is liable to corporation tax under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA, later rewritten in the Corporation Tax Act 2009).
Sections 103 and 106 of ICTA imposed a charge to corporation tax on post cessation receipts from a trade, profession or vocation.
These provisions and their statutory predecessors were enacted to prevent tax avoidance by businesses choosing when to discontinue a business in order to escape tax on post cessation receipts [1, 3 9].
In the proceedings below, the First tier Tribunal, Upper Tribunal and Court of Appeal all held that SDG was liable to corporation tax on the receipt of the VAT Repayment.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses SDGs appeal.
Lord Hodge (with whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Reed, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hughes agree) gives the judgment of the court.
Against the background of the other relevant provisions of ICTA [18], the court concludes that section 103 does not contain an implicit restriction so that the charge to tax on post cessation receipts falls
only on the former trader whose trade was the source of the income [19].
There are three reasons in support of this conclusion: First, there is nothing in the wording of section 103(1) or (2) which necessitates such implication.
The charge to tax is clear: where a trade has been permanently discontinued, corporation tax shall be charged on sums arising from the carrying on of the tradeduring any period before the discontinuance.
Section 103(1) required only that the sums are received after the discontinuance; it specified the source of the sums falling within the charge but imposed no further restriction [20].
Secondly, section 103 was designed to catch the fruit of the trade.
Its aim was to make sure that sums which a person received, which arose from a discontinued trade and which were not otherwise taxed, were brought into a charge to tax.
No sound policy reason has been suggested for confining the charge to the former trader and his personal representatives [21].
Thirdly, the neighbouring provisions of section 103 drew a distinction between the person chargeable to tax and the person who had previously carried on the trade.
This suggests that the former was not confined to the latter [22 23].
The court rejects SDGs submission that the sum it received equivalent to the VAT Repayment did not have a former trade as its source, but was the result of an intra group arrangement which was either a transfer for no consideration of that sum, or a transfer for no consideration of the rights to the VAT Repayment.
Under section 103 of ICTA, the focus was on the original source of the receipt; the arrangements within the Group as to the specific company that was to receive the VAT Repayment did not alter that original source [24].
Section 106 of ICTA also supports a wider interpretation of the scope of the section 103 charge to corporation tax: section 106(1) quantifies the section 103 charge at the amount of the consideration or the market value of the rights to such sums when the former trader transfers its rights to those future receipts for value and the subsection imposes the charge on the former trader [25]; and section 106(2) disapplies section 103 and substitutes another Case of Schedule D only if the transferee company is carrying on the continuing business when it receives the fruits of the trade which is deemed to have been discontinued [26].
Applying this analysis of sections 103 and 106 of ICTA to the facts of this case, the court concludes that the Groups affairs were organised such that the VAT Repayment was received by SDG as beneficial owner, receiving sums arising from the carrying on of the trade of the companies making relevant supplies during periods before the discontinuance and the sums were not otherwise chargeable to tax.
The VAT Repayment accordingly is subject to a charge to corporation tax in the hands of SDG [28 31].
"
uksc-2014-0159,"The council appeals against the decision that it is liable to pay compensation under section 106 of the Building Act 1984, for loss to a business on Hastings Pier arising from its closure during 2006 under the councils emergency powers.
The respondent (Manolete) pursued the claim as assignee of Stylus Sports Ltd (Stylus), which owned and operated the business at the relevant time, but went into liquidation in late 2011.
The only issue in the appeal is whether Stylus was itself in default within the meaning of that section, so precluding it from making a claim.
The statutory provisions
As explained more fully by Jackson LJ in the Court of Appeal ([2014] 1 WLR 4030, [2014] EWCA Civ 562, 46 paras 46ff), the 1984 Act is one of a sequence of public health statutes, going back to the 19th century, which among other matters have dealt with the regulation of new buildings and the control of dangerous structures.
The 1984 Act draws together a number of such provisions, including building regulations (Part I), supervision of construction work other than by local authorities (Part II), and Other provisions about buildings (Part III).
Within Part III, and relevant to this case, are section 77 (Dangerous building) and 78 (Dangerous building emergency measures).
Section 77 enables the council to apply to the magistrates court in relation to a building or structure which is in such a condition, or is used to carry such loads, as to be dangerous.
Under subsection (1), the court may either (a) where danger arises from the condition of the building or structure, order the owner to execute work necessary to obviate the danger or to demolish it, or (b) where danger arises from overloading of the building or structure, make an order restricting its use until a magistrates court, being satisfied that any necessary works have been executed, withdraws or modifies the restriction.
By section 77(2)(b) if the person against whom an order is made under subsection (1)(a) above fails to comply with the order within the time specified, the local authority may execute the order and (b) recover the expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so from the person in default.
Under section 78 (directly relevant to this case), where it appears to the authority that a building or structure or part of it is in such a state, or is used to carry such loads, as to be dangerous, and that immediate action should be taken to remove the danger, they may take such steps as may be necessary for that purpose, having given notice if reasonably practicable to the owner and occupiers.
Compensation is governed by section 106 (in Part IV of the Act): (1) A local authority shall make full compensation to a person who has sustained damage by reason of the exercise by the authority, in relation to a matter as to which he has not himself been in default, of any of their powers under this Act. (emphasis added) By section 106(2) any dispute arising as to the fact of damage, or as to the amount of compensation is to be determined by arbitration.
section 106 must be read with section 78(7): In the context of a claim resulting from emergency action under section 78, (7) Where in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by this section the owner or occupier of any premises sustains damage, but section 106(1) below does not apply because the owner or occupier has been in default (a) the owner or occupier may apply to a magistrates court to determine whether the local authority were justified in exercising their powers under this section so as to occasion the damage sustained, and (b) if the court determines that the local authority were not so justified, the owner or occupier is entitled to compensation, and section 106(2) and (3) below applies in relation to any dispute as regards compensation arising under this subsection.
The default on which the council relies includes alleged breaches (actual or prospective) of the duties imposed by the Occupiers Liability Act 1957 and the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.
In short the former (by section 2) imposes on occupiers of premises the common duty of care; that is a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there.
The latter, by section 2, imposes on an employer the duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees, and in particular to maintain any place of work (including means of access and egress) in a condition that is safe and without risks to their health.
The facts
The history of the pier structure is described in the report by engineers for the council (the Gifford report) in June 2006, which led directly to their decision to close the pier: The original Hastings Pier was opened in 1872.
It was built to a length of 277m with its timber deck bearing on wrought iron lattice trusses, all supported on three rows of cast iron screw piles via cast iron columns; the columns were braced with wrought iron ties secured with cast iron clamps.
The width varied from 13.6m at the Central Section to 60m at Head and 39.6m at the landward end.
Repairs utilising steel trusses and steel columns have been undertaken at various times since following a fire in 1917 to the Pier Head, partial demolition (sectioning) and actual bomb damage during the 1939 45 war, and widening to both sides of the Pier They commented on the general state of the pier: Experience has shown the typical life of Victorian piers to be approximately 100 years; during this time continual maintenance would have been required, including the replacement [of] some critical elements.
After this time, major reconstruction works would be required if continued use of the pier were to be viable.
The general condition of Hastings Pier fits this pattern.
In recent years the freehold of the pier was owned by Ravenclaw Investments Incorporated (Ravenclaw), a company registered in Panama, and managed on their behalf by Boss Management UK Ltd (Boss).
Stylus occupied two units, C2 and C15, close to the entrance to the pier at the northern (town) end.
They operated a bingo hall in unit C2 and an amusement arcade in unit C15.
The units were held respectively under leases from Ravenclaw dated 14 August 2001 and 10 October 2001.
The premises as so leased were confined generally to the internal non structural walls, and internal surfaces, and specifically excluded any main structural parts of the premises or of the building (Schedule 1).
Ravenclaw as landlord was responsible for repair and when necessary renewal of the structure including the support structure of the pier.
In 2004 Stylus became concerned about the structural integrity of the pier.
They commissioned a full structural engineering survey of the pier by Hamill Davies Limited.
The report (the HDL report), produced in September 2004, was provided both to Ravenclaw and in January 2005 to the council.
It advised that urgent work was required to repair piles at the far end of the pier (some distance beyond the Stylus units).
This should be done ideally within the next two months to avoid the worst of the winter weather; and the deck area supported by these piles should be closed to the public until this work is completed.
They also advised that future work should be carried out to the structure of the pier in the area of the Stylus units.
Of this they said: With regard to the remaining work it is understood that this cannot be undertaken immediately.
However this work should be completed within one year, with regular monitoring of the defective areas until this can be achieved.
Unless this is carried out we judge there to be an unacceptable risk to the public.
There is no evidence of action by Ravenclaw or the council to remedy the structural defects in response to this report, other than some limited work by Ravenclaw in the winter of 2005 2006.
Meanwhile the public continued to use the pier, and the pier facilities (including the bingo hall and the amusement arcade) remained open for business.
In early April 2006 a council officer inspected the underside of the pier, when a section of tension cord fell from the pier.
The council commissioned Gifford to report on the structural stability of the pier.
Their brief included appraisal of its structural integrity and any potential risks to the public.
The areas chosen were those that would be subjected to the greatest crowd loading in the event of mass evacuation of the buildings, ie the designated escape routes (report para 1.3).
In May 2006 the council tried without success to compel Ravenclaw to commission a full structural assessment of the Pier.
On 15 June 2006 they asked Boss, as agents for Ravenclaw, to close off the pier beyond the front facade, but that request was not complied with.
The Gifford report, received by the council on 16 June 2006, identified serious structural defects, and recommended a full structural survey as a matter of urgency.
It recommended by way of immediate restrictions a) Access resulting in the potential for crowd loading on the Central Section and beyond should be prohibited until either, as a minimum, the presently identified defects in the area of the Central Section bounded by Columns 197 216 211 200 have been rectified or alternative safe access routes have been provided. b) Access by shop tenants or others for the purpose of maintenance need not be restricted. (para 6.1) The columns there identified were beneath the Stylus premises.
On 16 June the Council exercised its emergency powers under section 78 of the 1984 Act to close the pier to the public from the front facade onwards.
A barrier was erected across the frontage with a notice saying danger keep out.
A letter was delivered on the same day to tenants of units on the pier stating that the pier was being closed from the main entrance building onwards, including the Bingo Hall and Amusement arcade.
The letter indicated that the council had had concerns about the pier for some time and had served notice on the owners requiring them to carry out a survey of the structure.
It continued: In recent days the council has become aware that major events were still being booked for the Pier ballroom; two of these have been booked for July and one in August.
As a result of its concerns over the Pier structure the Council commissioned consulting engineers Gifford of Southampton to look at a specific area of concern under the main covered walkway around the main facade entrance.
This inspection was carried out yesterday.
It has been established that at least five trusses have failed in this area.
Our consultant is of the opinion that it is unsafe to allow large numbers of people onto the Pier.
This area provides the only method of access onto and off the Pier.
Any emergency affecting the rest of Pier, including the ballroom, requiring evacuation would mean crowds of people walking over the area where we have been specifically advised that crowds are unsafe.
As a result the council has had no option other than to use its emergency powers to close much of the Pier immediately.
The letter noted that, despite previous attempts to resolve the situation, the Pier management were continuing to plan for large events.
On the same day the council applied to Hastings Magistrates Court under section 77(1)(b) of the 1984 Act.
The initial hearing at the Magistrates Court took place on 21 June 2006.
A representative of Stylus attended and asked to be included in the proceedings.
After adjournments, at the substantive hearing on 12 September the court made an order under that section prohibiting public access to the pier until the necessary remedial works had been carried out.
Meanwhile, in July 2006 Stylus instructed HDL to undertake an inspection of the area beneath its units.
It also instituted proceedings against Ravenclaw to require them to carry out the works of repair under the lease, and obtained summary judgment, but that was not complied with by Ravenclaw.
In May 2007 Stylus began itself to carry out the necessary remedial works under its own premises.
Those having been completed, the magistrates court on 4 July 2007 varied its order so as to permit public access to its premises.
On 8 November 2006 Stylus had notified the council of its intention to claim compensation under section 106(1) of the 1984 Act, for losses allegedly suffered as a result of the closure of the pier between 16 June and 12 September 2006.
In late 2011 Stylus went into liquidation, and in January 2012 the liquidator of Stylus assigned Stylus claim against the Council to Manolete, the present respondents.
The present proceedings in the Technology and Construction Court (begun under CPR Part 8, on the basis that there would be no substantial dispute of fact) sought a declaration that the council were liable to pay compensation: [2013] EWHC 842 (TCC); [2013] 2 EGLR 17.
The proceedings below
Before Ramsey J the council raised a number of defences including the one now in issue, which he summarised: That the Council is not liable under section 106 of the 1984 Act because the claimant was in default for the purposes of that section because of the breach of section 2 of the Occupiers Liability Act 1957 and/or because it took a lease of the Pier past the end of its design life from a company registered outside the jurisdiction and was aware by the very latest in 2004 that there were serious problems with the structure of the Pier but took no adequate steps to ensure the Pier was repaired or the public excluded. (para 14) He noted that in submissions the council had relied also on the duties under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.
He rejected the defence, holding that the reference to default should be read as default in respect of obligations imposed by the 1984 Act itself.
In support he cited authorities under previous statutes using the same expression, in particular Neath Rural District Council v Williams [1951] 1 KB 115.
He added: If that is not so and if it were necessary to see whether a party was in breach of any provision of other statutes, as is submitted here, then the scope of enquiry would be large and would require investigation of further factual matters to determine whether there was a default in terms of those statutes. (para 46) He also rejected a separate defence that, absent section 78, Stylus would have had no action in tort in any event.
That is no longer in issue.
In the Court of Appeal [2014] 1 WLR 4030 Jackson LJ agreed that default was limited to default under the 1984 Act.
He reviewed at length the legislative history, dating from the Metropolitan Buildings Act 1844.
He noted that compensation provisions, substantially in the same form as section 106, had appeared in the Public Health Acts of 1875 and 1936.
He referred to Hobbs v Winchester Corpn [1910] 2 KB 471, which he read as treating the words in default as directed to default under the Act of 1875.
However, he accepted the submission of counsel for the authority that in both the 1875 and 1936 Act it should be read as extending also to related statutes: He points out that in many instances a building owner would be in breach of local Building Acts and Improvement Acts.
If the local authority intervened in order to protect public safety, it would be absurd if the building owner could recover compensation under section 308.
I accept that submission.
In my view the default proviso in the 1875 Act was referring to a default under the 1875 Act or related Acts. (para 52 emphasis added) However, the same extension was not required under the 1984 Act, because There are no local byelaws or parallel statutes directed to the same subject matter as the 1984 Act.
The 1984 Act and the Regulations made under it are comprehensive. (para 76) A narrow construction was supported also by looking at the statute as a whole: Where the same phrase occurs more than once it should generally be construed in the same way on each occasion The phrase in default occurs in three significant places in the 1984 Act, namely in section 77(2)(b), section 78(7) and section 106(1).
In both sections 77(2)(b) and sections 78(7) default has a narrow meaning.
It clearly refers to a failure to perform obligations under the 1984 Act.
This circumstance is a pointer towards construing default in section 106 narrowly, namely as meaning breach of an obligation under the 1984 Act. (paras 74 75) In agreement with the judge he concluded: The phrase in default in section 106 of the 1984 Act means in breach of an obligation arising under the 1984 Act.
The provision does not require the court or the arbitrator to conduct a wide ranging review of other legislation and the common law in order to see whether the claimant is in breach of any duties arising outside the 1984 Act. (para 79)
The court had some sympathy for the argument that the council should not be obliged to compensate Stylus for being prevented from admitting the public to dangerous premises.
But, given that the true culprit Ravenclaw was beyond the reach of enforcement procedures, the court was faced with the familiar problem of deciding which of the surviving parties should bear the loss, the answer to which depended on the statutory scheme.
He added: [Stylus] has acted responsibly at all stages.
It did its utmost to compel the landlord to carry out remedial works.
Ultimately it stepped into the breach and did the works itself.
If the local authority had wished to avoid liability to pay compensation under section 106, it could have brought proceedings under section 77 of the 1984 Act sooner and thereby avoided the need to take emergency action under section 78.
Finally, on this point, [the councils] general arguments will still be available at the quantum hearing before the arbitrator.
The local authority will be entitled to argue that even if it had not fenced off the pier, [Stylus] could have made little use of its two units. (paras 81 82)
Finally he considered and rejected a separate argument on behalf of the council that the claim was precluded by the ex turpi causa principle, on the basis that to admit the public would have been contrary to its statutory responsibilities: the motivation for the local authoritys closure of the pier to the public on 16 June 2006 was the likelihood of large crowds accessing the pier on and after 17 June for reasons unconnected with [Stylus] business.
As at 16 June 2006 [Stylus] had not incurred liability to any member of the public for breach of the Occupiers Liability Act 1957.
Nor can I see any basis for saying that [Stylus] had committed any breach of the statutory duties which it owed to its employees under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 . (paras 91 92) In his view, the default proviso was the control mechanism which eliminates claims that are unacceptable on grounds of public policy.
It left no room for the application of the ex turpi causa rule (para 94).
He added: 95.
Having said that, I do accept that the structural condition of the pier will be relevant to the quantum of the claim.
The local authority will be entitled to argue in the arbitration due to be held under section 106(2) that the loss of profit caused by the local authoritys conduct must be substantially reduced by reason of the structural condition of the pier.
Indeed the local authority would be entitled to argue that the quantum is reduced to nil, although on the evidence which I have seen that outcome seems unlikely.
The submissions in summary
In this court Mr Gasztowicz QC for the council submits that the courts were wrong to treat the word default as confined to default under the 1984 Act.
That is supported both by ordinary meaning of the word and by the legislative history.
The authorities referred to by the judge and the Court of Appeal do not lead to a different conclusion.
Stylus was in default in the relevant sense because it was in breach of its obligations under the 1957 Act and 1974 Acts in relation to the very matter in relation to which the statutory power was exercised, namely the admission of the public to premises which when they were admitted were dangerous (to them and employees) (printed case p 30)
He relies in particular on Stylus own evidence which showed that: i) It had received the September 2004 HDL report showing that urgent repairs were necessary to protect the public, including work in the Stylus area of the pier, which if not carried out within at most a year from September 2004 would mean there would be an unacceptable risk to the public; ii) No further report had been obtained giving a different assessment on the state of the Pier in this area two years on; iii) Notwithstanding the contents of the report the necessary work was not done prior to closure.
Although the primary responsibility for repair lay with the freeholders, Stylus had the ability to carry them out in default (Granada Theatres Ltd v Freehold Investment (Leytonstone) Ltd [1959] 1 Ch 592, 608), as indeed it did following the court order.
By continuing to invite the public to its premises it was causing loading by the public resulting in them and its employees being made subject (in the words of the HDL report) to unacceptable risk.
For Manolete, Mr Bowdery QC (who did not appear below) supports the view of the courts below on the interpretation of the word default, but submits also that the appeal fails on the facts.
As the Court of Appeal held, the council was unable to show that Stylus was in default of any legal obligation under either of the statutes relied on or otherwise.
Furthermore, there was nothing to show that the council had ever regarded Styluss use of its own premises as dangerous to the public or its employees, following its receipt of the HDL report in early 2005.
As the correspondence showed, and the Court of Appeal found, the motivation for the use of emergency powers was the prospect of large crowds at events unconnected with the use of the Stylus premises.
Discussion
With respect to the courts below, while recognising the somewhat different emphasis of the arguments in this court, there is a danger of over complication.
If one takes the words of section 106(1) at face value, they do not appear to pose any great difficulty either of interpretation or of application to the facts of this case.
The section gives a right to compensation to a person who has sustained damage by reason of the exercise of any of the authoritys powers under the Act in relation to a matter as to which he has not himself been in default.
This raises two questions: Is that a matter as to which the claimant has been in default? i) What was the matter in relation to which the authority has exercised its powers? ii)
It is important to keep in mind that the relevant power is the power to take emergency action under section 78.
The claim is for loss resulting from that emergency action, not from the order of the magistrates court, which itself carries no right to compensation.
That is why the claim is limited to the period from the date of closure until the order made on 12 September.
This point gains emphasis from section 78(7).
Even a claimant in default (in the relevant sense) is not precluded from seeking compensation, if the court determines that the authority were not justified in using their emergency power, rather than first seeking an order from the magistrates under section 77.
The right to compensation provides an important check on the unbridled use of that emergency power under section 78, in respect of which (unlike section 77) there is no right of objection or recourse to the court.
The councils decision to act under section 78 in this case is not itself in issue.
But it is necessary to identify the matter which led it to take such emergency action, rather than applying first to the magistrates court.
That is clearly identified by the evidence, in particular the letter sent to the tenants at the time.
It was not the general state of the pier, nor even the specific repairs identified in the HDL report on which Mr Gasztowicz relies.
The council had been aware of those matters at least since the receipt of that report in 2005, but had not thought it necessary to close the pier, nor to take any legal action against Stylus at that stage.
If they had wished to do so, there appears no reason why they could not have applied to the court for the appropriate order, giving Stylus the opportunity to make representations.
No issue of compensation would have then arisen.
As is clear from the councils letter to tenants, the matter which triggered the action in June 2006 was the state of the pier combined with fear of possible collapse from crowd loading during the events planned for that month, particularly the risk of overloading in an emergency evacuation.
Stylus was not legally responsible for the state of the pier, nor was it responsible for the events which triggered the councils action.
Whatever may have been its position as respects its clients and employees, it was not in default as to the matter which led to the councils use of section 78.
On this simple basis, in my view, the company is entitled to succeed.
That conclusion makes it strictly unnecessary to address the view of the courts below that default in section 106 referred only to default under the 1984 Act itself.
However, the council, no doubt supported by others with like responsibilities, is understandably concerned as to the potential implications of this limitation for future cases.
There seem to have been four main points leading to this conclusion: (i) the legislative history, (ii) other references to default in the 1984 Act, (iii) the wide scope of the factual inquiry implicit in the alternative approach, and (iv) various authorities under the predecessor statutes.
None of these considerations in my view supports the conclusion.
The first three points can be dealt with shortly.
The legislative history tends if anything to support the opposite view.
The use over more than 100 years of the same formula in statutes which, though covering the same general subject matter, included a varying range of powers, makes it unlikely that it was linked specifically to the particular provisions of each statute.
Jackson LJ was forced to accept that the similar formula in the Public Health Acts 1875 (section 308) and 1936 (section 278) must be read as extending to default under related Acts, such as local Building Acts and Improvement Acts (paras 52, 55).
I agree, but related is an imprecise term, not supported by anything in the wording of the section itself.
Once that extension is accepted, it is difficult to understand why it should not extend to other forms of legal default.
Secondly, the other references to default referred to by Jackson LJ do not assist.
In section 77(2)(b), the default in question is specified by the section itself, that is failure to comply with the magistrate courts order.
That throws no light on its meaning where it is not so limited.
Section 78(7) is related directly to section 106 and poses the same issue as is now before us.
Thirdly, the courts concern as to the wide ranging nature of the factual inquiry implied by the authoritys suggested approach is understandable, but it does not arise if the inquiry is limited in the way I have suggested above.
As to the authorities, the only one referred to by the Court of Appeal was Hobbs v Winchester Corpn [1910] 2 KB 471, which related to the equivalent compensation provision in the 1875 Act (section 308).
Meat had been seized under section 116 of the 1875 Act as unfit for human consumption.
Although the butcher was acquitted of any offence under section 117 of that Act, on the grounds that he was unaware that it was unfit for consumption, it was found that he was nonetheless in default for the purpose of section 308, so that his claim for compensation failed.
Since the only default relied on by the authority was default under the 1875 Act, that case throws no light on the nature of the default which might be relevant in other cases.
Mr Bowdery relies also on Place v Rawtenstall Corpn (1916) 86 LJKB 90, under a provision in a local Act giving the authority a defence from civil liability for damage caused in exercise of their statutory powers in default of the owner or other person required to do such work, and in the absence of negligence: section 257 of the Rawtenstall Corporation Act 1907 (emphasis added).
The authority had served notice under that Act requiring the claimant to convert a pail closet on his premises into a water closet and to connect it to a sewer.
He failed to comply, and the authority carried out the work themselves, but did so by carrying out a larger project serving some other houses.
In doing so, they used pipes larger than would have been needed by the claimant, thus causing subsidence to his property.
It was held that the authority could not rely on his default to defeat his claim for damages.
The judgment confirmed the essential principle that statutes interfering with common law rights should be strictly construed, and that it was for the authority to establish that the work which they have done is strictly work done in default of the owner.
The problem for the authority was that the work was not limited to the work the owner would have done to carry out the work for his own house, but comprised much more.
There was no finding that the damage was only caused by the work which Mr Place was required to do (pp 92 94 per Scrutton J).
That seems to me a decision turning on its own particular facts, which throws no light on the meaning of the word default in the present context.
I should also mention two authorities referred to in argument on the word default in the provisions relating to statutory nuisances under the 1875 and 1936 Acts.
Clayton v Sale Urban District Council [1926] 1 KB 415 concerned action by the authority in respect of an alleged statutory nuisance caused by flooding.
Under section 94 of the 1875 Act they could serve an abatement notice on the person by whose act default or sufferance the nuisance had arisen.
The authority argued that the nuisance had arisen by the default of the owner, in failing to repair the bank.
It was argued that there could not be default by the owner within the meaning of the section unless there had been a breach of an obligation arising independently of the section from an agreement or otherwise, and that he was not under any agreement or covenant or otherwise to construct or to repair the flood bank (pp 423 424).
This argument was rejected.
Lord Hewart CJ said: In my opinion the act, default, or sufferance referred to in section 94 of the Public Health Act 1875, is an act, default, or sufferance related to the nuisance which it is sought to abate, and default no less than sufferance within the meaning of that section can occur without the breach of an obligation arising from contractual agreement. (p 425) He referred to the common law duty of the owner of a vacant piece of land to prevent that land from being a public nuisance (citing Attorney General v Tod Heatley [1897] 1 Ch 560, 566).
Contrary to Mr Bowderys submissions, that is to my mind clear authority at that level that the word default in a comparable context was not confined to default under the statute itself.
Neath Rural District Council v Williams [1951] 1 KB 115 concerned the equivalent provision of the 1936 Act (section 93).
A watercourse on the defendants land had become silted by natural causes and caused flooding.
Section 259(1)(b), under which a watercourse in such a condition was a statutory nuisance, was subject to a proviso that no liability was imposed on any person other than the person by whose act or default the nuisance arises or continues.
It was held that, absent any relevant legal duty on him under statute or at common law to take positive action to remove the nuisance, the defendant was not in default.
In the words of the headnote: in the case of a natural stream a landowner had no duty at common law to keep the bed clear by removing obstructions which might arise from natural causes, and the proviso to (section 259(1)) was designed to prevent any additional duty from being cast on the landowner Lord Goddard CJ expressed some doubt about the actual decision in Clayton but felt able to distinguish it on the basis that it was concerned with the words act, default or sufferance whereas the proviso to section 259(1)(b) referred only to act or default (p 126).
However, he did not doubt the proposition that default could arise from breach of a duty outside the Act itself.
Ramsey J, at para 43, referred to a passage in the judgment of Lord Goddard CJ, who said: I do not think that in this case default could mean merely doing nothing, unless an obligation to do something were imposed by the Act.
There was no act of the defendants which caused the obstruction either to arise or to continue In the present case, on the facts found by the justices, there is nothing to show that the defendants did anything which caused this obstruction to arise or to continue; nor do I think that there is anything which can properly be called a default on their part (pp 126 127, emphasis added).
This passage cannot be taken as implying that only a duty under the 1936 Act itself was thought relevant.
It must be read in the context of the judgment as a whole, in which the possibility of a common law duty had previously been discussed and dismissed (pp 120, 123).
I conclude that there is nothing in the factors relied on in the courts below which requires the words in default to be limited to default under the 1984 Act.
They were right in my view to hold that the authority had no defence in principle to the claim for compensation, not because (as they held) there was no default under the 1984 Act, but because it was not default by Stylus which led to the emergency action under section 78.
It is important to emphasise that this conclusion does not limit in any way the issues which may be taken into account by the arbitrator in assessing compensation attributable to that action, including the statutory and common law responsibilities of Stylus to its clients and employees.
As Jackson LJ indicated (para 95), it will be open to the authority to argue that the consequent loss of profit to the business must be substantially reduced due to the structural condition of the pier and the implications it would have had for the continuation of its business quite apart from the effects of the emergency notice.
Mr Gasztowicz drew our attention to an earlier paragraph of Jackson LJ (para 79) which might suggest a more limited role for the arbitrator.
Having agreed with the judge that the phrase in default means in breach of an obligation under the 1984 Act, he added: The provision does not require the court or the arbitrator to conduct a wide ranging review of other legislation and the common law in order to see whether the claimant is in breach of any duties arising outside the 1984 Act. (emphasis added) I do not fully understand the inclusion in that passage of a reference to the arbitrator, as well as the court.
In so far as it implies a limitation on the scope of the arbitrators function it is inconsistent with the later paragraph to which I have referred, and which in my view expresses the correct position.
For these reasons, albeit differing in some respects from those of the courts below, I would dismiss the appeal.
","In June 2006 the Appellant, Hastings Borough Council (the Council), exercised its emergency powers to restrict public access to Hastings Pier on account of its being in a dangerous condition as a result of serious structural defects.
The Respondent, Manolete Partners PLC (Manolete), pursued a claim for compensation against the Council for loss to business as a result of the Councils emergency closure of the pier.
Manolete brought the claim as an assignee of the business Stylus Sports Ltd (Stylus), which went into liquidation in late 2011.
Stylus had leased two units from the freeholder of the pier, Ravenclaw Investments Incorporated (Ravenclaw), and had operated a bingo hall and amusement arcade.
Two years before the closure of the pier, Stylus had commissioned a structural engineering survey of the pier, which advised that urgent and future work, within a year, was required to the structure of the pier to prevent an unacceptable risk to the public.
Ravenclaw, which was responsible as landlord for repair and renewal of the pier structure, did not take action to remedy the defects identified.
Nor did the Council, and the pier remained open to the public.
In April 2006, a section of tension cord fell from the pier.
This led the Council to attempt, unsuccessfully, to compel Ravenclaw to take action, and to commission its own structural integrity report, which in June 2006 recommended immediate restrictions on access to the pier.
The Council exercised its emergency powers under section 78 of the 1984 Act, and in September 2006 obtained a court order under section 77, prohibiting public access to the pier until the necessary remedial works had been carried out.
Section 106 of the Building Act 1984 (the 1984 Act), requires compensation to be paid for loss to a business resulting from emergency action, but only where the owner or occupier of the premises has not been in default.
The Council alleged that Stylus had breached the Occupiers Liability Act 1957, which imposes a duty of care towards visitors, and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, which imposes a duty on an employer to ensure the safety of his employees and the safety of the workplace.
The Council sought to rely on these alleged breaches to establish a default, thereby precluding Manolete from making a compensation claim under the 1984 Act.
This defence was rejected by the Technology and Construction Court and the Court of Appeal, on the basis that the reference to default was limited default in respect of obligations imposed by the 1984 Act itself.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Hastings Borough Councils appeal.
Lord Carnwath gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.
Section 106 of the 1984 Act gives a right to compensation to a person who has sustained damage by reason of the exercise of the authoritys powers under the Act in relation to a matter as to which he has not himself been in default.
This requires firstly, identification of the matter in relation to which authority has exercised its powers, and secondly, consideration of whether that is a matter as to which the claimant has been in default [25].
The relevant power is the power to take emergency action under section 78 of the 1984 Act, and the claim for compensation is limited to the period from the date of the Councils emergency closure of the pier until the court order in September 2006 [26].
The matter which led the Council to take such emergency action was identified in the letter sent by the Council to the tenants at the time, which was the state of the pier combined with fear of possible collapse from crowd loading during the events planned for that month, in particular the risk of overloading in an emergency evacuation.
The trigger was not the general state of the pier or the specific repairs identified in the report commissioned by Stylus.
Whatever Stylus position towards its clients and employees, it was not in default as to the matter which led to the Councils exercise of its section 78 powers, and on this basis, Manolete is entitled to succeed in its claim for compensation [27 8].
Although not strictly necessary to determine the present appeal, Lord Carnwath addresses the issue of whether default in section 106 is limited to default under the 1984 Act itself, as this may impact on future cases.
Lord Carnwath finds that the legislative history and the authorities under the predecessor statutes support the conclusion that the default is not limited to the particular provisions of each statute, but extends to other forms of legal default.
Concerns as to the wide scope of the factual inquiry do not arise if the inquiry is limited to the two stage assessment set out above [30 5].
The Court of Appeals conclusion that the Council had no defence in principle to the claim for compensation was correct, not because, as they so held, there was no default under the 1984 Act, but because it was not Stylus default which led to the Councils emergency action [36].
Lord Carnwath emphasises that this does not limit the issues which can be taken into account by the arbitrator in assessing the level of compensation payable.
The arbitrator may take account of Stylus statutory and common law responsibilities to its clients and employees, the structural condition of the pier and the implications it would have had for the continuation of business quite apart from the effects of the emergency action [37].
"
uksc-2018-0132,"Mr Thomas Arthur Watkins lived near Tredegar in South Wales.
He was employed by the National Coal Board (later British Coal Corporation) (British Coal) as a miner from 1964 until 1985.
In that employment he was required to use vibratory tools and as a result of such exposure, in common with very many other miners, Mr Watkins developed Vibration White Finger (VWF) which is a form of Hand/Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS).
He first experienced the symptoms, which consist of whitening, stiffness, numbness and tingling of the fingers of both hands, not later than the early 1980s.
After he left the employment of British Coal in 1985, he worked as a driver of road sweeping vehicles until he retired in 1997.
Shortly after that he was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both knees which became increasingly acute.
One symptom of VWF can be a reduction in grip strength and manual dexterity in the fingers.
A common, although not invariable, consequence is that a person suffering from these conditions becomes unable, without assistance, to carry out routine domestic tasks such as gardening, do it yourself or car maintenance.
The Scheme
A group of test cases, representative of some 25,000 similar claims, established that British Coal had been negligent in failing to take reasonable steps to limit the exposure of employed miners to VWF from the excessive use of vibratory tools (Armstrong v British Coal Corpn [1998] CLY 975).
As a result, the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), which had assumed responsibility for British Coals relevant liabilities, set up a scheme in 1999 to provide tariff based compensation to miners who suffered from VWF as a result of exposure to excessive vibration (the Scheme).
The Scheme was administered pursuant to a Claims Handling Arrangement (the CHA) dated 22 January 1999 and made between the DTI and a group of solicitors firms representing claimant miners suffering from VWF.
The central objective of the CHA was to enable very large numbers of similar claims to be presented, examined and resolved expeditiously.
The Scheme contemplated the making of two main types of compensatory award to miners suffering from VWF, corresponding broadly with general and special damages for personal injuries.
The Scheme provided for compensation to be paid for pain, suffering and loss of amenity (General Damages), and for handicap on the labour market and other financial losses (Special Damages) including past and/or future loss of earnings.
Pursuant to a Services Agreement dated 9 May 2000 the special damages could include a services award for qualifying miners in respect of the need for assistance in performing domestic tasks.
Under the Scheme, each claimant was required to complete a questionnaire on his work history and IRISC, the claims handling organisation which acted on behalf of the DTI, would then allocate him to a particular occupational group, depending on his likely exposure to vibration.
He would then undergo a medical examination in accordance with a defined Medical Assessment Process (MAP) by a doctor appointed under the Scheme.
The resulting MAP 1 report was in standard format and was intended to determine whether the claimant suffered from VWF and, if so, the severity of the condition by reference to the stagings on the Stockholm Workshop Scale.
The V score was a measure of the vascular symptoms and depended largely on reporting from the patient.
The extension of blanching was recorded diagrammatically by the examining doctor.
The sensori neural signs and symptoms were assessed partly from the claimants account and partly by standardised testing, the results of which were recorded as Sn markings.
It was open to a claimant to challenge the findings of the MAP 1 report but there was no provision for IRISC to do so.
Within 56 days of receipt of the MAP 1 report IRISC was obliged to make an offer of compensation or to reject the claim with reasons.
The Services Agreement of 9 May 2000 was incorporated in the CHA as Schedule 7(1).
It recorded an agreed approach to compensation for services.
The respective medical experts of the parties to the Scheme rejected the idea that there should be an individual assessment of each claimants ability to carry out particular household tasks.
Instead it was agreed that an assumption be made that once the condition had reached a certain level(s) causation it should be presumed that a man could no longer carry out certain tasks without assistance.
The examining doctor would then merely have to consider whether there were any other conditions (VWF apart) which of themselves would have prevented the man from undertaking the task in question thereby rebutting the presumption. (Schedule 7.1, paragraph 3.1(ii)) Six tasks were identified for this purpose: gardening work, window cleaning, do it yourself, decorating, car washing and car maintenance (Schedule 7.1, paragraph 3.3).
Claims under the Services Agreement were processed in the following way.
The experts produced a matrix identifying in respect of each staging of 2V and 2Sn late, or higher, the tasks for which a claimant would be presumed to require assistance.
Once a claimant had a staging of at least 2V or 2Sn late, a claimant was entitled to a services award if he had previously performed one of the identified tasks, but now required assistance to do so as a result of his VWF.
Men at 2V on the scale would be expected to have difficulty with all tasks except do it yourself and decorating and at 3V would be expected to have difficulty with decorating.
It was further assumed that the condition would not have deteriorated since cessation of exposure to vibration (Schedule 7.1, paragraphs 4.1, 4.2).
A claimant did not have to show that his condition wholly disabled or prevented him from carrying out the relevant task.
It was enough that he could no longer carry it out without assistance.
The approach left to be determined when a claimant reached the relevant stages, whether he suffered from any other conditions which would have prevented him from continuing to carry out any tasks in any event (co morbidity), and, if so, what that condition was, when it developed and the extent to which it compromised his ability to carry out the relevant tasks expressed on a scale of nil, material, moderate, serious and complete (Schedule 7.1, paragraphs 3.7, 5.1).
Factual evidence concerning a services claim was presented by a simple questionnaire completed by the claimant.
Because it would be impracticable to investigate individual claims in any detail, the Scheme provided that broad assumptions will be made about the average assistance that would be required for the particular task by the individual at the relevant stage (Schedule 7.1, paragraph 6.7).
Schedule 7 stated that practical and other considerations militate against other than a tariff based approach given the number of claims and the need for a quick, efficient and inexpensive approach to their settlement. (Schedule 7, paragraph 6.2) In addition, a claimants most recent helpers would complete questionnaires.
A claimant would then be sent for a further medical examination (MAP 2) which was solely concerned to consider whether there were any other conditions which, of themselves, would have prevented the claimant from undertaking the task in question.
A claimant was not usually contacted by IRISC concerning his claim, but helpers were.
This normally consisted of a telephone interview, which might last 15 minutes, during which the helper would be asked whether he or she had assisted with the tasks claimed and, if so, when they started to do so.
Even where the helper was out by a few years on dates, the information in the questionnaire would still be accepted.
On receipt of the questionnaires, IRISC would consider each claim on its merits, adopting a pragmatic approach.
If IRISC did not accept the claim entirely it had to set out in detail the reasons for rejecting the claim in whole or part.
Compensation was calculated by application of a multiplier/multiplicand approach and an index linked tariff was set in respect of each task according to the particular staging.
IRISC could reject a claim for services in whole or in part if a claimants work history after leaving the mining industry was such as to indicate that his ability to carry out the relevant tasks was not impaired.
However, in order to be entitled to rebut the presumption that a man with a particular claimants stagings could not carry out the relevant tasks without assistance, IRISC had to discharge the burden of establishing that the work actually carried out by the claimant was such as to demonstrate that he could reasonably be expected to carry out all aspects of the task without assistance.
Pending resolution of the services claim, a claimant was entitled to receive an interim payment in respect of his claim for general damages and handicap on the labour market.
Mr Watkinss claim
In February 1999 Mr Watkins instructed Hugh James Ford Simey Solicitors (the appellant) to act for him in relation to a claim under the Scheme.
His claim was notified to the DTIs claims handlers on 10 February 1999.
By November 1999 Mrs Barbara Kinsey, litigation solicitor within the appellant firm, had assumed responsibility for many VWF claims, including that of Mr Watkins, at the appellants office in Bargoed and, from 2001, Treharris.
On 31 January 2000 Mr Watkins underwent an interview and examination performed in part by Dr Chadha, a general practitioner appointed under the Scheme, and in part by an unnamed laboratory technician, to assess whether he was suffering from VWF and, if so, how his condition should be categorised under the Stockholm Workshop Scale for its vascular and sensorineural components.
This was referred to as a Medical Assessment Process 1 (MAP 1) examination.
In a report dated 3 February 2000 Dr Chadha indicated that Mr Watkins suffered from VWF with stagings of 3V and 3Sn bilaterally (ie in both hands).
Those stagings were sufficient for Mr Watkins to obtain general damages and to entitle him to a presumption in his favour that he satisfied the qualifying requirements for a services award.
Mr Watkins did choose to seek a services award.
He and his assistants completed the necessary questionnaires which were sent to the DTIs claims handlers on 23 March 2001.
They initially sought to deny Mr Watkinss entire claim on the basis that he had not been exposed to excessive vibration while working for British Coal.
The appellant challenged that decision and eventually the claims handlers were persuaded to accept Mr Watkinss claim under the Scheme.
As a result of this delay, it was not until 12 February 2003 that the claims handlers wrote to the appellant, offering Mr Watkins the sum of 9,478 in full and final settlement of all [Mr Watkinss] claims arising out of his exposure to vibration during the course of his employment with the British Coal Corporation. 9,478 was the tariff award for general damages to which Mr Watkins would have been entitled under the Scheme on the basis of the stagings of 3V and 3Sn bilaterally.
The offer made did not include any allowance for a services award.
The appellant wrote to Mr Watkins on 18 February 2003, reporting the offer which had been received and advising him as to what would be involved should he wish to proceed with a special damages claim.
On 23 February 2003 Mr Watkins spoke by telephone with Mrs Kinsey at the appellant and told her that he didnt want to proceed any further with the special damages claim as he had other conditions and had had various operations which in his view prevented him from carrying out certain tasks.
He indicated that he was quite happy to continue with general damages only and would accept the offer.
Mr Watkins completed a form of acceptance on 24 February 2003 and the appellant wrote to the claims handlers on 27 February 2003 accepting the offer in full and final settlement of Mr Watkinss VWF claim against British Coal.
The professional negligence proceedings
Nearly five years later, in January 2008, Mr Watkins, having seen a newspaper advertisement offering assistance to any ex miner who may have had his VWF claim settled at an undervalue, instructed fresh solicitors, who issued proceedings against the appellant on 11 August 2010.
By the amended particulars of claim it is contended that as a result of the appellants negligence, Mr Watkins has lost the opportunity to bring a services claim under the Scheme or otherwise.
That lost opportunity is quantified at 6,126.22 plus interest.
On 22 October 2010, His Honour Judge Hawkesworth QC made an order in relation to a number of claims against solicitors arising out of the Scheme, directing that disputes about expert evidence and disclosure be dealt with at a hearing before him.
The six test cases identified in the order did not include Mr Watkinss claim.
Following a hearing, by order dated 3 May 2011 Judge Hawkesworth ordered that his directions should apply to all prospective and existing claims alleging negligence against solicitors in the context of the advice given by those solicitors in respect of claims for damages [under the Scheme].
He directed that expert evidence should be obtained in the form of a report by a single joint expert.
A schedule to the order set out a standard form letter of instruction to such a single joint expert in terms approved by the judge.
That standard form was adopted in the letter dated 21 January 2013 by which the parties to the present proceedings jointly instructed Mr Tennant, a consultant vascular surgeon.
It stated: It is an issue in the proceedings whether Mr Watkins would, if properly advised, in fact have brought a Services claim at all.
Whether Mr Watkins was, as a result of HAVS, in fact disabled from carrying out (in whole or in part) the tasks he alleges would have formed the basis of his Services claim is relevant to that issue.
Accordingly, we wish jointly to instruct you to carry out a medical examination of Mr Watkins and, on the basis of that examination and your consideration of the documents referred to below and attached to this letter, to prepare a report stating your opinion as to whether Mr Watkins is and was at any time from the date of onset of HAVS symptoms: (1) Disabled by HAVS as a matter of fact and, to the extent that he was, unable to carry out (in whole or in part), without assistance, the tasks which he alleges would have formed the basis of his Services Claim; and (2) Suffering from any co morbid medical condition which would, in any event, have affected his ability to carry out those tasks without assistance.
In relation to co morbidity, could you please express your opinion as to whether any such co morbidity was at any time since the date of onset of HAVS symptoms: nil; minor; moderate; serious; complete (ie would have prevented the carrying out of the task in any event) If, in the course of your medical examination, you conclude that Mr Watkins does not, in fact, suffer from HAVS, you should report that opinion in your Report.
The letter made clear that the expert was not to apply in Mr Watkinss favour the presumption under the Scheme that he could no longer carry out the relevant tasks without assistance by reason of his VWF staging.
Mr Tennant examined Mr Watkins and, in a report dated 17 May 2013, he stated: Mr Watkins gives a good description of vasospasm and is graded 1V in this report as the white discolouration reaches the distal interphalangeal joint.
The only abnormality on testing was of a mild lack of dexterity.
As there is no other sensory loss in a warm environment, in my opinion this amounts only to HAVS grade Sn1.
There is certainly no justification for Sn3 at this examination, and to reach Sn2 would require evidence of reduced sensory perception, which I could not demonstrate.
Grading of 1V, 1Sn would not be expected to produce any disability in the domains tested below.
In response to further questions from Mr Watkinss solicitors, Mr Tennant confirmed on 23 June 2013 that Mr Watkins met the criteria for the diagnosis of HAVS.
He further stated that it was apparent at interview that the client had devolved certain tasks to others in the long term.
Mr Watkins died in January 2014 at the age of 72.
His daughter, Mrs Jean Edwards, was appointed to continue the claim on behalf of Mr Watkinss estate.
The trial of the claim against the appellant took place in the County Court at Leeds before Mr Recorder Miller in March 2016.
The parties had permission to rely on Mr Tennants written evidence at trial but an application by the appellant, made in advance of trial, for permission to call Mr Tennant was refused and that order was not appealed.
The statements of Mr Watkins were admitted as hearsay evidence.
In a reserved judgment, handed down on 16 May 2016, the judge held that the claim in negligence was not time barred, that the advice contained in the appellants letter dated 18 February 2003 had been negligent and that if Mr Watkins had received appropriate advice, he would probably have decided to reject the settlement offer of 9,478 and would have continued to pursue his services claim.
However, the judge also held that Mr Watkins had suffered no loss and accordingly he dismissed the claim against the appellant.
He observed: If, as here, expert or other evidence which post dates the settlement or other disposal of the original claim, establishes beyond any (or any but negligible) doubt that the claim could and would have been resolved only in one specific way had that evidence been available to the parties and the tribunal at the time, then the Court in the professional negligence action has the full facts adverted to by Laws LJ in Whitehead [v Searle [2009] 1 WLR 549, para 20] and should find accordingly, thereby avoiding an uncovenanted windfall or correcting injustice to a claimant whose case has turned out to be undoubtedly stronger than had been previously assumed.
In the case of Mr Watkins, I can and should find that his chose in action has been shown to have had no value given the damages actually paid to him; another way of putting it is that, as I have found on the full facts, his services claim had no chance of success, for the same reason: it is beyond a peradventure that faced with Mr Tennants clinical findings and conclusions any award would have fallen short of 9,478.
It is fanciful to assume otherwise.
The judge took that view because on the consultants findings Mr Watkins would only have been offered 1,790 for general damages and a services claim would not have been possible.
On appeal to the Court of Appeal (Underhill, Irwin and Singh LJJ) the appeal was allowed: [2018] PNLR 30.
The Court of Appeal, influenced by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Perry v Raleys Solicitors [2017] PNLR 27 (more recently reversed by this Court [2019] 2 WLR 636) held that the trial judge had been wrong to conduct a trial within a trial to determine the value of Mr Watkinss claim against the DTI and to determine the severity of his VWF.
It further held that the judge had been wrong to determine these matters on the basis of the evidence of Mr Tennant, since that evidence would not have been available at the time of Mr Watkinss notional services claim under the Scheme.
Irwin LJ observed (at para 70) that it would be particularly inappropriate to lose sight of what would have been the outcome under the Scheme by reference to after coming evidence which would not have been brought into being at the time.
The Court of Appeal further acknowledged exceptions in the case of fraud and in cases, such as Whitehead v Searle [2009] 1 WLR 549, where the consequences of a supervening event were of such a significant or serious scale that public policy required a departure from normal principles in order to do justice between the parties.
In its view, such circumstances did not exist in the present case.
The appellant now appeals to this court with the permission of this court.
Although the appellant sought to appeal on 14 (partly overlapping) grounds, permission was limited to the sole question of whether the prospects of success of the claim are to be judged as at the date when the claim was lost or at the date when damages are awarded and it directed that the parties consider the relevance of the principle in Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries (1891) Ltd v Pontypridd Waterworks Co [1903] AC 426, namely that where the court assessing damages has knowledge of what has actually happened it should not speculate about what might have happened but base itself on what is now known to have happened. (See McGregor on Damages, 20th ed (2018), para 10 118.).
Although this was the reason why permission to appeal was granted, the Court has concluded, in the light of the wide ranging arguments presented to us, that the Bwllfa principle is not relevant in the particular circumstances of this case.
On behalf of the appellant, Mr Michael Pooles QC submits that the trial judge was right to rely on the evidence of Mr Tennant for four reasons. (1) In the circumstances of this case, the question whether Mr Watkins had suffered loss should be determined as at the date of the trial of the claim against the appellant, applying the Bwllfa principle. (2) In a professional negligence claim arising from personal injury litigation, the issue of loss should be determined as at the date of the trial of the professional negligence proceedings as it would have been in personal injury litigation (Golden Strait Corpn v Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha (The Golden Victory) [2007] 2 AC 353, per Lord Bingham of Cornhill at para 13). (3) Even if the issue of loss should be determined at an earlier date, the Court should in making that determination take account of all of the evidence available at the trial of the professional negligence proceedings, following the decisions in Charles v Hugh James Jones & Jenkins [2000] 1 WLR 1278, Dudarec v Andrews [2006] 1 WLR 3002 and Whitehead v Searle, as this would enable the court to make a more accurate assessment of what the original personal injury claim was actually worth. (4) That evidence was needed in the present case to enable the issue of loss to be determined with all the adversarial rigour of a trial as required by the Supreme Court in Perry v Raleys Solicitors: [2019] 2 WLR 636, para 19.
On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richard Copnall submits that the court should assess the prospects of success as at the date when the claim was lost, on the facts as they were and the evidence available at that time, subject to the following established exceptions. (1) Evidence that would have been available, in the absence of negligence, at the time the claim was lost will be admissible (Charles; Dudarec v Andrews [2006] 1 WLR 3002). (2) Evidence of the original parties attitude to settlement at the time that the claim was lost will be admissible (Somatra Ltd v Sinclair Roche and Temperley [2003] 2 Lloyds Rep 855). (3) Evidence of dishonesty or misconduct will be admissible (Perry; Green v Collyer Bristow [1999] Lloyds Law Rep PN 798). (4) Evidence of any accomplished fact within the meaning of the Bwllfa principle will be admissible.
Discussion
We are concerned with a claim in the tort of negligence.
Although the claim for breach of contract was time barred, the judge held that, by virtue of section 14A of the Limitation Act 1980, as inserted by section 1 of the Latent Damage Act 1986 (Special time limit for negligence actions where facts relevant to cause of action are not known at date of accrual), the claim in negligence was not.
In order to succeed in negligence against Mr Watkins former solicitors his estate had to establish a negligent breach of duty, causation and loss.
A negligent breach of duty was found by the judge, on the basis that the appellants letter of 18 February 2003 was misleading and deficient in a number of respects and those features were not corrected in the subsequent conversation between Mr Watkins and Mrs Kinsey on 23 February 2003.
There has been no appeal against that conclusion.
In addition, the judge made a finding that, had Mr Watkins received non negligent advice, he would have pursued an honest services claim.
That claim had already been notified and supporting statements provided.
The judge considered that, had Mr Watkins been more fully and accurately informed as to where he stood and how the scheme operated, he would probably have instructed Mrs Kinsey to let the services claim and a MAP 2 medical examination proceed.
The judge expressly rejected the submission on behalf of the appellants that, in reality, Mr Watkins had realised that his evidence in support of the services claim was grossly exaggerated or invented and, as a result, he had discontinued it for fear of getting into trouble or losing out financially further down the line.
There has been no appeal against that conclusion.
Accordingly, the issue considered by the Supreme Court in Perry v Raleys Solicitors does not arise in this case and, in my view, that decision has no direct bearing on the issues which we have to decide.
For the claim by Mr Watkinss estate to succeed, however, it is also necessary to prove loss.
There is a legal burden on the estate to prove that in losing the opportunity to pursue the claim Mr Watkins has lost something of value ie that his claim had a real and substantial rather than merely a negligible prospect of success.
It is only if the estate can establish that Mr Watkinss chances of success in pursuing his service claim were more than negligible that it is appropriate to go on to evaluate those chances on a loss of chance basis by making a realistic assessment of what would have happened had the original claim been pursued (Mount v Barker Austin [1998] PNLR 493 per Simon Brown LJ at pp 510D to 511C).
In the view of Mr Recorder Miller, the present claim failed at the first hurdle.
On the basis of the evidence of Mr Tennant the judge considered that Mr Watkinss chose in action had no value given the damages actually paid to him.
It was clear, in his view, that any award would have fallen short of the 9,478 which Mr Watkins had already received under the settlement.
Against this background, the argument before this court has focussed on the issue of the admissibility in a professional negligence action of subsequently acquired evidence relating to the value of the original claim, an issue on which we have heard elaborate submissions.
However, it is not necessary to express a concluded view in relation to these matters because the evidence contained in Mr Tennants report was not relevant to any issue before the court in the professional negligence proceedings.
As a result, the authorities relied on by the appellant are not relevant in the particular circumstances of this case.
It is important not to lose sight of the fact that Mr Watkinss original claim was a claim within the Scheme and not one made in the course of conventional civil litigation.
It is necessary to consider whether Mr Watkinss original claim, which was accepted by the judge to be an honest claim, was of more than negligible value within the context of the Scheme.
When the evidence of Mr Tennant is considered in this light, it is not the knock out blow which the appellant suggests.
The Scheme has been described by Irwin LJ in the Court of Appeal and by counsel before us as a rough and ready scheme.
This is a fair description.
It was intended to provide an efficient and economic system for dealing with a huge number of claims in a way that was broadly fair.
No doubt, it was considered that the decision not to require a detailed medical assessment of the level of disability of every claimant for a services award was justified by the savings in cost.
A deliberate decision was taken to deal with services claims by reference to presumptions derived from the diagnosis and staging found at MAP 1, as opposed to requiring a precise assessment of the underlying disability.
Medical assessment in the MAP 2 procedure was to be limited to the issue of co morbidity.
More specifically, there was no provision within the Scheme whereby the DTI could appeal against a general award, nor did the Scheme contemplate reopening or reassessing the diagnosis or staging of the condition or the entitlement to a general award established at MAP 1.
Recoverability under the Scheme, therefore, did not depend on entitlement at common law nor did it correspond with what might have been the outcome in conventional civil proceedings.
In this case Mr Watkins lost the value of his claim under the Scheme as it would have been administered in accordance with its terms.
In this regard it is instructive to consider why Judge Hawkesworth QC made the order in the professional negligence proceedings for further medical reports.
In his judgment of 3 May 2011, he explained that it was common ground that the claims were for the lost chance to bring a claim under the MAP 2 procedure.
On behalf of the claimants it was contended that the scope of the medical evidence should be a replication of the MAP 2 procedure which was limited to the issue of comorbidity, while on behalf of the defendants it was contended, initially at least, that there should be a more comprehensive medical examination by a consultant specialist which could revisit the original diagnosis of VWF as well as address the issue of comorbidity.
For the claimants it was submitted that because the MAP 2 examination did not revisit or reopen the original diagnosis it would not be appropriate for the medical expert in the professional negligence proceedings to address them.
During the hearing, however, it became clear that counsel for the defendants were not contending for a medical examination in order to revisit the diagnosis and staging of the VWF condition, but in order to evaluate the claimants case on causation ie in order to assess whether a claimants failure to pursue a services claim arose from negligent advice or from an inability to assert truthfully that he had lost the ability to perform those specified activities which would enable him to bring a claim for a services award.
It was said that the extent of disability was relevant to that issue, while the medical examination in the MAP 1 procedure was predominantly directed at diagnosis and staging of the condition as opposed to the level of disability.
Miss Foster [who appeared for four defendant firms of solicitors] did not seek to say that the fact of a MAP 1 diagnosis and its consequences for the subsequent progression to a services claim could be called into question.
However, the defendants were entitled to investigate the implied averment that had the claimant been properly advised he would have made a services claim. (at para 7) The judge seems to have made the order for expert reports on that basis but expressly left open (at para 9) the question as to the extent to which any findings by an examining doctor could or could not be taken into account in valuing the loss of a chance to bring a services claim.
The joint letter of instruction sent to Mr Tennant on 21 January 2015 (set out at para 13, above) reflected this reasoning.
As a result, the instructions and the resulting medical examination and report departed significantly from those in a MAP 2 procedure.
Most significantly, the expert was not to apply the presumption resulting from the diagnosis and staging at MAP 1 which applied under the Scheme.
Mr Tennants report may have been relevant to the issue of causation in the claim by Mr Watkinss estate against his former solicitors.
However, the judge decided that issue in favour of the estate, finding that if Mr Watkins had received non negligent advice he would have pursued an honest services claim.
That conclusion has not been challenged on appeal.
In my view, Mr Tennants report is not relevant to the issue of loss.
We must assume that had Mr Watkins pursued a services claim the Scheme would have operated in accordance with its provisions.
The conclusion of Dr Chadha that Mr Watkins was suffering at the level of 3V, 3Sn bilaterally had entitled him, under the tariffs applied within the Scheme, to an award of general damages of 9,478 and also created a rebuttable presumption that he did require assistance with the tasks prescribed under Schedule 7 of CHA.
Mr Watkins would have had to undergo a second medical examination but that would have been limited to assessing co morbidity.
There would have been no equivalent of Mr Tennants report, no reassessment of the diagnosis or staging found in the MAP 1 procedure and no reduction of the general award.
Entitlement to a services award would have been decided in accordance with the procedure described at paras 4 8 above.
The appellant now seeks to add to the counterfactual situation the effect of a further medical examination and report which would never have been commissioned.
There is no justification for such a modification of the counterfactual situation and the judge erred in taking it into account when concluding that the lost claim was of no value.
When Mr Tennant conducted his examination of Mr Watkins and prepared his report, he acted in accordance with his instructions in expressing his view as to whether and to what extent Mr Watkins was disabled by HAVS as a matter of fact and, to the extent he was, unable to carry out without assistance the tasks which formed the basis of his services claim.
His opinion is set out at para 14 above.
However, he then proceeded to set out his opinion on co morbidity in accordance with the Scheme by taking as his starting point the conclusions of Dr Chadha (3V, 3Sn) as in the MAP 1 report and grading disability for the purpose of a services claim on that basis.
In doing so he provided an insight into the value of the claim which Mr Watkins lost.
For each of the five activities relevant to Mr Watkinss case (car washing, car maintenance, gardening, DIY and decorating) his disability is assessed as complete.
Mr Tennant states that on the basis of the MAP 1 report his HAVS would be expected to produce severe or complete disability in the tested domains.
The only comorbidity to take into account is Mr Watkinss arthritic knees and this results in a comorbidity finding of moderate in all of the tested domains other than gardening where the finding is severe.
In these circumstances I am unable to accept that the services claim had no chance of success and that the claim lost was of no value.
At the heart of this case lies Mr Pooless assertion that Mr Tennants report shows that because of an error Mr Watkins had already been over compensated and that a professional negligence claim should reflect his true entitlement to just compensation and not what would have been an uncovenanted windfall.
However, this overlooks the nature and operation of the Scheme.
The payment of a services award to Mr Watkins would simply have been a consequence of the way in which the Scheme operated and was intended to operate.
We are not concerned here with a claim in conventional civil proceedings but with a scheme possessing unusual features.
The evidence in question, the report of Mr Tennant, is simply not relevant when constructing the counterfactual situation which would have arisen if Mr Watkinss solicitors had fulfilled their duty to him.
I consider, therefore, that the Recorder erred in concluding that Mr Watkinss services claim could and would have been resolved only in one specific way had Mr Tennants report, or its equivalent, been available to IRISC and in concluding that the claim had been shown to have no value given the award already paid.
On the contrary, Mr Watkins had lost a claim under the Scheme of some value and the Recorder should have proceeded to assess its value on a loss of opportunity basis.
I would therefore dismiss the appeal and remit the matter for assessment of the value of the loss of the opportunity to pursue the services claim.
","This appeal relates to a compensation scheme (the Scheme) set up in 1999 by the Department for Trade and Industry to provide tariff based compensation to miners employed by the British Coal Corporation (British Coal) who suffered from a medical condition called vibration white finger (VWF) as a result of excessive exposure to vibration through the use of vibratory tools.
The Scheme provided for compensation to be paid for pain, suffering and loss of amenity (General Damages) and handicap on the labour market and other financial losses including past and/or future loss of earnings (Special Damages), which could include a services award to cover the need for assistance in performing specified domestic tasks.
Rather than conducting an individual assessment of each claimants ability to carry out the specified tasks, the Scheme applied a presumption based on the condition reaching a certain level of severity.
Mr Arthur Watkins was employed by British Coal as a miner from 1964 until 1985 and had developed VWF by the early 1980s.
In 1999 he instructed the appellant to act for him in relation to a claim under the Scheme.
Findings from a medical examination and interview indicated that Mr Watkins could obtain General Damages and qualified for the presumption in his favour that he satisfied the requirements for a services award.
Mr Watkins sought a services award.
In 2003 he was instead offered the tariff award for General Damages in full and final settlement of his claims.
The appellant wrote to Mr Watkins on 18 February 2003 reporting the offer.
After a telephone conversation with an employee of the appellant, Mr Watkins accepted the offer.
In 2008, Mr Watkins instructed new solicitors to bring a claim against the appellant for professional negligence, on the basis that as a result of the appellants negligence Mr Watkins had lost the opportunity to bring a services claim under the Scheme.
Mr Watkins died in 2014 and his daughter, Mrs Jean Edwards, was appointed to continue the claim on behalf of his estate.
The first instance court held that the letter of 18 February 2003 and the advice given had been negligent and that had Mr Watkins received appropriate advice he would probably have rejected the offer and pursued his services claim.
A jointly instructed medical expert, who had been instructed not to apply the presumption that would have applied under the Scheme, provided a report that concluded Mr Watkinss symptoms would have been insufficient to succeed on a services claim.
The court therefore held that Mr Watkins had suffered no loss and dismissed the claim.
Mr Watkins successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, which decided that the trial judge had been wrong to determine the value of the services claim on the basis of evidence that would not have been available at the time of the notional claim.
The appellant seeks to appeal that decision.
The issue in the appeal is whether, in assessing the prospects of success of the negligence claim, the court should have taken account of the further medical report.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal and remits the matter for assessment of the value of the loss of the opportunity to pursue the services claim.
Lord Lloyd Jones gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.
In order to succeed in his claim in the tort of negligence, Mr Watkins had to establish a negligent breach of duty, causation and loss.
The trial judge found that there had been a negligent breach of duty and that causation was established.
Neither conclusion has been appealed [22].
To succeed, therefore, Mr Watkinss estate must prove loss, specifically that in losing the opportunity to pursue the claim Mr Watkins lost something of value, i.e. that his services claim had a real and substantial rather than merely a negligible prospect of success [23].
Mr Watkinss original claim was within the Scheme, and it is therefore necessary to consider whether the claim was of more than negligible value within the context of that Scheme [25].
The expert report was concerned with causation, not loss, and was prepared to assist in the assessment of whether Mr Watkinss failure to pursue a services claim arose from negligent advice or from an inability to assert truthfully that he had lost the ability to perform activities that would qualify him for a services award [27].
As a result, the expert was instructed not to apply the presumption used under the Scheme [28].
Had Mr Watkins pursued a services claim it would have proceeded on the basis of the Schemes procedures.
He would have had to undergo only a limited second medical examination and there would have been no equivalent of the experts report.
His entitlement to a services award would have been decided by the application of the Schemes presumption.
There was no justification for considering a further medical examination and report which would not have been commissioned under the Scheme and therefore the judge erred in taking this into account [29].
Given other findings in the expert report, the court is unable to accept that the services claim had no chance of success so that the lost claim was of no value [30].
The first instance judge should have proceeded to assess the value of the lost claim on a loss of opportunity basis.
The court therefore dismisses the appeal and remits the matter for that assessment [32].
"

These allegations were included by the appellant (the Council) in the schedule of matters relied upon in the care proceedings as meeting the threshold criteria for a care order under section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989.
The grandparents were joined as interveners, as were five of the six men.
The judge conducted a discrete fact finding hearing which occupied a total of five and a half weeks between February and December 2009.
The lengthy findings that he then made exonerated the grandparents and five of the other six interveners.
Four of the five men who intervened qualified for legal aid (the fifth represented himself), but the grandparents relatively modest income disentitled them from this.
The grandfather was aged 67.
He is a retired fireman.
The grandmother was aged 63 and worked, as she still does, as a part time bookkeeper.
His pension and her earnings together amount to about 25,000 a year.
The grandparents borrowed 55,000 from a building society, of which they spent 52,000 on legal advice and representation at the hearing.
They cannot hope to pay this off in less than 15 years.
In these circumstances the grandparents applied for an order that the Council pay their costs.
It was and is common ground that the Council could not be criticised for advancing in the care proceedings the allegations made against the grandparents.
The judge, His Honour Judge Dowse, summarised the basis of their application for costs as based on the apparently inequitable fact that they have largely succeeded in defending the allegations made against them but must bear their own costs.
The judge dismissed their application.
He did so on the basis that it was not usual to order costs in a child case against a party unless that partys conduct has been reprehensible or its stance unreasonable.
In support of that proposition the judge cited authorities that included the judgments of Wilson J in Sutton London Borough Council v Davis (No 2) [1994] 1 WLR 1317 and Wilson LJ in In re J (Costs of Fact Finding Hearing) [2009] EWCA Civ 1350; [2010] 1 FLR 1893.
The judge expressed the view that it was unacceptable that more and more people in the position of the grandparents were faced with potentially life changing allegations without being able to gain some financial assistance from the State.
The grandparents appealed to the Court of Appeal, consisting of Wilson and Munby LJJ and Coleridge J.
The appeal was allowed: [2010] EWCA Civ 1585.
Wilson LJ gave the leading judgment.
He held that Judge Dowse had failed to appreciate the true purport of his judgment in In re J, which was favourable rather than adverse to the grandparents application for costs.
Permission to appeal to this Court was given on terms that, whatever the result, the grandparents entitlement to recover their costs from the Council would not be disturbed.
Permission to intervene was granted to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) and to the Grandparents Association.
It is a remarkable fact, and ironic in an appeal about costs, that all counsel are appearing pro bono.
We would like to express our gratitude for the assistance that they have given.
The Family Procedure Rules 2010
On 6 April 2011 the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (SI 2010/2955) (FPR) came into force.
They apply to family proceedings in the High Court, County Courts and Magistrates Courts.
Part 28 deals with costs.
It is common ground that Part 28 of FPR consolidates the previous law relating to costs, including the relevant provisions of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 (SI 1991/1247) and that it does not change the law in relation to costs that is applicable to this appeal.
In these circumstances it is sensible to consider the issues raised by this appeal within the context of those Rules.
objective, which is defined in FPR 1.1, which provides: FPR 1.2, which is new, requires the court to give effect to the overriding 1.1 The overriding objective (1) These rules are a new procedural code with the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with cases justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved. (2) Dealing with a case justly includes, so far as is practicable (a) ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly; (b) dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues; (c) ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing; (d) saving expense; and (e) allotting to it an appropriate share of the courts resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases.
FPR 28.3 makes special provision for costs in financial remedy proceedings.
Paragraph (5) provides that the general rule in financial remedy proceedings is that the court will not make an order requiring one party to pay the costs of another party.
This is subject to paragraph (6) which permits the court to make such an order when it considers it appropriate to do so because of the conduct of a party in relation to the proceedings.
Paragraph (5) is a particular example of the departure in family proceedings from the general rule applicable in civil proceedings that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party: CPR 44.3(2)(a).
FPR 28.1 provides that The court may at any time make such order as to costs as it thinks just.
This is not an unfettered discretion, for FPR 28.2 makes applicable to family proceedings, other than financial remedy proceedings, the majority of the rules in relation to costs of the CPR.
The most significant of the rules excluded is the general rule that costs follow the event, quoted above in CPR 44.3(2).
In the context of this appeal, the most relevant of the rules that are applicable are included in the following provisions of CPR 44.3: (4) In deciding what order (if any) to make about costs, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including (a) the conduct of all the parties; (b) whether a party has succeeded on part of his case, even if he has not been wholly successful; and (c) any payment into court or admissible offer to settle made by a party which is drawn to the courts attention, and which is not an offer to which costs consequences under Part 36 apply. (5) The conduct of the parties includes (a) conduct before, as well as during, the proceedings and in particular the extent to which the parties followed the Practice Direction (Pre Action Conduct) or any relevant pre action protocol; (b) whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue; (c) the manner in which a party has pursued or defended his case or a particular allegation or issue; and (d) whether a claimant who has succeeded in his claim, in whole or in part, exaggerated his claim.
(4)(b) is relevant in relation to a regime where the general rule in (2)(a) applies.
For this reason we do not see that it has any direct relevance to family proceedings. (4)(c) can have no relevance to public law proceedings and can thus be disregarded in the present case.
The other rules are simply examples of circumstances that will be relevant when considering the result that justice requires in the individual case.
In family proceedings, however, there are usually special considerations that militate against the approach that is appropriate in other kinds of adversarial civil litigation.
This is particularly true where the interests of a child are at stake.
This explains why it is common in family proceedings, and usual in proceedings involving a child, for no order to be made in relation to costs.
The reasons for departing from the principle that costs normally follow the event differ, however, depending upon the nature of the family proceedings.
On this appeal it is necessary to identify the policy considerations that should inform the approach to costs that is required in the interests of justice in care proceedings.
Reasons for making no order for costs in family proceedings that are not relevant
in the present case
The Court has been referred to a number of authorities dealing with costs in family proceedings.
In order to see the wood from the trees it is helpful to remove from the forest the timber that does not bear on the issues raised by this appeal.
The following reasons for not awarding costs in family proceedings are not relevant: i) In ancillary relief proceedings each partys liability for costs will be taken into consideration when making the substantive award.
This approach has the advantage of discouraging the parties from running up unnecessary costs see Baker v Rowe [2009] EWCA Civ 1162; [2010] 1 FCR 413, paras 20 to 23 per Wilson LJ. iii) ii) Orders for costs between the parties will diminish the funds available to meet the needs of the family see Gojkovic v Gojkovic [1992] Fam 40, 57, per Butler Sloss LJ and R v R (Costs: Child Case) [1997] 2 FLR 95, 97, per Hale J. (This could, of course, be a good reason not to award costs against a family member in care proceedings).
It is undesirable to award costs where this will exacerbate feelings between two parents, or more generally between relations, to the ultimate detriment of the child: see B (M) v B (R) (Note) [1968] 1 WLR 1182, 1185 per Willmer LJ; Sutton London Borough Council v Davis (No 2) [1994] 1 WLR 1317, 1319 per Wilson J. (Once again this could be a good reason not to award costs against a family member).
Unreasonable conduct
CPR 44.3(5) is as relevant in care cases as it is in other kinds of family proceedings.
Where a local authority has caused costs to be incurred by acting in a way which was unreasonable justice may well require that the local authority pay the costs in question.
Examples of such cases include: In re R (Care: Disclosure: Nature of Proceedings) [2002] 1 FLR 755; In re X (Emergency Protection Orders) [2006] 2 FLR 701; Coventry City Council v X, Y and Z (Care Proceedings: Costs) [2011] 1 FLR 1045.
The principle underlying these decisions has no relevance to the present case, for it has not been suggested that the conduct of the local authority was in any respect unreasonable.
Precedent
CAFCASS have submitted that this case is the first occasion upon which a local authority has been ordered to pay costs in public law proceedings in the absence of any criticism of its conduct.
CAFCASS is well placed to make that submission and no case to the contrary has been cited to us.
In In re M (Local Authoritys Costs) [1995] 1 FLR 533 a local authority applied for permission to refuse contact between two children and their parents.
The magistrates refused the application and ordered the local authority to pay the fathers costs.
On appeal Cazalet J set aside that order, holding that there should be no order as to costs.
Citing the decision of Wilson J in Sutton London Borough Council v Davis he observed at p 541 that it would be unusual for a court to make an order for costs in a child case where a partys conduct had not been reprehensible or that partys stance had not been beyond the band of what was reasonable.
He added at p 544: As a matter of public policy it seems to me that where there is the exercise of [a] nicely balanced judgment to be made by a local authority carrying out its statutory duties, the local authority should not feel that it is liable to be condemned in costs if, despite acting within the band of reasonableness (to adopt the words of Wilson J), it may form a different view to that which a court may ultimately adopt.
The reasoning of the Court of Appeal
The chain of reasoning of Wilson LJ in this case has its origin in his decision in Sutton London Borough Council v Davis.
The local authority had refused to register a childminder, who successfully appealed to the magistrates, who awarded costs in her favour.
The local authority appealed against the costs order.
In doing so the authority urged the court to apply, by analogy, the principle that costs are not usually ordered in child cases.
Wilson J accepted that this was a proposition applied for many years in the Family Division.
He gave the following explanation for that proposition at p 1319: Where the debate surrounds the future of a child, the proceedings are partly inquisitorial and the aspiration is that in their outcome the child is the winner and indeed the only winner.
The court does not wish the spectre of an order for costs to discourage those with a proper interest in the child from participating in the debate.
Nor does it wish to reduce the chance of their co operation around the future life of the child by casting one as the successful party entitled to his costs and another as the unsuccessful party obliged to pay them.
The proposition applies in its fullest form to proceedings between parents and other relations; but it also applies to proceedings to which a local authority are a party.
Thus, even when a local authoritys application for a care order is dismissed, it is unusual to order them to pay the costs of the other parties.
But the proposition is not applied where, for example, the conduct of a party has been reprehensible or the partys stance has been beyond the band of what is reasonable: Havering London Borough Council v S [1986] 1 FLR 489 and Gojkovic v Gojkovic [1992] Fam 40, 60C D.
Wilson J then dealt with the facts.
He observed that the local authority had erred in concluding that the respondent was not fit to mind children, but held that their stance in relation to Mrs Davis was neither reprehensible nor unreasonable.
Wilson J went on to reject the analogy with care proceedings, and dismissed the appeal.
His reasons at pp 1319 1320 were as follows: In care proceedings the local authority and all other parties come into court in order to assist it in choosing the programme for the childs future which will best serve his or her welfare.
In the case of Mrs Davis the local authority made an incorrect decision as to her fitness.
She had a right to be registered and they infringed it.
Mrs Davis afforded them the opportunity to review their decision by lodging an objection pursuant to section 77(3) of the Children Act 1989.
But they resolved that the decision should stand.
In order to establish her right to be registered, Mrs Davis had to appeal to the magistrates court.
The proceedings were adversarial and the local authority lost the argument.
Such were the circumstances for application of the principle that costs should follow the event.
Far from being satisfied that the justices were plainly wrong to decide that the local authority should pay the costs of Mrs Davis, I consider that they were right.
This judgment confirmed that it was not the normal practice to award costs in child care cases.
It contained, however, the seeds of what was to follow, for in effect Wilson J applied the general common law rule that costs follow the event in adversarial cases.
In re J (Children) [2009] EWCA Civ 1350 involved contact proceedings between a mother and father.
The district judge held a fact finding hearing to resolve allegations of violence made by the mother and denied by the father.
Most of the mothers allegations were held to be established and she sought the costs of the hearing.
The district judge refused her application and made no order as to costs.
The mother appealed to the county court.
She invited the judge to draw a distinction between the fact finding hearing and that part of the hearing that related to the welfare of the children.
The judge declined to do so.
He held that the father had not acted unreasonably in giving evidence in opposition to the mother and dismissed her appeal.
On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Wilson LJ, giving the only reasoned judgment, held that the circuit judge had been wrong not to adopt a compartmentalised approach.
He held at para 17: The order for a bespoke fact finding hearing was surely to consign the determination of the mother's allegations into a separate compartment of the court's determination of the father's application for an order for contact.
It went almost without saying, although the circuit judge chose to say it, that the optimum outcome of the contact application could be determined only by reference to the findings made at the fact finding hearing; but the effect of the direction for a separate fact finding hearing was that the costs incurred by the mother in relation to that hearing can confidently be seen to be wholly referable to her allegations against the father.
There was, in that sense, a ring fence around that hearing and thus around the costs referable to it.
Those costs did not relate to the paradigm situation to which the general proposition in favour of no order as to costs applies.
Wilson LJ went on to hold that the husband had not acted irrationally and that a proper exercise of the courts discretion did not depend upon why he chose to deny allegations that he must have known were true.
He remarked that issues of fact arose in most disputed cases in relation to children and that his decision in the instant case should not be taken as an indication that it was appropriate to make an order for costs in the vast run of such cases.
He held, however, that the mothers case fell into a separate and unusual category.
It was devoted exclusively to consideration of the serious and relevant allegations made by the mother against the father, most of which were established.
In these circumstances he held that the proper order was for the father to pay two thirds of the mothers costs of the hearing.
This decision could have been justified on the ground that the costs in question had been caused by the fathers unreasonable refusal to admit the facts that were ultimately proved against him, but Wilson LJs reasoning appears to have been simply that a party who makes allegations of fact against another party that prove to be unfounded, or who challenges allegations of fact that prove to be well founded, should be liable for the costs of resolving those issues, whether his conduct was reasonable or not.
We turn to the decision of Wilson LJ in the present case.
He held that Judge Dowse had erred in relying upon In re J to justify applying the general proposition that no order for costs should be made in a child case.
He had failed to appreciate that the true purport of In re J was that the general proposition should not be applied in relation to the costs of a fact finding hearing.
Wilson LJ rejected the submission made on behalf of the Council that the general proposition against awarding costs in care proceedings applied.
He held at para 18: I consider that, where in care proceedings a local authority raise, however appropriately, very serious factual allegations against a parent or other party and at the end of a fact finding hearing the judge concludes that they have not established them, the general proposition is not in play.
In that situation he held that the judge should approach the question of costs with a clean sheet.
As to the approach that the judge should then follow, Wilson LJ cited at para 20 the statement that he had made in ancillary relief proceedings that were not concerned with a child, Baker v Rowe [2010] 1 FCR 413, para 25: Even where the judge starts with a clean sheet, the fact that one party has been unsuccessful, and must therefore usually be regarded as responsible for the generation of the successful partys costs, will often properly count as the decisive factor in the exercise of the judges discretion.
He added at para 21: In my view the facts that the grandparents were faced with allegations of the utmost severity, that accordingly it had been reasonable for them to stretch their economy to the utmost in order to secure for themselves a professional defence against them and that in the event the result was an exoneration, were all matters which should have been of great, indeed in my view of decisive, importance to a judge who was about to write on a clean sheet.
The relevance of a split hearing
Care proceedings usually involve allegations of misconduct by some person, typically a parent who is looking after the child, but often, as in this case, of other persons.
Those against whom allegations are made are likely to wish to challenge them.
The parents primary concern may be not to lose care of the child.
Others may simply be concerned to clear their names.
The object of the proceedings is to reach the decision that is in the best interests of the child.
The procedure for achieving this in this jurisdiction is adversarial.
The proceedings are brought by the local authority.
The parents and the child or children concerned are made respondents.
Those against whom allegations of misconduct are made may be joined, either on their own application or at the initiative of the court, as interveners.
Before deciding what is in the best interests of the child it is sometimes necessary to resolve issues of fact.
The court will normally require the local authority to set out the findings of fact that it seeks to establish in order to show that the threshold requirements for making a care order laid down by section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989 are satisfied.
The decision to have a split hearing of care proceedings is essentially one of case management.
It is taken by the court.
The position was clearly spelt out by Lady Hale in In re B (Children)(Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) (CAFCASS intervening) [2008] UKHL 35; [2009] AC 11: 74.
Care proceedings are not a two stage process.
The court does have two questions to ask.
Has the threshold been crossed? If so, what will be best for the child? But there are many cases in which a court has two or more questions to ask in the course of a single hearing.
The same factual issues are often relevant to each question.
Or some factual disputes may be relevant to the threshold while others are relevant to the welfare checklist: it may be clear, for example, that a child has suffered an injury while in the care of the mother, but whether the father or stepfather has a drink problem and has been beating the mother up is extremely relevant to the long term welfare of the child. 75.
The purpose of splitting the hearing is not to split the two questions which the court must answer.
It is to separate out those factual issues which are capable of swift resolution so that the welfare professionals have a firm foundation of fact upon which to base their assessments of family relationships and parenting ability: see In re S (Care Proceedings: Split Hearing) [1996] 2 FLR 773.
A fact finding hearing is merely one of the case management possibilities contemplated by the new Public Law Outline There is no point in splitting the issues if the facts cannot be determined relatively quickly, still less if it is unlikely to result in clear cut findings to help the professionals in their work. 76.
But the finding of those facts is merely part of the whole process of trying the case.
It is not a separate exercise.
And once it is done
the case is part heard
The decision to have a split hearing cannot affect the principles to be applied by the court when dealing with costs, although it may have a practical impact on the courts decision.
The first part of a split hearing isolates specific issues of fact.
For the local authority and the court the resolution of those issues is a stepping stone to the final decision in relation to the welfare of the child or children concerned.
So far as interveners are concerned, their interests in the proceedings may be restricted to the findings that are made at the first hearing.
Having a split hearing makes it much easier to identify both the manner in which the issues of fact have been resolved and the costs reasonably incurred by the parties in relation to the issues affecting them.
It follows that, if it is correct in principle to award costs in relation to individual issues of fact, this can much more readily be done where there has been a split hearing.
Indeed the exercise may well be one that it is not practical, and therefore not desirable, to undertake where there has not been a split hearing.
Courts are, however, accustomed to making a special award of costs in relation to a discrete issue that forms part of a single hearing.
This appeal raises an issue of principle in relation to that practice in the context of care proceedings.
The issue of principle
The issue of principle raised by this appeal is whether in care proceedings a local authority should be liable to pay an interveners reasonable costs in relation to allegations of fact, reasonably made by the authority against the intervener, which have been held by the court to be unfounded.
The principle advanced by Cazalet J that I have quoted at para 14 has continued to be applied in cases not involving split hearings subsequent to the decision in In re J.
Thus in Coventry City Council v X, Y and Z (Care Proceedings: Costs) [2011] 1 FLR 1045 at para 192 His Honour Judge Bellamy ruled that it was still an appropriate test to apply.
In Kent County Council v Mother and others [2011] EWHC 1267 (Fam) Baker J rejected an application for costs against a local authority by an intervener who had been wholly exonerated in a fact finding hearing that was the first part of a split hearing.
He did so on the ground that the impetus for making the allegations against the intervener had been that of the court not the local authority.
The principle applied by Cazalet J appears to mirror the approach in proceedings under the Court of Protection Rules 2007 (SI) 2007/1744).
Rule 157 provides that where proceedings concern a protected persons welfare the general rule is that there will be no order as to the costs of the proceedings or of that part of the proceedings that concern his personal welfare.
Rule 159 permits departure from the general rule if the circumstances so justify.
In G v E and Manchester City Council and F [2010] EWHC 3385 (Fam) Baker J awarded costs against a local authority that had been guilty of misconduct that he held justified departure from the general rule.
He observed at para 40: Parties should be free to bring personal welfare issues to the Court of Protection without fear of a costs sanction.
Local authorities and others who carry out their work professionally have no reason to fear that a costs order will be made.
It is only local authorities who break the law, or who are guilty of misconduct that falls within the meaning of rule 159, that have reason to fear a costs order.
Local authorities who do their job properly and abide by the law have nothing to fear.
These comments were endorsed on appeal by Hooper LJ: [2011] EWCA Civ 939, at para 17.
The statement of principle of Wilson LJ that we have quoted at para 23 above is at odds with the principle applied by Cazalet J and the judges who have followed him, giving rise to the issue that we have set out at para 29.
Should local authorities be protected from liability to costs in care cases?
The duties imposed on local authorities often require them to initiate public law proceedings.
The Court of Appeal has recently considered, in the context of cases where claims are conceded, whether different principles apply in the case of public authorities in proceedings in the Administrative Court.
The court held that the position should be no different for litigation in the Administrative Court from what it is in general civil litigation see M v Croydon London Borough Council [2012] EWCA Civ 595.
There is no general principle that protects a local authority that has acted reasonably in the course of its duties from liability for costs in public law proceedings.
Are there special considerations that apply in family proceedings involving children?
At para 12 we have identified a number of circumstances in which there is good reason for not applying the general rule that costs follow the event to family proceedings.
They are all circumstances in which orders for costs might have consequences that conflicted with the object of the individual proceedings.
They have no application to the position of a local authority that has caused costs to be incurred by making allegations that have proved to be unfounded.
Submissions
Miss Bazley QC for the Council advanced a broad argument of policy in support of the Councils appeal.
Local authorities have limited funds.
Their costs in relation to care proceedings are met from their Childrens Services budgets.
There are many other claims on this budget.
Miss Bazley submitted that if local authorities are to be at risk of paying the costs of those against whom they reasonably make allegations in care proceedings, this is likely to inhibit them from doing so, to the general detriment of children at risk.
More generally, the child services provided would suffer as a result of this additional financial burden.
Miss Bazley produced in support of her submissions the results of what might be described as an amateur survey carried out by junior counsel and Bar students into the attitudes of 28 local authorities to the risk of liability to costs in care cases.
Although no objection was made to this material, we do not consider that it would be appropriate to base conclusions upon it.
No evidence is needed, however, to support the proposition that if local authorities are to become liable to pay the costs of those that they properly involve in care proceedings this is going to impact on their finances and the activities to which these are directed.
The Court can also take judicial notice of the fact that local authorities are financially hard pressed, as demonstrated by the fact that their counsel have appeared before us without payment.
Miss Bazleys submissions were supported by CAFCASS.
They made the further point that if costs are to be awarded against local authorities who fail to make good allegations reasonably made, costs are likely to be awarded against interveners who are held wrongfully to have challenged allegations made against them, which is likely to result in a reluctance to intervene, to the detriment of the conduct of care cases.
Although the Grandparents are no longer at risk, Mr Hirst who appeared for them, advanced their case with vigour.
He accepted that there was a general principle that costs should not be awarded in cases involving children, but argued that Wilson LJ had been correct not to apply this principle to fact finding hearings.
Interveners in such hearings would be concerned principally in clearing their names.
The issue was not what was in the best interests of the child but whether the facts alleged by the local authority were true.
Local authorities who failed on that issue should, in justice, pay the interveners costs.
Mr Hale, who appeared for the Grandparents Association, did not put the distinction between a single hearing and a split hearing at the forefront of his argument and, indeed, some parts of his written case did not support that distinction.
Thus he submitted at para 47 that whether the fact finding was listed separately or together with the welfare determination made no discernable difference and at para 48 that not every fact finding hearing would lead to an order for costs.
All other factors and considerations were in play.
Mr Hale focussed primarily on general considerations of policy.
He submitted that there was no reason of public policy for treating local authorities differently from other parties in public law proceedings.
The suggestion that potential liability to costs would fetter their performance of their public duties was anecdotal and unjustified.
Justice would best be served by giving the court an unfettered discretion in relation to costs.
In a case such as the present it would be an affront to natural justice to leave the interveners to pay their own costs.
Discussion
The question of whether it is just to make an award of costs against a public authority must be distinguished from the question of whether a litigants costs should be publicly funded.
The former question is for the court; the latter for the legislature.
Whether a litigants costs should be publicly funded involves issues in relation to access to justice and the requirements of article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
Mr Hale invoked that article in support of his argument that where allegations made against an intervener are not made out, the local authority which advanced those allegations should be liable for the interveners costs.
We consider that this argument was misconceived.
The requirements to provide public funding in the interests of access to justice and of compliance with article 6 apply at the outset of legal proceedings, not when they are concluded, in the light of the result.
The Funding Code prepared by the Legal Services Commission pursuant to section 8 of the Access to Justice Act 1999 makes provision for public funding in proceedings under, inter alia, section 31 of the Children Act 1989.
The effect of the code is that children, parents and those with parental responsibility are granted funding without reference to means, prospects of success or reasonableness, but such funding is not available to interveners who are joined in such proceedings: see volume 3C 427 of the Legal Services Commission Manual.
There may be a case for saying that this results in injustice in the case of interveners in the position of the grandparents in the present case, but it does not follow that justice demands that any deficiency in the provision of legal aid funding should be made up out of the funds of the local authority responsible for the care proceedings.
If in principle a local authority should be liable for the costs of interveners against whom allegations have been reasonably made that are held unfounded, then this liability should arise whether or not the interveners are publicly funded.
In the present case, the five men who intervened and were exonerated should also have sought and been awarded costs.
The burden of costs awarded against local authorities in such circumstances is likely to be considerable.
When considering whether it is just to make an award of costs against a local authority in circumstances such as those of the present case it is legitimate to have regard to the competing demands on the limited funds of the local authority.
In the context of care proceedings it is not right to treat a local authority as in the same position as a civil litigant who raises an issue that is ultimately determined against him.
The Children Act 1989 imposes duties on the local authority in respect of the care of children.
If the local authority receives information that a child has been subjected to or is likely to be subjected to serious harm it has a duty to investigate the report and, where there are reasonable grounds for believing that it may be well founded, to instigate care proceedings.
In this respect the role of a local authority has much in common with the role of a prosecuting authority in criminal proceedings.
It is for the court, and not the local authority, to decide whether the allegations are well founded.
It is a serious misfortune to be the subject of unjustified allegations in relation to misconduct to a child, but where it is reasonable that these should be investigated by a court, justice does not demand that the local authority responsible for placing the allegations before the court should ultimately be responsible for the legal costs of the person against whom the allegations are made.
Since the Children Act came into force, care proceedings have proceeded on the basis that costs will not be awarded against local authorities where no criticism can be made of the manner in which they have performed their duties under the Act.
Wilson LJ in In re J at para 19 disclaimed any suggestion that it was appropriate in the vast run of these cases to make an order for costs in whole or in part by reference to the courts determination of issues of historical fact.
But, as I have indicated, there is no valid basis for restricting his approach in that case to findings in a split hearing.
The principle that he applied would open the door to successful costs applications against local authorities in respect of many determinations of issues of historical fact.
The effect on the resources of local authorities, and the uses to which those resources are put would be significant.
For these reasons we have concluded that the general practice of not awarding costs against a party, including a local authority, in the absence of reprehensible behaviour or an unreasonable stance, is one that accords with the ends of justice and which should not be subject to an exception in the case of split hearings.
Judge Dowses costs order was founded on this practice.
It was sound in principle and should not have been reversed by the Court of Appeal.
Accordingly we allow this appeal and restore Judge Dowses order, on the basis that it shall not be relied upon to deprive the grandparents of the costs to which the Court of Appeal held that they were entitled.
","This appeal concerns the liability of a local authority to pay the costs of a party to care proceedings.
The proceedings related to two children, whose parents were separated.
The local authority applied for a care order under section 31 (2) Children Act 1989 in response to the making of allegations by the children that they had suffered sexual abuse by their father and six other men, in which the fathers parents (the grandparents) had colluded.
The six men and the grandparents were joined to the care proceedings as interveners.
The judge conducted a lengthy fact finding hearing, as a result of which he exonerated five of the six men and the grandparents of any such abuse.
The interveners were entitled to be represented at the hearing.
The six men qualified for legal aid but the grandparents did not.
They incurred costs of 52,000, which they met by taking out a mortgage on their house.
At the end of the hearing they applied for an order that the local authority should pay their costs on the ground that they had succeeded in defending the allegations made against them.
It was accepted that the local authority had acted reasonably in bringing the proceedings.
The judge refused their application on the basis that it was not usual to order costs in a child case against a party unless that partys conduct had been unreasonable or reprehensible.
The Court of Appeal allowed the grandparents appeal, holding that costs could be awarded in respect of discrete fact finding hearings.
Although it rarely hears appeals relating solely to costs, the Supreme Court granted permission to appeal because of the important point of principle raised by the appeal, on terms that, whatever the result, the grandparents entitlement to recover their costs as a result of the order of the Court of Appeal would not be disturbed.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
It holds that the general practice of not awarding costs in care proceedings against a party, including a local authority, in the absence of reprehensible behaviour or an unreasonable stance, should not be subject to an exception in the case of discrete fact finding hearings.
Lord Phillips delivers the judgment of the court.
Family proceedings depart from the general rule applicable in civil proceedings that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party (CPR 44.3(2)(a)).
This is because there are special considerations that militate against the approach appropriate in other kinds of adversarial litigation, particularly where the interests of children are at stake.
It is usual in proceedings involving a child for no order to be made in relation to costs [11].
Care proceedings usually involve allegations of misconduct towards a child by some persons, typically a parent.
The object of the proceedings is to reach a decision which is in the best interests of the child.
Often it is necessary to resolve issues of fact which are disputed.
The decision whether or not to have a split hearing is one of case management, taken by the court, and cannot affect the principles to be applied by the court when dealing with costs.
If it is correct in a particular case to award costs in relation to individual issues of fact this can more easily be done if the costs associated with those issues are incurred in a separate hearing, but this is only relevant to the practicality of such an order [28].
The question of whether it was just to make an award of costs against a public authority had to be distinguished from the question of whether a litigants costs should be publicly funded, which was a matter for Parliament [39].
The current arrangements might lead to injustice for interveners in the position of the grandparents in the present case, but it did not follow that justice demanded that any deficiency in the provision of public funding should be made up from the funds of the local authority responsible for care proceedings [40].
Equally, if in principle a local authority should be liable for the costs of interveners who succeed in showing that factual allegations against them are unfounded, this liability should arise whether or not the interveners are publicly funded [41].
It was legitimate to have regard to the competing demands on the limited funds of the local authority.
It was not right to treat it as in the same position as a civil litigant who raises an issue that is ultimately determined against him.
A local authority has a duty to investigate reports that a child has been subjected to significant harm and, where there are reasonable grounds for believing that they may be well founded, to instigate care proceedings.
In this respect the role of the local authority has much in common with that of a prosecuting authority and it is for the court to determine where the truth lies [42].
There was no valid basis for restricting the approach of the Court of Appeal in this case to findings of fact in a split hearing and the effect on the resources of local authorities would be significant [43].
For these reasons the Supreme Court concluded that that the general practice of not awarding costs in care proceedings against a party, including a local authority, in the absence of reprehensible behaviour or an unreasonable stance, is one that accords with the ends of justice and which should not be subject to an exception in the case of split hearings [44].
"
uksc-2011-0046,"Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, women (or men) whose work is of equal value to that of men (or women) in the same employment are entitled to the benefit of a deemed equality clause in their contracts of employment.
This means that if any of their terms and conditions is less favourable than the equivalent term or condition of the men with whom they are compared, they are entitled to have the benefit of that more favourable term, as if it had been included in their original contract of employment.
It is therefore necessary to identify the precise terms and conditions with which comparison is to be made.
This entails finding an individual or group of the opposite sex who constitute a valid comparator.
There are several elements in that task.
One involves looking at the kind of work the men and the women do: is it like, or has it been rated as equivalent, or is it of equal value? Another involves looking to see whether there are material factors other than the difference in sex which explain the difference in treatment.
But a threshold question is whether the men and women are in the same employment.
The issue in this case is what that means.
The answer would be easy if all it meant was that they were employed by the same employer, the person with whom they all have contracts of employment and who therefore has it within his power to correct the inequality.
Unfortunately, it is not that simple.
There are occasions when women may be able to compare themselves with men who are not employed by the same employer.
However, in United Kingdom law, there are also occasions when women may not be able to compare themselves with men, even though they are employed by the same employer, because they are not employed at the same establishment.
But if that provision erects a barrier to a claim which would otherwise be available under European Union law, it would be our duty to disapply it.
Section 1(6) of the Equal Pay Act 1970 provides:
. men shall be treated as in the same employment with a woman if they are men employed by her employer or any associated employer at the same establishment or at establishments in Great Britain which include that one and at which common terms and conditions of employment are observed either generally or for employees of the relevant classes. (emphasis supplied) The Equal Pay Act 1970 has now been repealed and replaced by provisions in the Equality Act 2010 which are intended to be of equivalent effect, but the 1970 Act continues to govern claims, such as those in the present case, which were brought before the 2010 Act came into force.
The case law so far
Section 1(6) falls into two separate propositions, one contained in the words before and the other contained in the words after or where it appears for the second time in the subsection.
The first proposition is straightforward: if the woman and her comparator are employed by the same or an associated employer in the same establishment, then they are in the same employment and there is no need to consider the question of common terms of employment: see Lawson v Britfish Ltd [1987] ICR 726; North Cumbria Acute Hospitals NHS Trust v Potter [2009] IRLR 176.
The difficulty comes with the second proposition, where they are employed at establishments in Great Britain which include that one and at which common terms and conditions of employment are observed either generally or for employees of the relevant classes.
The interpretation of this proposition has come before the House of Lords on two previous occasions and we have not been invited to depart from the conclusions they reached.
In Leverton v Clwyd County Council [1989] AC 709, the applicant was a nursery nurse who wished to compare herself with male clerical workers employed by the same local authority under terms and conditions derived from the same collective agreement, known as the Purple Book.
None of the male workers worked at the same establishment as she did and their hours of work were longer and their holidays shorter than those of the applicant.
The employment tribunal, the Employment Appeal Tribunal, and the Court of Appeal (by a majority) held that they were not in the same employment for the purpose of section 1(6).
They took the view that the subsection called for a comparison between the terms and conditions of the applicant and of her comparators and that only if those were broadly similar to one another was the test satisfied.
The House of Lords disagreed.
Lord Bridge of Harwich gave the leading opinion, with which the other members of the appellate committee agreed.
He thought that the language of the subsection was clear and unambiguous: The concept of common terms and conditions of employment observed generally at different establishments necessarily contemplates terms and conditions applicable to a wide range of employees whose individual terms will vary greatly inter se (p 745F).
Terms and conditions governed by the same collective agreement seemed to him the paradigm, though not necessarily the only example, of common terms and conditions contemplated by the subsection.
But if there was any ambiguity, he would reject a construction which required a broad similarity between the terms and conditions of the woman and of her claimed comparators.
Such a construction: frustrates rather than serves the manifest purpose of the legislation.
That purpose is to enable a woman to eliminate discriminatory differences between the terms of her contract and those of any male fellow employee doing like work, work rated as equivalent or work of equal value, whether he works in the same establishment as her or in another establishment where terms and conditions of employment common to both establishments are observed (pp 745H 746A).
It could not have been the intention of Parliament to require a woman to prove an undefined substratum of similarity between her terms of employment and his as the basis of a claim to eliminate any discriminatory difference between them.
In his view, the reason why Parliament had not simply required that the
woman and her comparators be employed by the same employer but had also required that common terms and conditions of employment be observed between two different establishments was that a single employer might operate essentially different employment regimes at different establishments (p 746C).
He gave the examples of one employer having establishments in London and in Newcastle, where the regimes were quite different, or of a company operating one factory taking over a company operating another factory, where there were quite different collective agreements resulting in quite different structures.
Leverton was an easy case, because everyone was employed under the same Purple Book agreement.
But once it is clear that Parliament cannot have been referring to common, or even broadly similar, terms and conditions between the woman and her comparators, it is equally clear that it cannot be a requirement that they are covered by the same collective agreement.
In British Coal Corporation v Smith [1996] ICR 515, the applicants were canteen workers, canteen manageresses and cleaners, employed at 47 different British Coal Corporation establishments.
Their named comparators were mainly surface mineworkers working at 14 different establishments, some of them the same as the places where the women worked and some of them not.
Their terms and conditions were governed by a variety of agreements.
It was not disputed that the women could take a comparator from their own colliery or other workplace.
The question was whether they could take comparators from other collieries or workplaces.
Lord Slynn of Hadley, with whose opinion all the other members of the appellate committee agreed, pointed out that it was obvious why a woman was not limited to comparing herself with men employed in the same workplace as she was: . otherwise an employer could so arrange things as to ensure that only women worked at a particular establishment or that no man who could reasonably be considered as a possible comparator should work there (p 525H).
The inclusion in section 1(6) of the words which include that one (that is, the establishment at which the woman works) was at first sight puzzling, but read with the words and at which common terms . are observed which follow it simply meant that common terms must be observed, not only at the other place but also at the womans place of work if employees of the relevant class were employed there.
It was agreed that the woman did not have to show that she shared common terms and conditions with her comparator, either in relation to those terms which were alleged to constitute the discrimination or in relation to the other terms.
What had to be shown was that the different classes of employee shared common terms.
It was agreed that the women did so.
Hence: What therefore has to be shown is that the male comparators at other establishments and at her establishment share common terms and conditions.
If there are no such men at the claimants place of work then it has to be shown that like terms and conditions would apply if men were employed there in the particular jobs concerned (p 526F).
The Corporation claimed that this meant that the terms and conditions of the comparators had to be the same in substantially all respects.
Lord Slynn rejected this and adopted a test of broad similarity: The purpose of requiring common terms and conditions was to avoid it being said simply a gardener does work of equal value to mine and my comparator at another establishment is a gardener.
It was necessary for the applicant to go further and to show that gardeners at other establishments and at her establishment were or would be employed on broadly similar terms.
It was necessary but it was also sufficient (p 527D).
The principles to be derived from these two cases are therefore plain.
First, the common terms and conditions referred to in section 1(6) are not those of, on the one hand, the women applicants and, on the other hand, their claimed comparators.
They are, on the one hand, the terms and conditions under which the male comparators are employed at different establishments from the women and, on the other hand, the terms and conditions under which those male comparators are or would be employed if they were employed at the same establishment as the women.
Second, by common terms and conditions the subsection is not looking for complete correspondence between what those terms are, or would be, in the womans place of work.
It is enough that they are, or would be, broadly similar.
It is also plain from the reasoning of both Lord Bridge in Leverton and Lord Slynn in British Coal Corporation that it is no answer to say that no such male comparators ever would be employed, on those or any other terms, at the same establishment as the women.
Otherwise, it would be far too easy for an employer so to arrange things that only men worked in one place and only women in another.
This point is of particular importance, now that women are entitled to claim equality with men who are doing completely different jobs, provided that the women are doing jobs of equal value.
Those completely different jobs may well be done in completely different places from the jobs which the women are doing.
However, it is fair to say that it is not clear from the facts as we have them that this was the actual situation in the British Coal Corporation case.
Some of the male surface mine workers were working in the same colliery as some of the claimants.
It could just be, as suggested by Mr Truscott QC on behalf of the employers in this case, that all the 47 places where the women worked were collieries at which it was possible that surface mineworkers might also work, even though those chosen do not in fact do so.
The issue, therefore, is whether the women can compare themselves with men employed by the same employer in other places of work when in practice those men would never be employed to do their current jobs in the same place as the women.
The facts
These claims are brought by 251 classroom assistants, support for learning assistants and nursery nurses employed in a local authoritys schools.
The classroom and support for learning assistants are employed in the local authoritys education service under the terms contained in a national collective agreement, the Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical agreement, known as the Blue Book.
The nursery nurses are employed under a supplement to the Blue Book.
They are based at a variety of schools in the local authoritys area.
Their individual contracts specify the particular school at which they are based and also state that they may be required to work at other locations.
They are employed during the school terms only and work less than 35 hours per week.
The convenience of these hours for people with child care or other domestic responsibilities is no doubt one of the reasons why these posts are predominantly held by women.
The claimants wish to compare themselves with a variety of manual workers employed by the same local authority, as groundsmen, refuse collectors, refuse drivers and a leisure attendant.
They are employed in the authoritys combined services, under a different collective agreement, the Scottish Council for Local Authorities Services (Manual Workers) Scheme of Pay and Conditions of Service, known as the Green Book.
The leisure attendant is based at a swimming pool, but the others are based at various depots in the local authoritys area, from which they go out to do their work in a variety of locations.
Although some of their work is done at schools, they are not based there.
Their individual contracts of employment specify the depot at which they are based and that they may be required to work at other locations.
They work full time with a fixed annual leave entitlement.
They are entitled to substantial bonus payments or supplements on top of their basic pay, whereas the claimants are not.
The authority does employ a small number of manual workers as school janitors.
They are based in schools and, like the claimants, work only during the school terms.
But the claimants do not wish to compare themselves with the janitors, who are not entitled to the bonuses or supplements which the other manual workers enjoy.
It may be worth noting that the employers and trade unions have negotiated a single status collective agreement, known as the Red Book, which would cover both the claimants and the comparators.
But the existing pay and grading arrangements were to remain in force until the employers had completed a job evaluation exercise.
This had not been done at the time of the employment tribunals decision in this case, so the essential terms remained governed by the original Blue and Green Books.
The proceedings
Most of the claims were lodged between February and December 2006, with the last claim lodged in February 2007.
As none of the claimants was employed at the same establishment as their chosen comparators, the local authority applied for a pre hearing review to have the employment tribunal determine whether or not they were in the same employment as defined in section 1(6) of the 1970 Act.
The claims were conjoined by order at the outset of the pre hearing review in December 2007.
This is but the first hurdle which the claimants face.
If they succeed in jumping it, they will still have to prove that their work is comparable to that of the men.
In its original form, the 1970 Act only imposed an equality clause where they were employed in like work (now covered by section 1(2)(a)) or work rated as equivalent in a formal job evaluation exercise (now covered by section 1(2)(b)).
Although both are mentioned in the sample claim form which we have seen, these claims are primarily based on the allegation that the work done by the claimants is of equal value to that done by the comparators.
Section 1(2)(c) of the 1970 Act (added by SI 1983/1794) applies where a woman is employed on work which, not being work in relation to which paragraph (a) or (b) above applies, is, in terms of the demands made on her (for instance under such headings as effort, skill and decision), of equal value to that of a man in the same employment.
That issue has yet to be addressed.
Furthermore, if the claimants succeed in establishing that their work is of equal value, the employer could still seek to establish that there was a good reason for the difference between their terms and conditions.
Section 1(3) of the 1970 Act (as substituted by SI 1983/1794) provides: An equality clause . shall not operate in relation to a variation between the womans contract and the mans contract if the employer proves that the variation is genuinely due to a material factor which is not the difference of sex and that factor (a) in the case of an equality clause falling within subsection (2)(a) or (b) above, must be a material difference between the womans case and the mans; and (b) in the case of an equality clause falling within subsection (2)(c) above, may be such a material difference.
This issue, too, has yet to be addressed.
Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that the question of whether there are other explanations for the difference in treatment is analytically quite distinct from the question whether the claimants and their comparators are in the same employment within the meaning of section 1(6).
So too is the question of what modifications to the womens terms and conditions would be necessary to eliminate the less favourable treatment.
At times during the argument at all levels in this case, it appears that those distinctions have not been observed.
In May 2008, the employment tribunal determined the same employment issue in the claimants favour.
The employment judge defined the question in this way, at para 61: In the present case, the claimants and comparators are neither employed under the same terms and conditions nor in the same establishment.
It is therefore necessary for the claimants to satisfy the Tribunal that if their comparators were employed at their establishment, they would be employed under broadly similar terms to those that they are employed under at present.
That, as the Court of Session later acknowledged, was exactly the right question.
The judge answered that question in the affirmative.
It was not enough for the respondents to say that the comparators would never be employed at the same establishment.
They did some of their work at schools, there was no suggestion that this work was of less significance than the work they did elsewhere, and when they did work at schools there was no change to their terms and conditions of employment.
There was no persuasive evidence before the Tribunal that in the event they were based at the same establishment as the claimants, the comparators would be employed under terms and conditions other than the Green Book (para 61 bis).
The judge did not at that stage specifically refer to the evidence which had been given for the local authority on which that statement was based (excerpted at para 27 below), although she had earlier referred to some of it when reciting the submissions of the parties.
The local authority appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, which handed down judgment allowing the appeal in May 2009: UKEATS/47/08, [2009] ICR 1363.
Lady Smith accepted the respondents argument that a woman who seeks to compare her terms and conditions with those of a man who does not work at the same establishment as she does must first show that there is a real possibility that he could be employed there to do the same or a broadly similar job to the one which he does at the other establishment.
Such a finding was not open to the Tribunal on the evidence.
The claimants then appealed to the Court of Session.
Before their appeal was heard, the EAT decided the case of City of Edinburgh Council v Wilkinson [2010] IRLR 756.
The women claimants were employed by the council on Blue Book terms in a variety of posts in schools, hostels, libraries or social work.
They wished to compare themselves with manual workers, including road workers, refuse collectors, gardeners and grave diggers, employed on Green Book terms.
Lady Smith (having revisited the House of Lords authorities discussed above) accepted that the intention of section 1(6) could be undermined if claimants were required to establish, as fact, that there was a real possibility of their comparators being employed at the same establishments as them.
It was enough to show that it is likely that those comparators would, wherever they worked, always be employed on the same terms and conditions.
If they were always employed on the same terms and conditions, it was legitimate to assume that they would be employed on those terms and conditions at the claimants establishment and men and women would thus be shown to be in the same employment (para 77).
The paradigm example of the required hypothetical exercise would be where the comparators were always employed under the same collective agreement, as in that case.
When the present case came before the Court of Session, in January 2011, that court agreed with Lady Smiths rejection of the real possibility test in Wilkinson: [2011] CSIH 2, 2011 SLT 203.
Nevertheless, Lady Paton (delivering the opinion of the court) held that the evidence did not support the employment tribunals factual conclusion.
She quoted several paragraphs from the evidence of Mr Archibald, for the local authority, at para 35 of her judgment, which included the following: If a manual worker comparator were for any reason to transfer to do their job solely and only in a school context, which would seem an impossible suggestion, then I cannot envisage other than that they would retain core Green Book conditions, but because of the nature of the work undertaken across all educational establishments, their terms and conditions would require to be very significantly varied to make working in such locations possible (para 32).
In her view, that passage was concerned with a worker who was transferred to do most of his work at a school but remained based at his depot.
Later passages in Mr Archibalds evidence hypothesised a manual worker based at a school: Conceivably some new, hybrid, handyperson type job incorporating all the tasks of the comparators could be created but as to what the terms of such a job would be would be difficult to assess if it was to remain on Manual Worker terms, because of the job content then the Green Book terms any such postholder would be on (whether doing a hybrid job or his/her current job) would not be similar to those s/he currently enjoys because so many of the provisions of the Green Book which s/he now enjoys would no longer be apt.
I cannot imagine even in the hypothetical context the job or jobs being able to remain similar to what they would be now they simply would not fit into any JES manual worker profile and that would have an effect on their terms and conditions (para 36).
Hence the claimants had not established that, if the comparators were based at the same establishment as the claimants, the comparators would still have been employed on Green Book terms and conditions.
The appeal was therefore refused, not because the employment tribunal had applied the wrong legal test, but because the evidence did not support the conclusion on the facts.
To complete the chronology, the Wilkinson case then came before the Court of Session: [2011] CSIH 70, 2012 SC 423.
The Court upheld the decision of the EAT.
Lord Eassie held, at para 35, that: What has to be considered is whether if a manual worker, in casu a gardener, refuse collector, or grave digger, whether hypothetically likely or not, were to be located in the claimants establishment for the performance of his current job he would continue to be employed on terms and conditions applicable to manual workers.
Lady Paton distinguished the case from the present one, because the tribunal had analysed the evidence relating to the terms and conditions of work for the hypothetical transposed worker, and found it not inconceivable that he could be assigned to work at one of the claimants establishments and that, if so, he would still be employed on Green Book terms.
But both she, at para 49, and Lord Hardie, at para 54, disagreed with Lord Eassies further observation, in para 35, that it was: erroneous (perhaps particularly in an equal value claim) to consider whether, on the transfer of the male comparator hypothetically to the womans establishment, adjustment might be made to his terms and conditions to dovetail more closely with those of the female claimant.
Thus, it would appear that, while the Court of Session has rejected the real possibility test, it remains unclear to what extent the Tribunal is obliged to hypothesise about possible adjustments to the terms and conditions which would apply in the unlikely event of the comparator being transferred to work at the same establishment as the claimant.
Discussion
Not surprisingly, Ms Dinah Rose QC, on behalf of the appellant claimants, argues that the tribunal should not speculate about the adjustments to the comparators present terms and conditions which might be made in the unlikely event that they were transferred to the claimants workplace.
The hypothesis is that the comparators are transferred to do their present jobs in a different location.
The question is whether in that event, however unlikely, they would remain employed on the same or broadly similar terms and conditions to those applicable in their current place of work.
As Lord Slynn had recognised in the British Coal Corporation case, the object of the legislation was to allow comparisons to be made between workers who did not and never would work in the same work place.
An example might be a manufacturing company, where the (female) clerical workers worked in an office block, whereas the (male) manufacturers worked in a factory.
She also argues that, the employment tribunal having adopted the correct test, the Court of Session should not have interfered with its findings in fact.
The tribunal had founded its conclusion on the first of the two passages of Mr Archibalds evidence quoted in paragraph 27 above.
This was contemplating that the manual workers would become based in the claimants schools in order to do their present jobs, although he could not envisage that ever happening.
In the second passage, he was hypothesising the creation of a completely new all purpose handyman who might plausibly be based in schools.
That was an unnecessary and illegitimate hypothesis and the tribunal was clearly entitled to conclude that there was no compelling evidence that the comparators would not be employed on the same or broadly similar terms and conditions in the unlikely event that they became based in schools.
Mr Truscott, for the local authority, agrees that there is no need to show a real possibility that the comparators could be transferred to do their current jobs in the claimants workplace.
But, he argues, how does the British Coal Corporation test work in a factual situation such as this, which goes well beyond what was envisaged in that case? That case was premised on the fact that the comparators could be based at the same place as the claimants, even though some of them were not.
So, while he agrees that there is no need to show a real possibility that the workers could be co located, he argues that it should at least be feasible that they might be.
The evidence of Mr Archibald was clear that it was not.
I have no hesitation in preferring the arguments presented by Ms Rose.
In the first place, it is by no means clear from the facts reported in the British Coal Corporation case that all the women claimants were based in collieries where there might also be surface mine workers employed.
In the second place, there is no hint of a real possibility or feasibility test in that case and I find it difficult to discern a genuine difference in principle between them.
Both add an unwarranted gloss to the wording of the subsection as interpreted in the British Coal Corporation case.
In the third place, to adopt such a test would be to defeat the object of the exercise.
This is not just a matter of preventing employers from so organising their workplaces that the women work in one place and the men in another.
There may be perfectly good reasons for organising the work into different places.
But the object of the legislation is to secure equality of treatment, not only for the same work, but also for work rated as equivalent or assessed by the experts to be of equal value.
It stands to reason, therefore, that some very different jobs which are not or cannot be carried out in the same workplaces may nevertheless be rated as equivalent or assessed as having equal value.
One example is the (female) office worker who needs office equipment in a clean environment and the (male) factory worker who needs machines which create dirt and dust.
But another is the (female) factory worker who puts microscopic circuits on silicon chips in one factory and the (male) factory worker who assembles computer parts in another.
The fact that of necessity their work has to be carried on in different places is no barrier to equalising the terms on which it is done.
It is well known that those jobs which require physical strength have traditionally been better rewarded than those jobs which require dexterity.
It is one of the objects of the equality legislation to iron out those traditional inequalities of reward where the work involved is of genuinely equal value.
In the fourth place, it is not the function of the same employment test to
establish comparability between the jobs done.
That comparability is established by the like work, work rated as equivalent and work of equal value tests.
Furthermore, the effect of the deemed equality clause is to modify the relevant term of the womans contract so as not to be less favourable than a term of a similar kind in the contract under which the man is employed or to include a beneficial term in her contract if she has none (section 1(2)(a), (b) or (c) as the case may be).
That modification is clearly capable of taking account of differences in the working hours or holiday entitlement in calculating what would be equally favourable treatment for them both.
Moreover, the equality clause does not operate if a difference in treatment is genuinely due to a material factor other than sex (section 1(3)).
The same employment test should not be used as a proxy for those tests or as a way of avoiding the often difficult and complex issues which they raise (tempting though this may be for large employers faced with multiple claims such as these).
Its function is to establish the terms and conditions with which the comparison is to be made.
The object is simply to weed out those cases in which geography plays a significant part in determining what those terms and conditions are.
In the fifth place, the construction of section 1(6) favoured by the appellants
is more consistent with the requirements of European Union law than is the construction favoured by the respondents.
The 1970 Act was the United Kingdoms way of giving effect in United Kingdom law to the principle of equal treatment of men and women, first enshrined in article 119 EEC, then translated into article 141 EC, and now translated into article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The Court of Justice held as long ago as 1976, in the case of Defrenne v Sabena (Case 43/75) [1976] ICR 547, 566, para 12 that the principle of equal pay for men and women forms part of the foundations of the community and has direct effect in the member states in relation to direct discrimination which may be identified solely with the aid of the criteria based on equal work and equal pay.
As Advocate General Geelhoed explained in Lawrence v Regent Office Care Ltd (Case C 320/00) [2003] ICR 1092: It is not evident from the wording of Article 141 EC that the comparison must be confined to one and the same employer.
Its case law demonstrates that the Court has consistently stood by its requirement that for a finding of direct discrimination there must be a clear difference in pay vis vis male co workers working in the same establishment or service (see, inter alia, Defrenne v Sabena (Case 43/75) [1976] ICR 547, 567, para 22) or that the difference in pay must have its origin in legislative provisions or provisions of collective labour agreements (Defrenne, para 21). (para 46)
There were three categories of case where it was possible to go outside the individual undertaking or service in order to make the comparison: first, where statutory rules applied to the working and pay conditions in more than one undertaking, establishment or service, such as the pay of nurses in the National Health Service; second, where several undertakings or establishments were covered by the same collective works agreement or regulations; and third where terms and conditions were laid down centrally for more than one organisation or business within a holding company or conglomerate (paras 50, 49).
This was because: The feature common to the three categories is that regulation of the terms and conditions of employment actually applied is traceable to one source, whether it be the legislature, the parties to a collective works agreement, or the management of a corporate group (para 51).
This was an essential criterion because article 141 was addressed to those who may be held responsible for the unauthorised differences in terms and conditions of employment (para 52).
Hence: It is clear from the foregoing that the direct effect of article 141 EC extends to employees working for the same legal person or group of legal persons, or for public authorities operating under joint control, as well as cases in which for purposes of job classification and remuneration, a binding collective agreement or statutory regulation applies.
In all these cases the terms and conditions of employment can be traced back to a common source (para 54).
In Lawrence itself, the Court of Justice agreed that the principle was not limited to situations in which men and women worked for the same employer (Judgment, para 17).
But in the case in question, the differences cannot be attributed to a single source, there is no body which is responsible for the inequality and which could restore equal treatment (Judgment, para 18).
This was because the claimants, women cleaners and catering workers who had previously been employed by North Yorkshire County Council and whose work had then been rated as equivalent to that of men doing jobs such as gardening, refuse collection and sewage treatment, were now working for the private company to whom the cleaning and catering service had been contracted out.
They could no longer, therefore, compare their pay and conditions with the men who now worked for a different employer. (It is worth noting that no question had been referred to the court about the effect of the regulations governing the transfer of undertakings.)
The position is thus that, for the principle of equal pay to have direct effect, the difference in treatment must be attributable to a single source which is capable of putting it right.
As it happens, the researches of counsel have discovered no case in the Court of Justice in which the principle of equal pay has not been applied between men and women who work for the same employer.
However, in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs v Robertson [2005] EWCA Civ 138, [2005] ICR 750, the Court of Appeal held that the terms and conditions of civil servants working in different Government departments were not attributable to a single source for the purpose of article 141 EC.
Although they were all the servants of the Crown, responsibility for negotiating and agreeing their pay and conditions had been devolved by delegated legislation to the individual departments concerned.
It was common ground that the claimants and their would be comparators in the Department for Transport, Environment and the Regions were not in the same employment within the meaning of section 1(6) of the 1970 Act, because they did not work at the same establishment and common terms and conditions had not been observed in the two departments since the delegation.
Mr Robin Allen QC, for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, tells us that it is the view of the Commission that Robertson was wrongly decided, because it did lie within the power of the Crown to put matters right.
It is not necessary for us to determine that question now.
In this case it is quite clear that the difference in treatment between the claimants and their comparators is attributable to a single source, namely the local authority which employs them and which is in a position to put right the discrepancy if required to do so.
If section 1(6) were to operate as a barrier to a comparison which was required by EU law in order to give effect to the fundamental principle of equal treatment, it would be our duty to disapply it.
However, for the reasons given earlier, it sets a low threshold which does not operate as a barrier to the comparison proposed in this case.
I would therefore allow this appeal and restore the decision of the
employment tribunal.
The employment judge asked herself the right question and was entitled on the evidence to answer it in the way that she did.
","The issue arising in the appeal is whether the appellants have satisfied the threshold conditions set out in section 1(6) of the Equal Pay Act 1970 (the Act) in order to bring claims alleging that they are employed under less favourable terms and conditions than certain male employees of the respondent council who do work of equal value.
The appellants have to establish that the male employees are in the same employment as they are, notwithstanding the fact that they are employed on different terms and conditions at different establishments from the appellants.
The appellants are 251 classroom assistants, support for learning assistants and nursery nurses employed during school term time in the respondents schools under terms contained in a national collective agreement known as the Blue Book.
The appellants wish to compare their terms and conditions with those enjoyed by a variety of full time manual workers employed by the respondent, as groundsmen, refuse collectors, refuse drivers and a leisure attendant (the comparators), under a different collective agreement known as the Green Book.
The comparators are entitled to a substantial supplement on top of their basic pay, whereas the appellants are not.
The issue of whether the appellants are in the same employment as the comparators was determined in a pre hearing review.
The Employment Tribunal ruled that they are, because the appellants could show that if the comparators were employed at their establishments they would be employed under broadly similar terms to those under which they are employed at present.
The Employment Appeal Tribunal allowed an appeal by the respondent on the ground that the appellants could not show that there was a real possibility that the comparators could be employed in schools to do their existing jobs.
The Court of Session held that this was the wrong test, but that the appellants still failed on the evidence to show that if the comparators were to be based at schools they would be employed on Green Book terms and conditions.
The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the decision of the Employment Tribunal permitting the claims to be brought.
The tribunal will now proceed to decide whether the appellants work is in fact of equal value to that of the comparators and, if so, whether there is an explanation other than the difference in sex for the difference between their terms and conditions.
Lady Hale gives the only judgment.
The requirement that claimants and their chosen comparators are in the same employment before a claim can be brought under the Act does not simply mean that they must be employed by the same employer.
If they do not work at the same establishment as their comparators, claimants must show that they are both employed at establishments in Great Britain at which common terms and conditions of employment are observed either generally or for employees of the relevant classes (s 1 (6) of the Act).
The common terms and conditions are between the comparators terms at different establishments and those on which they are or would be employed at the claimants establishment [12].
It is no answer to say that no such comparators ever would be employed at the same establishment as the claimant, otherwise it would be far too easy for an employer to arrange things so that only men worked in one place and only women in another [13].
The correct hypothesis to consider is the transfer of the comparators to do their present job in a different location [30].
The evidence from the respondents Group Manager of Human Resources confirmed that, although he could not envisage it happening, in the event that the comparators were based in schools then they would retain their Green Book conditions [31].
The Employment Tribunal adopted the correct test and was entitled to find it satisfied on this evidence.
It was not necessary to show that it was feasible to co locate the relevant workers.
This was an unwarranted gloss on s 1(6) [33] and would defeat the object of the legislation.
The fact that of necessity work has to be carried on in different places is no barrier to equalising the terms on which it is done [34].
It is not the function of the same employment test to establish comparability between the jobs done, but simply to weed out those cases in which geography plays a significant part in determining the relevant terms and conditions [35].
This construction of s 1(6) is more consistent with the requirements of European Union law, to which the Act gives effect [36].
Case law of the European Court of Justice has established that for the principle of equal pay to have direct effect, the difference in treatment must be attributable to a single source which is capable of putting it right [40].
That is clearly the case here.
If s 1(6) were to operate as a barrier to a comparison which was required by EU law to give effect to the fundamental principle of equal treatment it would be the courts duty to disapply it.
However, s 1(6) sets a low threshold which does not operate as a barrier to the comparison proposed in this case [42].
"
uksc-2009-0152,"The claimant, Declan OByrne, was vaccinated on 3 November 1992 with an HIB vaccine (the Product).
He alleges that the Product was defective and that it caused him brain damage.
The vaccine in question was manufactured in France by a French company, now known as Aventis Pasteur SA (APSA).
On 18 September 1992 APSA sent a consignment of the vaccine, including the Product, to a company, now known as Aventis Pasteur MSD Ltd (APMSD), in England.
At all relevant times in 1992 APMSD was a wholly owned subsidiary of APSA and acted as a United Kingdom distributor for APSAs products.
APMSD received the consignment on 22 September.
On an unknown date, probably in late September or early October, APMSD sold part of the consignment, including the Product, to the Department of Health, which in turn supplied it to the medical practice which used it to vaccinate the claimant.
On 1 August 2001 the claimant began proceedings for damages against APMSD, alleging that he had suffered damage caused by a defect in the Product which APMSD had manufactured and/or produced and so it was liable under section 2 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987.
In its defence, served in November 2001, APMSD pointed out that it was not the manufacturer, but merely the distributor, of the Product.
In response to a further request, in April 2002 APMSD identified APSA as the manufacturer of the Product.
On 16 October 2002 the claimant issued separate proceedings against APSA, also under section 2 of the Consumer Protection Act, alleging that APSA was the producer of the Product and claiming damages against it.
APSA defended the action on the basis, inter alia, that it had put the Product into circulation either on 18 September 1992, when it sent the Product to APMSD, or on 22 September 1992 when APMSD received it.
APSA contended that, in these circumstances, the claimants action against it was time barred since it had been raised more than 10 years after APSA had put the Product into circulation.
In advancing this defence, APSA relied on section 11A(3) of the Limitation Act 1980 and Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (OJ 1985 L210, p 29) (the Directive), which provides: Member States shall provide in their legislation that the rights conferred upon the injured person pursuant to this Directive shall be extinguished upon the expiry of a period of ten years from the date on which the producer put into circulation the actual product which caused the damage, unless the injured person has in the meantime instituted proceedings against the producer.
Faced with this defence in his action against APSA, in his action against APMSD with which this appeal is concerned the claimant applied on 10 March 2003 for an order that APSA be substituted as defendant in place of APMSD.
The application was based on section 35(5)(b) and (6)(a) of the Limitation Act 1980 and rule 19.5(3)(a) of the CPR.
It is, of course, common ground that the application was made after the expiry of the ten year time limit under Article 11 for initiating proceedings against the producer of the Product.
In these circumstances APSA contended that, in so far as English law might permit APSA to be substituted after the expiry of the time limit, it was inconsistent with Article 11.
By contrast, the claimant contended that provisions of domestic law permitting this substitution would not be inconsistent with Article 11.
In November 2003, at the request of both parties, the High Court made a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice.
The European Court answered three questions: OByrne v Sanofi Pasteur MSD Ltd (formerly Aventis Pasteur MSD Ltd) (Case C 127/04) [2006] 1 WLR 1606.
One of the questions concerned the point in time at which a product was put into circulation for purposes of Article 11 in a situation where the producer which manufactured it then transferred it to a distribution subsidiary.
I quote and discuss the European Courts ruling on this point at paras 20 23 below.
concerned, the European Court held, [2006] 1 WLR 1606, 1622: So far as the power to substitute one producer for another as defendant was When an action is brought against a company mistakenly considered to be the producer of a product whereas, in reality, it was manufactured by another company, it is as a rule for national law to determine the conditions in accordance with which one party may be substituted for another in the context of such an action.
A national court examining the conditions governing such a substitution must, however, ensure that due regard is had to the personal scope of Directive 85/374, as established by Articles 1 and 3 thereof.
In the light of this answer, Teare J allowed the claimants application for substitution of APSA in place of APSMD, pursuant to section 35(5)(b) and (6)(a) of the Limitation Act 1980 and rule 19.5(3)(a) of the CPR, on the ground that the claimant had named APMSD as the defendant in mistake for APSA: OByrne v Aventis Pasteur MSD Ltd [2007] 1 WLR 757.
APSA appealed, but the Court of Appeal (Sir Anthony Clarke MR, Arden and Moore Bick LJJ) [2008] 1 WLR 1188 dismissed its appeal.
The House of Lords granted APSA leave to appeal.
At the hearing of the appeal a majority of the appellate committee considered that it was clear that the European Court was saying that, in some circumstances, proceedings, which are obviously intended to be proceedings against the producer but which use the wrong name, can properly be treated by national procedural law as having been proceedings against the producer.
The majority considered that this would have been the proper approach in the circumstances in the present case and so they would have dismissed APSAs appeal.
But, because this was not the unanimous view of the appellate committee as to the effect of the judgment of the European Court, the House of Lords referred the case to Luxembourg for a second time: [2008] 4 All ER 881.
The decision on this reference was given by the Grand Chamber: Aventis Pasteur SA v OB (Case C 358/08) (unreported) given 2 December 2009.
The answer returned by the European Court in response to the second reference is not in line with either of the interpretations of its judgment on the first reference which had been advanced before the appellate committee.
Happily, however, this time the core answer could not be clearer: Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, which allows the substitution of one defendant for another during proceedings, from being applied in a way which permits a producer, within the meaning of Article 3 of that directive, to be sued, after the expiry of the period prescribed by that article, as defendant in proceedings brought within that period against another person.
Putting the point shortly and subject to the important qualification which I must address in a moment the Court of Justice holds that, once ten years have passed since a producer put a product into circulation, that producer cannot be sued, unless proceedings have been taken against it within the ten year period.
As the Court explains, at para 38 of its judgment, Article 11: provides for a uniform 10 year period after which those rights are extinguished.
It fixes, in a binding manner, the starting point of that period as the date on which the producer put into circulation the product which caused the damage.
It specifies the institution of proceedings against that producer as the only reason for that period to be interrupted.
It follows, as the Court says at para 44, that a rule of national law which allows the substitution of one defendant for another during proceedings cannot, under Directive 85/374, be applied in a way which permits such a producer to be sued, after the expiry of that period, as defendant in proceedings brought within that period against another person.
As it explained in paras 41 43 of its judgment, the Court adopted this approach because, in its view, it gave effect to the balance which the Community legislator had intended to achieve between the interests of consumers and producers: 41.
Pursuant to the 11th recital in the preamble to Directive 85/374, the latter seeks, second, to limit, at Community level, the liability of the producer to a reasonable length of time, having regard to the gradual ageing of products, the increasing strictness of safety standards and the constant progressions in the state of science and technology. 42.
As is stated by the Advocate General in points 49 and 50 of her Opinion, the Community legislatures intention to limit in time the no fault liability established by Directive 85/374 is also intended to take account of the fact that that liability represents, for the producer, a greater burden than under a traditional system of liability, so as not to restrict technical progress and to maintain the possibility of insuring against risks connected with that specific liability (see, to that effect, paragraph 3.2.4 of the Report from the Commission of 31 January 2001 on the Application of Directive 85/374 on Liability for Defective Products, COM (2000) 893 final). 43.
It follows that, without prejudice to the possible application of the rules on contractual or non contractual liability or a special liability system existing at the moment when Directive 85/374 was notified, the application of which is not prejudiced by the latter, as is apparent from Article 13 thereof and the 13th recital in the preamble thereto, the producer, as defined in Article 3 of that directive, is, under Article 11 of that directive, relieved of his liability under that article upon the expiry of a period of 10 years from the putting into circulation of the product in question, unless, in the meantime, proceedings have been instituted against him.
The European Court also went out of its way, at para 48, to emphasise that it made no difference if the failure to sue a particular producer within the relevant ten year period had been due to some mistake on the claimants part.
Even in that event what mattered was that the ten years had expired without that producer having been sued.
So it could not be substituted as defendant after the ten years were up: 48.
It should also be added that subjective elements deriving, for example, from the wrongful attribution, by the injured person, of the status of manufacturer of the allegedly defective product to a company which is not the manufacturer, or from the injured persons genuine intention to proceed against that manufacturer by way of its action against such other company, cannot, without infringing the objective dimension of the harmonisation rules laid down by Directive 85/374, justify the substitution, after the expiry of the 10 year period set out in Article 11 thereof, of that manufacturer in proceedings initiated during that period against another person (see, to that effect, OByrne, paragraph 26 and, by analogy, Case C 51/05 P Commission v Cantina sociale di Dolianova and Others [2008] ECR I 5341, paragraphs 59 to 63).
In these circumstances the claimant now accepts that he cannot use section 35 of the Limitation Act 1980 as a basis for substituting APSA for APMSD as the defendant in the present proceedings.
The claimant submits, however, that, even though he cannot make the substitution on the basis of his mistake, the European Court indicated in its judgment a different basis on which he can actually make the desired substitution.
For this purpose he relies on the second answer which the Court of Justice gave on the second reference: However, first, Article 11 must be interpreted as not precluding a national court from holding that, in the proceedings instituted within the period prescribed by that article against the wholly owned subsidiary of the producer, within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 85/374, that producer can be substituted for that subsidiary if that court finds that the putting into circulation of the product in question was, in fact, determined by that producer.
In short, the claimant submits that the position falls within the terms of this qualification to the European Courts core answer on the effect of Article 11 and so there is nothing to prevent him from substituting APSA for APMSD on this basis.
APSA contends, however, that this passage in the Courts judgment has to be interpreted in the context of the judgment as a whole and in the light of the Opinion of Advocate General Trstenjak, 8 September 2009, unreported, which preceded it.
When that is done, APSA says, it can be seen that the qualification should be given a narrower interpretation, which would not allow substitution in this case.
As will become apparent, in a case like the present, the possibility of substitution depends, to some extent, on various matters of fact concerning the relationship between the two entities.
At the hearing before this Court, however, on the basis of what he now knows about the facts, the claimants counsel, Mr Maskrey QC, accepted that, if the Court were to conclude that APSAs interpretation of the European Courts judgment was correct, then its appeal against its substitution for APMSD should be allowed.
The dispute between the parties turns, therefore, on the interpretation of paras 49 53 of the judgment of the European Court on the second reference: 49.
In light of the foregoing, Article 11 of Directive 85/374 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which allows the substitution of one defendant for another during proceedings from being applied in a way which permits a producer, within the meaning of Article 3 of that directive, to be sued, after the expiry of the period prescribed by that article, as defendant in proceedings brought within that period against another person. 50.
However, the Court, giving a preliminary ruling on a reference, has jurisdiction, in the light of the information in the case file, to give clarifications to guide the referring court in giving judgment in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, Case C 366/98 Geffroy [2000] ECR I 6579, paragraph 20, and Case C 446/07 Severi [2009] ECR I 0000, paragraph 60). 51.
It should be noted in that regard, first, that it is apparent from the reference for a preliminary ruling that APMSD (formerly Mrieux UK), which in 1992 supplied the vaccine which was administered to OB to the United Kingdom Department of Health, was, at that time, a wholly owned subsidiary of APSA (formerly Pasteur Mrieux). 52.
In such a context, it is for the national court, in accordance with the applicable rules of national law on matters of proof, to assess whether the putting into circulation of the product in question was, in fact, determined by the parent company which manufactured it. 53.
Where the national court notes that fact, Article 11 of Directive 85/374 does not preclude that court from holding that, in the proceedings instigated within the period prescribed by that article against the subsidiary under the system of liability laid down by that directive, the parent company, producer within the meaning of Article 3(1) of that directive, can be substituted for that subsidiary.
Under reference to its reasoning in paras 34 48, in para 49 the European Court gave its core ruling on the construction of Article 11, which I have already discussed.
The Court then went on, in the subsequent paragraphs, to give some additional guidance which it considered might be helpful to any domestic judges who were going to be dealing with this particular case.
There is nothing, however, to suggest that, in these paragraphs, the Court was intending to depart from the principled approach which it had just been at such pains to develop and finally to formulate in para 49.
What the Court says in paras 50 54 must therefore be read in the light of that core decision.
In other words, the Court is explaining how that decision may fall to be applied, depending on the domestic courts assessment of the practical relationship between the manufacturer, APSA, and the distributor, APMSD.
In venturing to give this additional assistance the European Court was following the lead of the Advocate General.
Although the structure of her Opinion makes for repetition, it is clear that she, too, had concluded that only the bringing of proceedings against the particular producer could stop the Article 11 time bar from taking effect ten years after the producer had put the relevant product into circulation.
See, in particular, paras 61 and 69 78 of her Opinion.
So, in reaching its conclusion in para 49 of its judgment, the Court was following this aspect of the Advocate Generals reasoning.
The Advocate General went on to hold, at para 68, that a substitution of the producer as a defendant when he has been released by the expiry of the ten year limitation period is equally incompatible with the Directive.
She gave her reasoning for this conclusion at para 79, where she said that to allow the substitution of a producer against which proceedings had not been taken within the ten year period in place of a producer against which they had been taken would de facto be capable of also interrupting the limitation period in relation to producers.
The upper temporal limit of liability for producers in Article 11 would thereby be broken through, and that is excluded in the light of the complete harmonisation of the field which is the aim of Directive 85/374.
So, when reaching the comparable conclusion at paras 44 47 of its judgment, the European Court was, again, following the Advocate Generals approach.
The Advocate General also gave some thought to how Article 11, thus interpreted, should be applied in a case, like the present, where the parent manufacturing producer (APSA) transferred the Product to a distributor (APMSD) which was its wholly owned subsidiary.
In this connexion the Advocate General referred back to the judgment of the European Court on the first reference: OByrne v Sanofi Pasteur MSD Ltd (formerly Aventis Pasteur MSD Ltd) [2006] 1 WLR 1606.
The first ruling in that judgment, at p 1622, had been in these terms: Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products is to be interpreted as meaning that a product is put into circulation when it is taken out of the manufacturing process operated by the producer and enters a marketing process in the form in which it is offered to the public in order to be used or consumed.
This conclusion reflects what the Court says in para 27 of its judgment, which is, in turn, based on its reasoning in the preceding paras 20 26.
Paragraphs 27 32, [2006] 1 WLR 1606, 1620 1621, are of importance in the present context: 27.
In light of those considerations, a product must be considered as having been put into circulation, within the meaning of Article 11 of the Directive, when it leaves the production process operated by the producer and enters a marketing process in the form in which it is offered to the public in order to be used or consumed. 28.
Generally, it is not important in that regard that the product is sold directly by the producer to the user or to the consumer or that that sale is carried out as part of a distribution process involving one or more operators, such as that envisaged in Article 3(3) of the Directive. 29.
When one of the links in the distribution chain is closely connected to the producer, for example, in the case of a wholly owned subsidiary of the latter, it is necessary to establish whether it is a consequence of that link that that entity is in reality involved in the manufacturing process of the product concerned. 30.
The examination of such a close relationship must not be influenced by the question whether or not distinct legal persons are involved.
On the other hand it is of relevance whether those are companies carrying out different production activities or are, on the contrary, companies one of which, ie the subsidiary company, acts simply as a distributor or depository for the product manufactured by the parent company.
It is for the national courts to establish, having regard to the circumstances of each case and the factual situation of the matter before them, whether the links between the producer and another entity are so close that the concept of producer within the meaning of Articles 7 and 11 of the Directive also includes that latter entity and that the transfer of the product from one to the other of those entities does not amount to putting it into circulation within the meaning of those provisions. 31.
In any case, contrary to what is maintained by the defendants, the fact that the products are invoiced to a subsidiary company and that the latter, like any purchaser, pays the price, is not conclusive.
The same applies to the question of knowing which entity is to be considered as owner of the products. 32.
Therefore the reply to the first question must be that Article 11 of the Directive is to be interpreted as meaning that a product is put into circulation when it is taken out of the manufacturing process operated by the producer and enters a marketing process in the form in which it is offered to the public in order to be used or consumed.
As can be seen from para 31 of the European Courts judgment, in the first reference APSA which naturally wanted to push the starting date for the ten year period back as far as possible was arguing that it had put the Product into circulation when it transferred the consignment containing the Product to APMSD in the period of 18 to 22 September 1992.
In support of that argument APSA was pointing to the fact that APMSD had been invoiced for the consignment and had paid for it.
The claimants counsel, who was, of course, contending for as late a date as possible for the Product being put into circulation, was contending that this had not happened until APMSD supplied it to the Department of Health.
The European Court rejected any approach that was based on the formal legal relationship between the parent manufacturing producer and the subsidiary distributor.
In particular, the Court emphasised, at para 30, that the fact that the manufacturer and the distributor were distinct legal entities was irrelevant.
The national court had to look at all the links between the two entities and decide on that basis whether they were so close that, for the purposes of Article 11, the concept of the manufacturing producer (which would apply to APSA) really included the distributor (in this case, APMSD).
In that event, even if the Product were transferred from one to the other, this would not mean that it had been taken out of the manufacturing process operated by the producer.
So, applying the test in para 27 of that judgment, for the purposes of Article 11 the Product would not have been put into circulation by the manufacturing producer when it transferred it to the distributor.
Obviously, the Courts concern was that, unless this were indeed the position, at least in the case of products with a long shelf life, by the time they were eventually put on the market by the distributor, a significant part of the ten year period for proceedings against the manufacturing producer might have elapsed.
This would upset the balance which the Directive sought to maintain between the interests of the consumer and the producer.
In paras 83 90 of her Opinion on the second reference, the Advocate General did indeed make use of this part of the Courts analysis in the first reference when considering how the domestic court might determine the date at which the Product was put into circulation.
But she also used it for the rather different purpose of showing when a distribution subsidiary could be so closely involved with the parent producer that they could, in effect, be regarded as one for the purposes of Article 11.
In that event, suing the subsidiary would be tantamount to suing the parent.
In concrete terms, if that were the position in this case, by suing APMSD within the ten year period, the claimant would also have sued APSA within that period.
So the Article 11 time bar would not bite and the claimant could, if he wished, substitute APSA for APMSD as defendant in the present action or, indeed, simply proceed with his (second) action against APSA.
The Advocate Generals reasoning and conclusions on these matters are to be found in paras 109 113 of her Opinion: 109.
If, by contrast, the national courts were to reach the conclusion in the main proceedings that a supplier such as APMSD was, because of its involvement in the manufacturing process operated by APSA, to be regarded together with APSA as a producer within the meaning of the first half of Article 3(1) of Directive 85/374, the bringing of proceedings in due time against APMSD would indeed have the effect of interrupting the limitation period in relation to APSA. 110.
The decisive point here is the fact that a supplier who is sufficiently closely involved in the manufacturing process operated by the producer is to be classified together with the producer as a producer within the meaning of the first half of Article 3(1) of the directive.
Because those two entities are to be regarded, in the light of the functional interpretation of the concept of producer, as one producer within the meaning of the first half of Article 3(1), the limitation period must also run in the same way for both entities. 111.
In this connection the Court in OByrne, after carefully weighing up the interests of consumers and producers, synchronised the starting point of the 10 year limitation period under Article 11 of Directive 85/374 for the producer stricto sensu and the supplier who forms part of the manufacturing process by reference to the date on which the supplier puts the product into circulation.
In the context of the same balancing of interests, the running of the limitation period must also be uniform. 112.
Since the running of the limitation period under Article 11 of the directive is interrupted only by the bringing of proceedings, a uniform limitation period for the producer and supplier who are to be regarded together as a producer within the meaning of the first half of Article 3(1) presupposes that the bringing of proceedings against the supplier interrupts the running of the 10 year limitation period not only in relation to that supplier but also in relation to the producer in whose manufacturing process the supplier is involved. 113.
Accordingly, my conclusion is that classification to be assessed by the national courts of the supplier of a product as its producer has the consequence that that supplier is liable under Article 1 of the directive for the damage caused by a defect in the product, regardless of whether he is classified as a producer within the meaning of Article 3(1) or a producer within the meaning of Article 3(3) of the directive.
Classification of a supplier as a producer within the meaning of the first half of Article 3(1) of the directive has the further consequence that the 10 year limitation period for the producer in whose manufacturing process the supplier is involved does not start to run until the time when the supplier puts the product into circulation.
At the same time, proceedings brought against that supplier will in that case interrupt the running of the limitation period under Article 11 of the directive in relation also to the producer in whose manufacturing process the supplier is involved.
In the summary which she gives in para 115, the Advocate General repeats the conclusion which she reaches in para 113.
Two points stand out.
First, the Advocate Generals conclusion in paras 113 and 115 involves no departure from the principle that the Article 11 time bar can only be interrupted by bringing proceedings against the producer concerned.
Secondly, when she contemplates the domestic court classifying a supplier as a producer within the meaning of Article 3(1), she contemplates the domestic court applying the approach of the European Court in its judgment on the first reference: OByrne v Sanofi Pasteur MSD Ltd (formerly Aventis Pasteur MSD Ltd) [2006] 1 WLR 1606.
And as the Advocate General recalls at paras 111 and 113 according to that judgment, where the supplier forms part of the manufacturing process, the starting point of the ten year limitation period under Article 11 is fixed by reference to the date on which the supplier puts the product into circulation.
Indeed, in the proceedings on the first reference, the claimant fought successfully to establish exactly that point.
With this background in mind, it is appropriate to return to paras 51 and 52 of the European Courts judgment on the second reference: 51.
It should be noted in that regard, first, that it is apparent from the reference for a preliminary ruling that APMSD (formerly Mrieux UK), which in 1992 supplied the vaccine which was administered to OB to the United Kingdom Department of Health, was, at that time, a wholly owned subsidiary of APSA (formerly Pasteur Mrieux). 52.
In such a context, it is for the national court, in accordance with the applicable rules of national law on matters of proof, to assess whether the putting into circulation of the product in question was, in fact, determined by the parent company which manufactured it.
It is correct to say that, unlike the Advocate General, the European Court does not actually refer to its answer to the first question on the first reference.
But there is nothing whatever to suggest that it intended to depart in any way from that analysis.
The assumption must therefore be that it falls to be applied where appropriate.
Certainly, the Court supplies no alternative or additional theoretical analysis which could displace or supplement it.
The European Court is concerned to show how the principle which it has just laid down would apply in relation to the substitution of APSA for APMSD.
Certainly, to judge by the Advocate Generals analysis and there is no rival the only way in which that principle could be maintained and yet APSA could be substituted for APMSD, would be if, by suing APMSD, the claimant had, in effect, sued APSA.
So the Court must be pointing the domestic court to the way in which it should approach that issue.
Mr Maskrey argued, however, that the position was really much simpler.
As the European Court noted, at para 51, APMSD was a wholly owned subsidiary of APSA.
Secondly, APSA had determined that the Product should be put into circulation by transferring it to its wholly owned subsidiary, APMSD, and it had then in fact transferred the product to the subsidiary.
So the requirements of paras 51 and 52 were fulfilled and the substitution could be made.
I would reject that argument.
As counsel freely admitted, this argument runs completely counter to the one which the claimant advanced on the first reference.
That is, of course, merely a forensic point.
More significantly, the argument is internally incoherent as well as being inconsistent with the reasoning of the Court of Justice.
If, as counsel now contends, APSA put the Product into circulation when it supplied it to APMSD, then, consistently with the Courts ruling on the first reference, this can only be because the two companies are to be regarded as having operated quite distinctly so that the Product was taken out of the manufacturing process operated by APSA when it was transferred to APMSD.
But the fact that APMSD was a wholly owned subsidiary of APSA, which the Court began by noting in para 51, could not be a pointer towards that conclusion.
If anything, it would point against it.
So, on this interpretation, the European Court could have had no reason to draw attention to the status of APMSD.
Yet it did.
Mr Maskrey criticised APSAs interpretation of para 52 on the specific ground that it involved reading in three words: whether the putting into circulation of the product in question by the supplier, was, in fact, determined by the parent company which manufactured it.
Mr Leggatt QC accepted that this was, in effect, how he contended that the sentence should be interpreted.
In my view, that is indeed the correct interpretation.
The European Courts reference to APMSD being a wholly owned subsidiary of APSA is only consistent with it directing attention to factors which may point to a close connexion between the two companies.
Given the context of the discussion (seeing whether proceedings against APMSD count as proceedings against APSA), that is precisely what we would expect.
For the reasons already given, we should also expect the focus to be on the time when the Product was supplied by APMSD to the Department of Health, since, if APMSD was, in effect, tied into the manufacturing process of APSA, the Product would only be put into circulation when it was supplied by APMSD.
And that is what we find in para 51 where the European Court refers to APMSDs status as a wholly owned subsidiary at the time when it supplied the Product to the Department of Health.
Therefore, in para 52 the Court must indeed be referring to the Product being put into circulation by the supplier at the behest of its parent.
That interpretation is also consistent, of course, with what the Advocate General says in paras 111 and 113 of her Opinion on the second reference (quoted at para 24 above).
This interpretation of para 52 is also consistent with its language, both in the English version and in the original French (si la mise en circulation du produit concern a t dtermine en fait par la socit mre qui la fabriqu).
The European Court is plainly contemplating a situation where, to all outward appearances, a supplier has decided to put a product into circulation.
The domestic court must look at the circumstances to see whether, despite appearances, in fact, it was the manufacturing parent company which had determined that the product should be put into circulation.
If, by contrast, the European Court had meant what Mr Maskrey suggested, it would have had no reason to use this language: all it would have required to say was that the national court was to assess whether the parent company, which manufactured the product, transferred it to its wholly owned subsidiary, the distributor.
The further difficulty with that interpretation is, of course, that everyone agrees that APSA sent the consignment containing the Product to APMSD on 18 September and that APMSD received it on 22 September.
There would therefore be nothing for the domestic court to assess.
The European Court was therefore indicating, in para 52, that the domestic court was to consider, in accordance with domestic rules of proof, whether the manufacturer, APSA, was in fact controlling APMSD and determining when it put the Product into circulation.
There is nothing in the judgment of the European Court on either reference to suggest that the fact that APMSD was a wholly owned subsidiary of APSA could somehow, of itself, be a reason for allowing APSA to be substituted after the expiry of the ten year period.
Indeed, that would be inconsistent with the two companies being distinct entities.
Rather, the fact that APMSD was a wholly owned subsidiary was simply one by no means decisive factor to be taken into account by the domestic court when assessing how closely the subsidiary was involved with its parents business as an Article 3(1) producer.
All the circumstances would have to be taken into account.
If APSA was indeed in a position to decide when the Product was to be distributed, then APMSD would be integrated into the manufacturing process and so tightly controlled by APSA that proceedings against APMSD could properly be regarded as proceedings against the parent company, APSA.
Hence, as the European Court goes on to hold in para 53, the manufacturing parent company could be substituted for the subsidiary APSA for APMSD.
Mr Maskrey submitted that, if the European Courts judgment were interpreted in this way, then it would allow substitution of the parent producer only where the supplier could, in any event, itself be sued as a producer falling within the definition in Article 3(1).
But that is, of course, precisely what the Advocate General does say in paras 113 and 115 of her Opinion.
Moreover, the criticism seems a little ungenerous.
It is, after all, the claimant who, for what must presumably appear to him to be good reasons, wishes to substitute APSA for APMSD as the defendant.
The Advocate General and the Court are merely responding to that situation by pointing to circumstances where it might indeed be possible for the claimant to do so.
It is, of course, the case that, in any such circumstances, the claimant will also be able to sue the supplier as a producer within the terms of Article 3(1).
But that is not a criticism of the approach taken by the Advocate General or the Court.
If a claimant will gain nothing by suing the manufacturer in substitution for the supplier, he will presumably not try to do so.
But such a course might have advantages if, say, the supplier were insolvent.
The Advocate General and the European Court were entitled to assume that, in this case, the claimant had what he regarded as good reasons for wishing to make the substitution.
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and set aside paragraph 1 of the order of Teare J dated 20 October 2006 substituting Aventis Pasteur SA for Aventis Pasteur MSD in the present action, HQ02X00848.
","The Respondent was vaccinated on 3 November 1992 with a vaccine (the Product) manufactured in France by a French company, now known as Aventis Pasteur SA (APSA).
On 18 September 1992 APSA sent a consignment of the vaccine, including the Product, to its then wholly owned subsidiary, Aventis Pasteur MSD Ltd (APMSD), in England.
APMSD acted as a United Kingdom distributor for APSAs products.
APMSD received the consignment on 22 September 1992 and sold part of it, including the Product, on an unknown date.
The Product was eventually used to vaccinate the Respondent.
On 1 August 2001 the Respondent began proceedings under section 2 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 (CPA) against APMSD, alleging that the Product was defective and had caused him brain damage.
On 16 October 2002 the Respondent issued separate proceedings against APSA also under section 2 of the CPA.
Relying on section 11(3) of the Limitation Act 1980 (the LA) and Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 (the Directive), APSA defended this action on the basis that it had been raised more than ten years after APSA had put the Product into circulation, which APSA alleged was 22 September 1992 at the latest.
Broadly, Article 11 provides that there is a ten year time limit for initiating proceedings against the producer (as defined in the Directive) of a product.
Faced with this defence, the Respondent sought an order that APSA be substituted as a defendant in place of APMSD in the proceedings against APMSD, relying on section 35(5)(b) and (6)(a) of the LA.
These provisions allow a new party to be substituted for a party whose name was given in any claim made in the original action in mistake.
APSA contended that, in so far as English law permitted such substitution after the expiry of the time limit, it was inconsistent with Article 11.
The High Court made a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
So far as the power to substitute one producer for another as defendant was concerned, the House of Lords (to which the case eventually came) could not reach a unanimous view as to the effect of the ECJs judgment.
The House of Lords therefore referred the question back to the ECJ.
The answer returned by the ECJ is now clear: once ten years have passed since a producer put a product into circulation, that producer cannot be sued unless proceedings have been taken against it within the ten year period.
The Respondent now accepts that he cannot use section 35 of the LA as a basis for substituting APSA for APMSD as the defendant in the present proceedings.
The Respondent submits, however, that in its judgment the ECJ indicated a different basis on which he can actually make the desired substitution, namely, that in proceedings instituted within the ten year period against the wholly owned subsidiary of the producer, that producer can be substituted for that subsidiary if the domestic court finds that the putting into circulation of the product in question was,
in fact, determined by that producer.
The dispute between the parties therefore turns on the interpretation of that part of the ECJs judgment.
The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal and set aside paragraph 1 of the order of Teare J dated 20 October 2006 substituting APSA for APMSD in the present action.
Lord Rodger gave the judgment of the Court.
There is nothing to suggest that, when providing the additional guidance which is the subject of the dispute in the present case, the ECJ was intending to depart from the principled approach which it had formulated earlier in its judgment, namely, that Article 11 precluded national legislation being applied in a way which permitted a producer to be sued after the expiry of the ten year limitation period as defendant in proceedings brought within that period against another person (para 17).
In venturing to give the additional guidance, the ECJ was following the lead of the Advocate General.
The Advocate General had given some thought to how Article 11 should be applied in a case like the present, where APSA transferred the Product to a distributor, APMSD, which was its wholly owned subsidiary.
In doing so, the Advocate General had referred back to the ECJs judgment on the first reference where the ECJ had held that a product is put into circulation when it is taken out of the manufacturing process operated by the producer and enters a marketing process in the form in which it is offered to the public in order to be used or consumed (paras 18 20).
The ECJ, in its judgment following the first reference, had rejected an approach that was based on the formal legal relationship between the parent manufacturing producer and the subsidiary distributor.
The national court had to look at all the links between the two entities and decide on that basis whether they were so close that, for the purposes of Article 11, the concept of the manufacturing producer (which would apply to APSA) really included the distributor (in this case, APMSD).
In that event, even if the Product were transferred from one to the other, this would not mean that it had been taken out of the manufacturing process operated by the producer (para 22).
The Advocate General made use of that part of the ECJs analysis from the first reference to show when a distribution subsidiary could be so closely involved with the parent producer that they could, in effect, be regarded as one for the purposes of Article 11 (so that suing the subsidiary would be tantamount to suing the parent).
In concrete terms, if that were the position in this case, by suing APMSD within the ten year period, the Respondent would also have sued APSA within that period.
So the Article 11 time bar would not bite and the Respondent could, if he wished, substitute APSA for APMSD as defendant in the present action (para 23).
It is with this background in mind that the ECJ gave its additional guidance in the second reference.
There is nothing to suggest that, in giving that guidance, it was intending to depart in any way from the analysis in its first reference (para 27).
Certainly, to judge from the Advocate Generals analysis, the only way in which the principle that had just been laid down in relation to the substitution of APSA for APMSD could be maintained and yet APSA could be substituted for APMSD would be if, by suing APMSD, the Respondent had in effect sued APSA (para 28).
The ECJ was therefore indicating, in giving its guidance, that the domestic court was to consider, in accordance with domestic rules of proof, whether the manufacturer, APSA, was in fact controlling APMSD and determining when it put the Product into circulation.
The fact that APSA was a wholly owned subsidiary was simply one by no means decisive factor to be taken into
account by the domestic court when assessing how closely the subsidiary was involved with its parents business as a producer.
All the circumstances would have to be taken into account.
If APSA was indeed in a position to decide when the Product was distributed, then APMSD would be integrated into the manufacturing process and would be so tightly controlled by APSA that proceedings against APMSD could properly be regarded as proceedings against the parent company, APSA.
Hence, the manufacturing company could be substituted for the subsidiary (para 34).
"
uksc-2014-0094,"The Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 created for the first time in the United Kingdom an officer, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, charged with investigating complaints of maladministration against government departments and a limited number of other public authorities exercising the functions of the Crown or controlled or funded by the Crown.
Since then, ombudsmen have come to fulfil an increasingly important role in mediating between the state and the public service on the one hand and the citizen on the other.
Commissioners have been established for complaints against the National Health Service since 1973, for complaints against local government since 1974 and for complaints against social housing landlords since 1996.
There are also separate Commissioners charged with examining complaints against public bodies or the providers of public services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
There are currently 19 statutory officers charged with the handling of complaints against government departments, local government, the National Health Service and other public authorities or undertakers.
They are generally known as ombudsmen, after the officer of that title first established in Sweden in 1809.
In some cases, the same person performs the functions of more than one ombudsman, but each role has its own statutory basis.
The various enactments have a strong family resemblance.
But some of them have distinctive features which mean that considerable caution is required before principles derived from one legislative scheme can be read across to another.
In 1969, two ombudsmen were established for Northern Ireland.
The Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 established a Northern Ireland Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (later known as the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland).
His role and powers were closely modelled on those of the Commissioner established by the United Kingdom Act of 1967.
The Commissioner for Complaints Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 established a Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints.
I shall call him the Complaints Commissioner.
He is charged with reporting on complaints against bodies which were not within the jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Commissioner, notably local authorities, the Northern Ireland Health Board and various public statutory undertakers.
Since 1972, the same person has held both offices.
But until recently (see below) his two roles have had distinct legislative foundations.
It is therefore necessary to have regard to the particular capacity in which an ombudsman is acting and the particular legislation governing that function in order to determine what his powers are.
The current legislation comprises two Orders in Council made on the same day in 1996, which repealed and replaced the corresponding Acts of 1969.
They are the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (SI 1996/1298 (NI 8)), governing the work of the Assembly Ombudsman, and the Commissioner for Complaints (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (SI 1996/1297 (NI 7)), governing that of the Complaints Commissioner.
This appeal is about the powers of the Complaints Commissioner under the latter order, which I shall call the 1996 Order.
In particular it is about his powers in relation to general medical practitioners working in the National Health Service.
In Northern Ireland, as in other parts of the United Kingdom, the National Health Service is one of the main sources of complaints.
The original jurisdiction of the Complaints Commissioner extended to the various boards and committees responsible for the administration of the National Health Service in Northern Ireland.
But it was confined to maladministration and did not extend to any action in the discharge of a professional duty by a medical or dental practitioner, pharmacist, nurse, midwife or member of a profession supplementary to medicine in the course of diagnosis, treatment or care of a particular patient: see the
Commissioner for Complaints Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, Schedule 2, paragraph
That jurisdiction was preserved in the 1996 Order.
But the position was significantly altered by an amendment of 1997, which followed a similar amendment to the United Kingdom legislation.
Its effect was to extend the Complaints Commissioners jurisdiction to the merits of a decision to the extent that it was taken in consequence of the exercise of clinical judgment: see article 8(7) of the 1996 Order as amended. 4.
The main questions at issue in this appeal are whether, and if so in what circumstances, the Complaints Commissioner has power to recommend the payment of a money sum to a complainant; and whether in the event that that sum is not paid he has power to make a special report drawing the attention of the legislature to that fact.
The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal decided that the answer in each case was no.
These questions will shortly become moot.
The Public Services Ombudsman Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 abolishes the offices of both the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the Complaints Commissioner with effect from 1 April 2016, and combines their functions in a new officer, the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman.
The jurisdiction and powers of the new office are in some respects greater than those of either of its predecessors, and his mode of operation different.
But the new Act has no bearing on the present appeal.
The transitional provisions provide for current matters to be transferred to the Public Services Ombudsman, but to be dealt with by him in accordance with the 1996 legislation.
We have been told that there are some 53 reports completed since the decision of the Court of Appeal which have been held back pending the determination of this appeal, and that in four further cases payment of a money sum has been recommended but the recommendation has not been followed.
The facts
The respondent is a general medical practitioner in sole practice in Northern Ireland.
The National Health Service operates in Northern Ireland through a Health and Social Care Board.
The respondent provides general medical services under contract with the board for his area under Part VI of the Health and Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 (SI 1972/1265 (NI 14)).
This means that complaints against him are liable to be investigated by the Commissioner under article 8 of the 1996 Order.
I shall deal below with the scope of that article.
The complainant is the widow of one of his patients, who has been referred to in this litigation as R. R died on 6 January 2009 of a myocardial infarction.
The complaint concerns the care and treatment received by him during the last eight months of his life.
He attended the respondents surgery on 30 May 2008 to ask for a heart screen.
Although he had no symptoms and was not complaining of chest pains, he was referred to a NHS hospital for a treadmill test.
The test was carried out in July, but terminated early due to fatigue.
The test recorded negative for ischaemic heart disease at the level of exercise attained at the time it was terminated.
A report to this effect was sent to the respondent, whose staff recorded it on the practice computer system, but no action was taken.
On 10 December 2008, R attended the surgery again, this time complaining of chest pains.
He was seen by a locum doctor, who noted typical angina pain but normal treadmill earlier in the year, but again, no action was taken.
R returned to the surgery on 15 December 2008 complaining of further chest pains.
He saw the respondent, who referred him to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic at the same hospital.
The clinic, however, declined to give him an appointment, because the earlier treadmill test had been negative.
They suggested in a report dated 20 December that if any further medical review was required R should be referred to the outpatients department.
Their report arrived at the practice on Christmas Eve, and was input into the practice computer system.
The respondent was on holiday.
The locum was on duty, but she did not review the report because it was not marked urgent.
R returned to the surgery on 6 January 2009 to find out what had happened about the referral to the clinic.
The locum told him that an appointment had been refused, but referred him to the clinic as an outpatient for a treadmill test, as suggested in the report.
He died later that day, before anything had been done to follow up this suggestion.
Mrs R complained to the Complaints Commissioner.
She gave his officials to understand that she was not looking for compensation but wished to understand what had happened.
The Commissioner agreed to undertake the investigation, and in due course reported.
He concluded that the practice had failed to provide a reasonable level of care and treatment.
In particular, he found that it was guilty of maladministration in (i) failing to take action after the treadmill test, (ii) failing to follow up promptly the clinics failure to give R an appointment, and (iii) failing to refer R to the emergency services on 6 January 2009.
He also found that the respondent had acted inappropriately after Rs death in (iv) prematurely assigning responsibility to the hospital, (v) discouraging the family from making a complaint, and (vi) having promised to contact the hospital about Mrs Rs complaint against them, failing to get back to Mrs R after doing so.
The Complaints Commissioner made no finding that these failures caused the death of R, and the facts that he has found do not suggest that they did.
He specifically found that the failure to take appropriate action on 6 January 2009 made no difference to the outcome.
But at para 70 of his report he concluded: I have identified learning points earlier in this report for the Practice and I recommend that [the GP] acts upon them.
I also recommend that the Practice should pay [the complainant] 10,000 in respect of the clearly identified failings in the care provided to [the patient] and the events which consequently followed.
The respondent has apologised to Mrs R and, as the Complaints Commissioners report observes, has put in hand changes to his practices procedures designed to avoid a recurrence of the administrative failings.
But, having taken legal advice, he has declined to pay the money sum recommended, on the ground that he was not legally bound to do so.
The Complaints Commissioner has responded by saying that in that case he was minded to issue a special report to the Northern Ireland legislature reporting the respondents failure to comply with the recommendation.
The Commissioner for Complaints (Northern Ireland) Order 1996
The Complaints Commissioner is empowered to investigate and report on complaints made to him by those claiming to have suffered injustice as a result of the conduct of certain bodies and persons.
The bodies and persons in question, and the matters which he is empowered to investigate are identified by articles 7 to 10 of the Order.
The scheme of these provisions is that article 7 provides for the investigation of complaints about maladministration by any of the bodies listed in Schedule 2.
These are all non departmental public bodies exercising functions conferred on them by statute.
Schedule 2 may be amended by Order, but article 7(3) provides that such an Order may extend its operation only to bodies which either exercise statutory functions or have their expenses substantially defrayed from public funds.
The investigation of Mrs Rs complaint against the respondent was conducted under article 8, which deals with the investigation of complaints against individuals who have undertaken to provide general medical, dental, ophthalmic or pharmaceutical services under Part VI of the Health and Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 or in certain circumstances those performing personal medical or dental services.
Unlike the bodies whose conduct may be investigated under article 7, the persons liable to be investigated under article 8 are not public bodies.
They are individuals like the respondent providing professional services under contracts or other consensual arrangements with the National Health Service.
The distinction is significant, as I shall explain. article 8(a) provides for the investigation of complaints against independent health and social care providers.
These are not public bodies either.
Like the individuals covered by article 8, they provide services under arrangements with the National Health Service.
Articles 9 and 10 restrict in certain respects the undertaking of investigations authorised under all three preceding provisions.
Article 9 is mainly concerned with the potential overlap between the Complaints Commissioners investigations and other remedies available to the complainant.
Article 9(3) and (4) provides: 9.
Matters not subject to investigation (3) Subject to paragraph (4) and to [section 78 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998], the Commissioner shall not conduct an investigation under this Order in respect of (a) any action in respect of which the person aggrieved has or had a right of appeal, complaint, reference or review to or before a tribunal constituted under any statutory provision or otherwise; any action in respect of which the person (b) aggrieved has or had a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law. (4) The Commissioner may conduct an investigation
Article 11 provides, in relation to all three categories of investigation: (a) notwithstanding that the person aggrieved has or had such a right or remedy as is mentioned in paragraph (3), if the Commissioner is satisfied that in the particular circumstances it is not reasonable to expect him to resort to or have resorted to it; or (b) notwithstanding that the person aggrieved had exercised such a right as is mentioned in paragraph (3)(a), if he complains that the injustice sustained by him remains unremedied thereby and the Commissioner is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for that complaint. 11.
Purposes of investigation The purposes of the investigation by the Commissioner shall be to ascertain if the matters alleged in the (a) complaint (i) may properly warrant investigation by him under this Order; (ii) are, in substance, true; and to effect a settlement of the matter (b) where it appears to the Commissioner to be desirable (i) complained of; or if that is not possible, to state what action (ii) should in his opinion be taken by the body concerned, the general health care provider concerned or the independent provider concerned (as the case may be) to effect a fair settlement of that matter or by that body or provider or by the person aggrieved to remove, or have removed, the cause of the complaint.
Articles 15 19 cover (among other things) enforcement.
Three modes of enforcement are provided for.
First, under article 15, the Complaints Commissioner is required to send a copy of the report of his investigation to specified people, including the complainant and the body or person investigated.
Where the investigation is carried out under article 8 into the conduct of an individual health provider, the report must be sent to the National Health Service entity with whom he or she has contracted or arranged to provide the service in question.
That body may take whatever disciplinary or other action is open to it under its arrangements with the practitioner.
Secondly, article 16 provides: 16.
Application for compensation by person aggrieved (1) Where on an investigation pursuant to a complaint under article 7 the Commissioner reports that a person aggrieved has sustained injustice in consequence of maladministration, the county court may, on an application by that person, by order award that person damages to be paid by the body concerned. (3) Damages awarded under this article shall be such as the county court may think just in all the circumstances to compensate the person aggrieved for any loss or injury which he may have suffered on account of expenses reasonably incurred by him in (a) connection with the subject matter of the maladministration on which his complaint was founded; and (b) his loss of opportunity of acquiring the benefit which he might reasonably be expected to have had but for such maladministration. (4) In calculating the amount of damages to be awarded by virtue of paragraph (3)(b) the county court shall apply the same rule concerning the duty of a person to mitigate his loss as applies in relation to damages recoverable at common law.
The third mode of enforcement is provided for by article 17.
The substance of this provision is that where the Complaints Commissioner conducts an investigation under article 7 and reports persistent or systemic maladministration, the Attorney General may, at his request, apply to the High Court for an injunction.
In court proceedings under article 16 or 17, article 18(1)(a) provides that a recommendation of the Commissioner and any report of the Commissioner relating to the complaint in connection with which the recommendation is made shall, unless the contrary is proved, be accepted as evidence of the facts stated therein.
It is, finally, necessary to refer to articles 19 and 21.
They provide as follows: 19.
Reports to the Assembly The Commissioner shall annually lay before the Assembly a general report on the performance of his functions under this Order and may from time to time lay such other reports before the Assembly as he thinks fit. 21.
Disclosure of information by Commissioner Information obtained by the Commissioner or his (1) officers in the course of, or for the purposes of, an investigation under this Order shall not be disclosed except as permitted by paragraph 1(B) or for the purposes of the investigation and any report to be made (a) thereon under this Order; (b) any proceedings for an offence under the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 alleged to have been committed in respect of information obtained by the Commissioner or any of his officers by virtue of this Order; (c) any proceedings for an offence of perjury alleged to have been committed in the course of an investigation under this Order; (d) an inquiry with a view to the taking of proceedings of the kind mentioned in sub paragraphs (b) and (c); or (e) any proceedings under article 14, 16 or 17.
Power to recommend monetary redress: Article 9(3) and (4)
On the particular facts of this case, there is a short answer to the Complaints Commissioners appeal.
Under article 9(3) of the 1996 Order, he may not carry out an investigation into any actions in respect of which the complainant has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law.
This is, subject to article 9(4), a condition precedent to his jurisdiction.
It follows, as a Divisional Court in England held about a similar provision limitation on the powers of the Commissioner for Local Administration under the Local Government Act 1974, that the operation of article 9(3) cannot depend on whether the complainants allegations are well founded.
For the purposes of article 9(3) she has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law if, on the assumption that her complaint was justified, she would have a remedy in court: see R v Commissioner for Local Administration, Ex p Croydon London Borough Council [1989] 1 All ER 1033, 1044.
By way of exception to the restriction in article 9(3), article 9(4) provides that the Complaints Commissioner may nevertheless conduct the investigation if he is satisfied that in the particular circumstances it is not reasonable to expect the complainant to resort to law.
This is primarily directed to cases where litigation would not be worth the cost and trouble involved.
But it may also apply in other cases, for example where the complainant is looking for explanations rather than money.
According to the evidence of the Commissioners staff, this was the position of Mrs R.
The Commissioner accepted that the complaint should be investigated because Mrs R said that she was not seeking monetary redress but only wanted to know what had gone wrong.
I agree that that was a proper basis on which to undertake the investigation.
The Commissioner could properly conclude that it would not have been reasonable to expect Mrs R to commence proceedings in court if she was not seeking financial relief.
But if the only basis on which the Commissioner felt able to undertake the investigation at all was that Mrs R did not want money, it could not be proper for him to recommend a payment of money and threaten to report on the respondents failure to pay it.
Power to recommend monetary redress: in general
There is, however, a more fundamental question, which is directly raised by the Court of Appeals judgment, namely whether the Complaints Commissioner has power to recommend monetary redress at all.
The Court of Appeal held that he did not.
If that is correct, it applies irrespective of the basis on which the Commissioner satisfied the conditions in article 9(4).
The starting point is the legal and constitutional status of the Complaints Commissioners reports.
The practice of the United Kingdom government is to comply with the recommendations of statutory ombudsmen unless the department in question can put forward good reasons for not doing so: see Handling of Parliamentary Ombudsman Cases (Cabinet Office, 1996), para 61, and Managing Public Money (HM Treasury, 2013), para 4.12.2.
This corresponds to what has been held to be the position of the United Kingdom government in relation to reports of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
In R (Bradley) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2008] EWCA Civ 36; [2009] QB 114, the Court of Appeal in England accepted (para 63) that where a minister was responsible to Parliament for the public body in question, he was not bound to accept the Commissioners findings or recommendations, because Parliament cannot have intended to preclude the minister from explaining his rejection of them to Parliament.
Nevertheless, it was held (para 72) that he could not rationally reject them without cogent reasons.
The decision in Bradley raises delicate questions about the relationship between judicial and Parliamentary scrutiny of a ministers rejection of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
But they are not questions which arise on this appeal, because on any view the principle stated in Bradley cannot be transposed without modification to a case where the Complaints Commissioner recommends financial redress against a medical practitioner.
In the first place, as I shall explain below, the Complaints Commissioner has a very different relationship with the legislature.
Secondly, even in a case where his recommendation is directed to a public body, article 16, which has no equivalent in the United Kingdom legislation, provides for claims to compensation to be determined in adversarial litigation before a court.
The effect is to create a statutory cause of action for maladministration which would not necessarily exist otherwise.
The function of the court is to decide the issue on the merits, and not simply by way of judicial review of the Commissioners report.
The Commissioners recommendations and findings are no more than rebuttable evidence of the facts.
It necessarily follows that the public body in question is entitled to dispute them on any ground which may find favour with a court.
Third, and critically, the recommendation which is challenged in the present case was not directed to a public body.
A general practitioner working in the National Health Service is not a public body, but merely provides services to a public body under a contract or some other consensual arrangement.
The Complaints Commissioner is not a court.
He is an official, albeit an independent one, performing an investigatory and advisory function under statute.
Except in relation to compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents (see article 13 of the 1996 Order), he has no powers of compulsion.
Subject to the terms of the practitioners agreement with the relevant NHS body and to any power of enforcement conferred by the relevant legislation, the Commissioners recommendations are not binding on any one as a matter of private law.
At best, they are legally enforceable only by virtue of the public law duty of a public body not irrationally to reject them.
But that duty is irrelevant to a person in the position of the respondent, who has no relevant public law duties.
The scheme of the 1996 Order, like that of the 1969 legislation which it replaced, is based upon a similar distinction between public and private bodies.
The right of a complainant to claim damages in court under article 16 is limited to cases of maladministration found in the course of an investigation conducted under article 7, ie by one of the public bodies to which that article applies.
The same limitation applies to the right to request the Attorney General to apply for an injunction under article 17.
Similarly, by article 21, the Complaints Commissioner is permitted to disclose information obtained in the course of or for the purpose of an investigation only for limited purposes.
They are conducting the investigation and preparing his report on it, defending himself and his officers against a charge of breach of the Official Secrets Acts, and taking proceedings for perjury or obstruction in the course of an investigation.
The information may also be made available for the purpose of enforcement proceedings under articles 16 and 17, both of which as I have pointed out are limited to investigations conducted under article 7.
Leaving aside the possibility of a special report, to which I shall return, there is no power to use the information for the purpose of enforcement measures of any other kind.
Article 11 of the 1996 Order empowers the Complaints Commissioner to try to effect a fair settlement of the complaint.
If that is not possible, he may state what action should in his opinion be taken by the object of the complaint in order to effect such a settlement.
In a case where the complainant has suffered loss in consequence of the defaults found by the Commissioner, a fair settlement is likely if not certain to require that that loss should be made good.
It follows that if the Commissioner chooses to operate the settlement procedure, and fails to achieve a settlement, he the respondent has accepted must be entitled to recommend in his report a monetary payment sufficient to bring about a fair settlement.
That power is available irrespective of the statutory basis of the investigation, and therefore whether the party investigated is a public or a private body.
But the power is not relevant here, because the Complaints Commissioner never sought to operate the settlement procedure.
If he had done, a settlement might well have been achieved without difficulty, since Mrs R had not sought monetary redress and the Commissioners other recommendations.
Article 18(1)(a) of the 1996 Order provides that the Commissioners recommendations as well as his findings may be relevant to an action for damages against a public body under article 16.
It is arguable that the Complaints Commissioner may also have power to make recommendations that would be relevant in such proceedings.
But since the respondent is not a public body and not amenable to proceedings under article 16, that question does not arise on this appeal and I should prefer to leave it open.
What is clear is that investigations under article 8 into the conduct of persons who are not public bodies are an entirely different matter.
It is one thing for a public officer performing an investigatory and advisory role to recommend a payment out of public funds.
It is another thing altogether for him to recommend the payment by a private individual out of his own pocket of a sum which that individual has no public or private law duty to pay.
Articles 16 and 17, as I have pointed out, have been deliberately limited to investigations under article 7 into the conduct of one of the public bodies identified in Schedule 2.
There is no statutory mode of enforcing a monetary payment against a private contractor to which the Complaints Commissioners recommendation could be relevant.
More generally, a private individual has no means open to him of challenging the Commissioners findings before a court, such as a public body enjoys under article 16, except by way of judicial review, which offers only limited scope for a review of the merits.
I can think of no rational reason why the draftsman of the 1996 Order should have intended that private individuals with no relevant duty of compliance should have a more limited right to challenge the Commissioners report than a public body.
On the contrary, the assumption must have been that the Commissioner would not make recommendations against private individuals of a kind which could have no legal effect directly or indirectly, either under the Order or under the general law.
This is, in substance, what the majority of the Court of Appeal decided.
In my opinion, as applied to investigations under article 8, their conclusion was correct.
Power to make a special report
The Complaints Commissioners main response to this is that his recommendations do not depend for their efficacy on their legal enforceability but on the power of publicity.
By publicising a respondents failure or refusal to comply with a recommendation, he can bring pressure to bear on him to comply notwithstanding the lack of any legal obligation to do so.
This is what the Commissioner hopes to achieve by issuing a special report.
Mr McGleenan QC, who appeared for the Commissioner before us, drew our attention to the observations of Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, 11th ed (2014), p 69, about the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967: An ombudsman requires no legal powers except powers of inquiry.
In particular, he is in no sense a court of appeal and he cannot alter or reverse any government decision.
His effectiveness derives entirely from his power to focus public and parliamentary attention upon citizens grievances.
But publicity based on impartial inquiry is a powerful lever.
Where a complaint is found to be justified an ombudsman can often persuade a government department to modify a decision or pay compensation in cases where the complainant unaided would get no satisfaction.
For the department knows that a public report will be made and that it will be unable to conceal the facts from Parliament and the press.
I have no difficulty with this proposition as applied to a public body and to the scheme of the United Kingdom Act.
The United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is an officer of the legislature.
The White Paper which preceded the passing of the 1967 Act (The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, Cmnd 1965/2767) observes at para 4, that his office was conceived as supporting the traditional constitutional function of Parliament of receiving the grievances of citizens and holding ministers individually and collectively accountable for their amendment.
The Parliamentary Commissioner in the United Kingdom is empowered to investigate complaints referred to him by a Member of Parliament against government departments and other public bodies identified in Schedule 2: see sections 4 and 5 of the 1967 Act.
He has no power to investigate complaints against private individuals providing services to government departments or public bodies.
The Parliamentary Commissioners practice is, in appropriate cases, to recommend that the department or public body provides financial redress, generally on a compensatory basis.
If the department decides not to comply, he may make a special report under section 10(3), which provides as follows: (3) If, after conducting an investigation under section 5(1) of this Act, it appears to the Commissioner that injustice has been caused to the person aggrieved in consequence of maladministration and that the injustice has not been, or will not be, remedied, he may, if he thinks fit, lay before each House of Parliament a special report upon the case.
In all of these respects, the position of the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland under the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 is the same.
Section 10(3) of the 1967 Act of the United Kingdom is reproduced by section 10(3) of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, and then by article 17(2) of the Assembly Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
But no corresponding power was conferred on the Complaints Commissioner either by the legislation of 1969 or by that of 1996.
The absence of a power in the Complaints Commissioner to make a special report of the kind which is expressly conferred on the Assembly Ombudsman was not an oversight.
It reflects a significant difference in their constitutional status.
The Assembly Ombudsman, like the United Kingdoms Parliamentary Commission for Administration, is an officer of the legislature.
Under the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, he may investigate only such complaints as are made by a member of the public to a member of the Assembly and referred by the latter to him: article 9(2).
He reports to the member in question or another appropriate member, as well as to the public body under investigation: article 16.
In keeping with this scheme, the sole mode of enforcing his recommendations provided for by the legislation is a special report to the legislature under article 17(2).
These had also been features of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.
Their effect is that the Assembly Ombudsmans recommendations are enforceable politically, but they are not enforceable legally save arguably by way of judicial review.
This reflects the fact that the bodies subject to investigation by the Assembly Ombudsman are government departments and public bodies for whom the relevant minister is responsible to the legislature.
The position of the Complaints Commissioner is different.
He is a public officer but he is not an officer of the legislature in the same sense as the Assembly Ombudsman.
Under the 1996 Order, he receives complaints directly from the public: articles 7(7) and 8(5).
He reports to the complainant and to the bodies and individuals whose conduct is at issue: article 15.
There is no power to make a special report to the legislature or to any one else on non compliance with his recommendations.
Instead, his recommendations and findings are legally enforceable by the court by the procedures set out in articles 16 and 17, but only as against public bodies investigated under article 7.
In 1969 and 1996, it was evidently not considered appropriate to confer enforcement powers against private individuals with no relevant duties either in public or private law, whether by way of resort to the courts or by denouncing the recalcitrant party to the legislature.
I do not accept the Complaints Commissioners submission that this deliberate scheme can be circumvented by resort to article 19 of the 1996 Order, which empowers him to lay before the Assembly an annual report on the performance of his functions and such other reports as he thinks fit.
Reports of his investigations are governed by article 15.
The context and the scheme of the legislation, both in 1969 and in 1996, show that article 19 is concerned with general reports on his work, and not with reports on individual cases.
The assumption of the Complaints Commissioner that he can make a special report to the legislature on a failure to comply with his recommendations confuses his two roles, which are legislatively distinct.
The position of the new Public Services Ombudsman under the 2016 Act will be different, because his power to issue a special report is wider: see section 46(2).
But that is not the legislation upon which this appeal turns.
The Commissioners recommendation in this case
I have quoted para 70 of the Commissioners report, in which he recommends a payment by the respondent of 10,000.
The respondent challenges the rationality of that recommendation.
On the view that I have reached about the limits of the Commissioners powers, this question does not arise.
However, I would not like to part with this case without commenting on the fact that the Commissioner thought it appropriate to make a recommendation in these terms, even on the footing that he was entitled to recommend monetary redress at all.
The Commissioners recommendations, in those cases where he is entitled to make them, are discretionary and he has more latitude in arriving at a figure than a court would have.
But a monetary recommendation, like any other, must be rational, and it must be explained.
The only explanation proffered is that the 10,000 should be paid in respect of the clearly identified failings in the care provided to [the patient] and the events which consequently followed.
The report does not explain why these failings warrant a payment of 10,000 or how that figure has been arrived at.
It does not say whether Mr or Mrs R suffered any loss by the failings for which the 10,000 should be treated as compensation.
Some of the failings, notably the failure to take more urgent action on 6 January 2009 are found to have made no difference and others, such as the events which followed Rs death could not in the nature of things have done so.
It is possible that the recommendation was intended as a solatium for injured feelings, but the report does not say so, and in the absence of explanation 10,000 seems to be an excessive amount to recommend on that basis.
On the face of it, the figure has simply been plucked out of the air.
If I had concluded that the Complaints Commissioner had power to recommend a payment by the respondent, I would have regarded this particular recommendation as lacking any rational basis.
Conclusion
For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.
","A patient, who was clinically asymptomatic at the time, requested that his GP refer him for a heart screen on 30 May 2008.
The GP referred him for an electrocardiogram (ECG) test in July 2008.
The test reported negative for ischaemic heart disease, and no further action was taken.
The patient made further complaints of chest pain to a locum doctor on 10 December 2008, and so his GP referred him to a chest pain clinic 5 days later.
The clinic declined to see him because of his earlier negative test, and sent a report to the practice on 20 December, which was not marked urgent or reviewed.
The patient attended the practice again on 6 January 2009 enquiring as to why he had not received an appointment.
The GP referred him for another ECG, but the patient died of a myocardial infarction later that day.
The patients widow complained to the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints (the Complaints Commissioner).
Following an investigation, the Commissioner held that the practice had failed to provide a reasonable level of care and treatment and was guilty of maladministration.
He recommended that the GP make a payment of 10,000 to the widow.
The GP refused to make the payment, and so the Commissioner indicated that he would lay a special report about the matter before the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The Commissioners recommendation was upheld at first instance but quashed by a majority of the Court of Appeal.
The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal by the Complaints Commissioner, holding that the Commissioner had (i) no power to recommend the payment of a money sum against an individual who was not a public authority in an investigation under article 8 of the Commissioner for Complaints (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 and (ii) no power to make a special report drawing the attention of the legislature to such a persons failure to comply with a recommendation.
Lord Sumption gives the judgment, with which the other Justices agree.
The Complaints Commissioners power to investigate the complaint were derived from article 8 of the Commissioner for Complaints (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, which deals with complaints against individuals, like the GP in this case, providing professional services under contracts or other consensual arrangements with the NHS [11].
The short answer to this appeal is that the Complaints Commissioner may not, under article 9 of the 1996 Order, carry out any investigations in respect of which the complainant has a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law, unless it is not reasonable to expect the complainant to resort to law.
The widow had such a remedy but the Commissioner proceeded with the investigation because she
said that she only wished to find out what had gone wrong (and not to obtain money).
It was not open to the Commissioner, having proceeded on that basis, to recommend a payment to her [17].
More generally, the Complaints Commissioner does not have the power to recommend monetary redress against individuals in investigations under article 8.
This is because his recommendations are not binding as a matter of private law, and a private individual such as a GP has no relevant duties in public law.
Furthermore, a private individual has no means of effectively challenging the Commissioners findings on the merits of the case before a court [20, 24].
Nor does the Complaints Commissioner have a power to make a special report in default of payment.
Whilst the Parliamentary Commissioner and Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland have such a power as against departments or public bodies that have been ordered to provide financial redress, the Complaints Commissioner does not.
This is because the Commissioners relationship with the legislature is different to that of other statutory ombudsmen in the United Kingdom.
The Commissioner is not an officer of the legislature, unlike the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, but receives complaints from and reports to the complainant and individuals or bodies whose conduct is at issue.
He has no powers of compulsion, and limited powers to use information discovered during investigations for the purposes of enforcement [20 21, 26 28].
Article 19 of the 1996 Order is concerned with the presentation of annual reports before the Assembly, and not reports on individual cases such as this [29].
Lord Sumption further comments on the substance of the Commissioners recommendation that the GP pay 10,000 to the widow.
A monetary recommendation must be rational and capable of explanation.
The figure in the Commissioners report appears to have been plucked out of the air: it does not offer a coherent explanation or calculation, or identify the precise failings in respect of which it was made [30].
"
uksc-2010-0154,"This case is about the employment status of individuals who are resident in Great Britain and are employed by a British company but who travel to and from home to work overseas.
Halliburton Manufacturing & Services Ltd (the appellant) is a UK company which is based at Dyce, near Aberdeen.
It is one of about 70 subsidiary or associated companies of Halliburton Inc, which is a US corporation.
It supplies tools, services and personnel to the oil industry.
The employee, Ismail Ravat (the respondent), lives in Preston, Lancashire and is a British citizen.
He was employed by the appellant from 2 April 1990 as an accounts manager until he was dismissed with effect from 17 May 2006.
The reason for his dismissal was redundancy.
The respondent complains that he was unfairly dismissed.
The complication in his case is that at the time of his dismissal he was working in Libya.
The question is whether the employment tribunal has jurisdiction to consider his complaint.
An employment tribunal sitting in Aberdeen (Mr RG Christie, sitting alone) held on 23 November 2007 that it had jurisdiction.
That decision was set aside by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (Lady Smith, sitting alone) in a judgment which was given on 14 November 2008.
The respondent appealed under section 37(1) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 to the Inner House of the Court of Session.
On 22 June 2010 an Extra Division (Lord Osborne and Lord Carloway, Lord Brodie dissenting) allowed his appeal: 2011 SLT 44.
The appellant now appeals to this court.
The question whether the respondents complaint of unfair dismissal can be heard in Scotland is, as the decisions below show, not an easy one to answer.
Section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides: An employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed.
Section 230(1) of that Act provides that employee means an individual who has entered into or works under (or, where the employment has ceased, worked under) a contract of employment.
Neither of these provisions contains any geographical limitation.
Nor is any such limitation to be found anywhere else in the Act.
As Lord Hoffmann observed in Lawson v Serco Ltd [2006] UKHL 3, [2006] ICR 250, para 1, the statement in section 244(1) that the Act extends to England and Wales and Scotland means only that it forms part of the law of Great Britain and does not form part of the law of any other territory, such as Northern Ireland (to which the subsection states the Act does not apply), for which Parliament could have legislated.
Yet it is plain that some limitation must be implied.
As Lady Hale noted in Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (No 2) [2011] UKSC 36, [2011] ICR 1312, para 5, it was agreed in that case that section 94(1) could not apply to all employment anywhere in the world.
That must indeed be so: see also Lawson, para 6, where Lord Hoffmann said that all the parties in that case were agreed that the scope of section 94(1) must have some territorial limits.
But this does not solve the problem as to where the line is to be drawn between those cases to which section 94(1) applies and those to which it does not.
It is not straightforward.
As Louise Merrett, The Extra Territorial Reach of Employment Legislation (2010) 39 Industrial Law Journal 355, has pointed out, increasing labour mobility together with the proliferation of multinational companies and groups of companies has made the international aspects of employment law important in an ever growing number of cases.
The present case is an illustration of the problems that this gives rise to.
The facts
As I have already said, the respondent was working in Libya when his employment was terminated.
From 1990 to 1995 he worked for the appellant in London.
For the remainder of the period that he was employed by it he worked overseas, initially in Algeria.
In March 2003 he was offered and accepted a transfer to Libya.
The arrangement was on what was known as a commuter or rotational basis: employment tribunals judgment, para 5.
The appellant described the respondents status in documentation attached to his employment contract as that of a UK commuter.
This was because he continued to live in Great Britain and travelled to and from his home to work for short periods overseas.
He worked for 28 consecutive days in Libya, followed by 28 consecutive days at home in Preston.
In effect he was job sharing, working back to back with another employee.
During the 28 days when he was at home the work was done in his place by another employee on the same arrangement.
His rotational work pattern was in accordance with the appellants international commuter assignment policy.
Some of its overseas employees were accorded expatriate status.
But that was not done in the respondents case because he did not live abroad full time.
His travel arrangements and costs for commuting between his home in Preston and his workplace in Libya were paid for by the appellant.
The work that the respondent carried out in Libya was for the benefit of Halliburton Co Germany GmbH, which was another subsidiary or associated company of Halliburton Inc. The German company was charged by the appellant for the respondents services.
His duties included dealing with statutory compliance in relation to tax, audits and financial control and ensuring that all day to day transactions were reported to the German company in Germany.
He reported on a daily basis to an operations manager based in Libya, but on policy and compliance issues he reported to an African Region Finance Manager, Mr Strachan, who was employed by another UK Halliburton subsidiary, Halliburton Management Ltd, based in Cairo.
On human resources his contact was with the appellants human resources department in Aberdeen and with another of its employees who was its human resources representative in Libya.
The respondent had little by way of day to day contact with the Aberdeen office while he was in Libya, and he had no formal obligation to do any work during the 28 days while he was at home.
Any duties that he performed in Great Britain, such as responding while at home to emails, were incidental to that overseas employment.
A feature of the appellants commuter policy was that while he was working on a foreign assignment the employees terms were such as to preserve the benefits, such as pay structure and pensions, for which he would normally be eligible had he been working in his home country other than those which were purely local such as a car allowance: employment tribunals judgment, para 6.
The respondent was remunerated on the normal UK pay and pension structure that applied to the appellants home based employees.
He was paid in Sterling into a UK bank account, and he paid UK income tax and national insurance on the PAYE basis.
In 2003, when he started work in Libya, the respondent was concerned to know whether his employment contract would remain governed by UK employment law: employment tribunals judgment, para 13.
He asked his manager there what his position was and was assured that he would continue to have the full protection of UK law while he worked abroad.
He was given a copy of a document in which overseas managers were told to contact the appellants human resources team in Aberdeen when they were considering action in relation to poor performance, misconduct, dismissal or redundancy.
The decision to dismiss him was taken by Mr Strachan of Halliburton Management Ltd under guidance from the Aberdeen human resources department.
The respondent then invoked the appellants UK grievance procedure, as he was advised that he was entitled to do by the human resources department.
The grievance hearing, the redundancy consultations and the respondents appeal against his dismissal all took place in the appellants offices in Aberdeen.
The respondent received a redundancy payment from the appellant.
It was stated to have been paid to him in accordance with the Employment Rights Act 1996: see section 135, which confers the right to a redundancy payment to an employee who is dismissed by the employer by reason of redundancy.
The implied limitation
The question as to what connection between Great Britain and the employment relationship was required to confer rights on employees working abroad was considered in Lawson v Serco Ltd [2006] UKHL 3, [2006] ICR 250.
Three appeals were heard together in that case, as illustrations of the situations in which the question of territorial scope might arise.
Mr Lawson was employed as a security adviser at the British RAF base on Ascension Island.
Mr Botham was employed as a youth worker at various Ministry of Defence establishments in Germany.
Mr Crofts was a pilot employed by a Hong Kong airline but was based at Heathrow.
Having been presented with these examples, the appellate committee sought to identify the principles which should be applied to give effect to what Parliament might reasonably be supposed to have intended and attributing to Parliament a rational scheme: para 23, per Lord Hoffmann.
As Lord Hoffmann, with whom all the other members of the committee agreed, observed in the final sentence of that paragraph, that involved the application of principles, not supplementary rules.
Lord Hoffmann took first what Parliament must have intended as the standard, normal or paradigm case: the employee who was working in Great Britain at the time of his dismissal: paras 25, 27.
Then there were peripatetic employees.
The former rule, which was introduced by section 22 of the Industrial Relations Act 1971, was that the right not to be unfairly dismissed did not apply to an employment where under his contract of employment the employee ordinarily works outside Great Britain.
The solution that was adopted in the application of that formula to peripatetic employees was to ask where the employee was based: Wilson v Maynard Shipbuilding Consultants AB [1978] QB 665, per Megaw LJ; Todd v British Midland Airways Ltd [1978] ICR 959, 964, per Lord Denning MR.
Adopting this approach, Lord Hoffmann said that the common sense of treating the base of a peripatetic employee as, for the purposes of the statute, his place of employment remained valid: para 29.
That dealt with the case of Mr Croft, the airline pilot, who was based at Heathrow.
This left the cases of Mr Lawson and Mr Botham, neither of whom was working in Great Britain at the time when he was dismissed.
Lord Hoffmann called them expatriate employees, and he acknowledged that the problem in their case was more difficult: para 35.
He recognised that the circumstances would have to be unusual for an employee who works and is based abroad to come within the scope of British labour legislation.
But he thought there were some who did, and that one should go further and try, without drafting a definition, to identify the characteristics which such exceptional cases will ordinarily have: para 36.
He then mentioned a number of characteristics which should be regarded as sufficient to take such cases out of the general rule that the place of employment is decisive.
It would be very unlikely that someone working abroad would be within the scope of section 94(1) unless he was working for an employer based in Great Britain.
But that would not be enough.
Something more was necessary: para 37.
He went on in paras 38 39 to give examples of cases in which section 94(1) might apply to an expatriate employee: the employee posted abroad to work for a business conducted in Great Britain, and the employee working in a political or social British enclave abroad, which were sufficient to cover the cases of Mr Lawson and Mr Botham.
In para 40 he added this comment: I do not say that there may not be others, but I have not been able to think of any and they would have to have equally strong connections with Great Britain and British employment law.
Pausing there, it is plain that it would be difficult to fit the respondents case into any of the categories identified by Lord Hoffmann in Lawson.
He was not working in Great Britain at the time of his dismissal.
He was not a peripatetic employee.
He was not working abroad as an expatriate in a political or social British enclave.
Nor had he been posted abroad to work for a business conducted in Great Britain, as he was commuting from his home in Preston and the company for whose benefit he was working in Libya was a German company.
But in Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (No 2) [2011] ICR 1312, para 8 Lady Hale sounded a salutary warning against that approach to the problem.
After summarising the principles that were to be derived from Lawson, she said: It is therefore clear that the right will only exceptionally cover employees who are working or based abroad.
The principle appears to be that the employment must have much stronger connections both with Great Britain and with British employment law than with any other system of law.
There is no hard and fast rule and it is mistake to try and torture the circumstances of one employment to make it fit one of the examples given, for they are merely examples of the application of the general principle.
One has to search quite carefully through Lord Hoffmanns speech for statements of general principle.
But they are there.
In para 1 he said: Putting the question in the traditional terms of the conflict of laws, what connection between Great Britain and the employment relationship is required to make section 94(1) the appropriate choice of law in deciding whether and in what circumstances an employee can complain that his dismissal was unfair? The answer to this question will also determine the question of jurisdiction, since the employment tribunal will have jurisdiction to decide upon the unfairness of the dismissal if (but only if) section 94(1) is the appropriate choice of law.
In para 36, having said that the circumstances would have to be unusual for an employee who works and is based abroad to come within the scope of British labour legislation but that he thought that there were some who do, he said: I hesitate to describe such cases as coming within an exception or exceptions to the general rule [that section 94(1) applies to persons employed in Great Britain] because that suggests a definition more precise than can be imposed upon the many possible combinations of factors, some of which may be unforeseen.
Mr Crow submitted that in principle the test was whether, despite the workplace being abroad, there are other relevant factors so powerful that the employment relationship has a closer connection with Great Britain than with the foreign country where the employee works.
The response that Lord Hoffmann then gave to that submission needs to be carefully noted: This may well be a correct description of the cases in which section 94(1) can exceptionally apply to an employee who works outside Great Britain, but like many accurate statements, it is framed in terms too general to be of practical help.
I would also not wish to burden tribunals with inquiry into the systems of labour law of other countries.
In my view one should go further and try, without drafting a definition, to identify the characteristics which such exceptional cases will ordinarily have.
Lord Hoffmann was dealing in that passage with those whom he had called expatriate employees.
Mr Crow appeared for the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and the Ministry of Defence, whose interest was to argue that the employment tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear Mr Bothams claim for unfair dismissal.
Lord Hoffmanns rejection of Mr Crows test as too general to be of practical help in that context, where it was possible to identify the guiding characteristics more precisely, is understandable.
But it is important not to lose sight of the fact that he acknowledged that the principle that Mr Crow had identified might well be a correct description of the cases in which section 94(1) could exceptionally apply to an employee who works outside Great Britain.
He also described it as an accurate statement.
His reasons for declining to adopt it in the case of the expatriate employees were (1) that it was framed in terms that were too general to be of practical help in their case and (2) that tribunals should not be burdened with inquiry into the systems of labour law of other countries.
But I do not see these as reasons for rejecting it in a case such as this which cannot readily be fitted into one or other of Lord Hoffmanns three categories.
Neither of the specific examples of expatriate employees given by Lord Hoffmann in Lawson applied to the employees in Duncombe.
They were teachers employed by the British Government to work in European schools abroad.
They were employed in an international enclave, not a British enclave.
But their employment had no connection with the country where they happened to work.
Also discussed in Duncombe were the cases of Wallis and Grocott, who were employed by the British government in NATO establishments in Europe where their servicemen husbands were working (Ministry of Defence v Wallis [2011] ICR 617).
The Secretary of States argument that their cases did not come within the scope of section 94(1) because they fell within neither of the cases identified as exceptional in Lawson was rejected.
In para 16 of Duncombe Lady Hale, delivering the judgment of the court, said: In our view, these cases do form another example of an exceptional case where the employment has such an overwhelmingly closer connection with Britain and with British employment law than with any other system of law that it is right to conclude that Parliament must have intended that the employees should enjoy protection from unfair dismissal.
She went on to identify what in para 17 she referred to as a very special combination of factors on which that conclusion depended.
They included the fact that the teachers and the wives were employed under contracts governed by English law, which she said must be relevant to the expectation of each party as to the protection which the employees would enjoy.
The respondents case does not fall within the further example of the expatriate employee within the scope of section 94(1) provided by Duncombe.
But Lady Hales remark in para 8 that it is a mistake to try and torture the circumstances of one employment to make it fit one of the examples given, for they are merely examples of the application of the general principle, is directly in point.
The judgment in that case was delivered on 15 July 2011, just over a year after the date when the judges of the Extra Division delivered their opinions.
Their reasoning and that of Mr Christie in the employment tribunal and Lady Smith in the Employment Appeal Tribunal was based entirely on the guidance that they took from Lord Hoffmanns speech in Lawson.
They did not have the advantage of reading Lady Hales judgment in Duncombe.
The decisions below
The differences of opinion in the employment tribunal, the EAT and the Extra Division are striking.
On the one hand, the respondents case was seen as that of an expatriate employee whose case could not be brought within Lord Hoffmanns examples of cases falling within that category.
On the other, it was seen as a case which could be resolved in the respondents favour by applying principles that can be derived from his analysis.
In the employment tribunal Mr Christie said in para 39 of his judgment that, having regard to what he took to be the general principle to be applied in the case of employees working outside Great Britain, it did not seem to him to be necessary as a first step to place any particular claimant into one or other of Lord Hoffmanns categories: Nothing which he says suggests that that is an essential.
It seems perfectly conceivable that an employee may have his place of work in another country abroad, but carries it out in a manner or in circumstances where he cannot properly be described as peripatetic or expatriate, and yet be operating in an employment relationship which has a substantial connection with the UK.
Prior to coming to this particular case, I have had in mind a British citizen who, for example, works abroad on what is often referred to as a rotational system of working, say, four weeks in Africa followed by three weeks on leave at home with his family in, say, Edinburgh and so on, following the pattern.
He referred in the next paragraph, by way of analogy, to the oil rig worker who was flown out to the Continental Shelf to work for two weeks and was then flown back to stay at home in, say, Dundee for the next two weeks.
He did not become peripatetic merely because the rig he might be transferred to was in the Norwegian sector or was off the coast of West Africa.
Having examined all the circumstances peculiar to this case, he concluded in para 54 of his judgment that there remained a sufficiently substantial connection between the employment relationship and Great Britain to enable him to hold that the tribunal had jurisdiction.
In the Employment Appeal Tribunal Lady Smith said in para 14 of her judgment that she took from Lord Hoffmanns judgment that the fact that an employee was recruited by a British company in Great Britain to work for it abroad would not, in itself, be enough for jurisdiction.
She referred to the principle identified by him in para 1 of his speech for the appropriateness of recognising jurisdiction in each case (see para 14, above).
She then examined what she referred to as his discussion of the different categories into which a persons employment could fall in a case where the jurisdiction question arises.
In para 18 she noted that in his discussion of the expatriate category Lord Hoffmann did not approve of a test of substantial connection.
On the contrary, he was saying that it was not enough.
In para 35 she said that she was satisfied that the tribunal erred in law: It applied a test of substantial connection with Great Britain and should not have done so.
A test of substantial connection falls far short of the criteria inherent in the principles identified by Lord Hoffmann, to which principles I have already referred.
It also took account of the proper law of the parties contract and the reassurances given to the claimant by the respondents about the availability to him of UK employment law, neither of which was relevant.
In paras 37 38 she said that the respondent fell plainly within Lord Hoffmanns third category the expatriate category, and that, far from there being something more to show that it was appropriate that there should be jurisdiction, there was something less.
The respondent was not working for the appellants business at home, but was working in the operation of a German company and was dismissed by an employee who had his work base in Cairo.
In the Extra Division Lord Osborne said in para 15 that he took from Lord Hoffmanns reference to an employee who works and is based abroad when dealing with what he termed expatriate employees that he meant someone whose place of work and base, which included his place of residence, was situated in a foreign country.
Referring to the passage in para 40 of Lord Hoffmanns speech, where he said that he could not think of any other examples of expatriate employees to whom section 94(1) might apply but that they would have to have equally strong connections with Great Britain and with British employment law (see para 12, above), he said: Since, in my view, the respondent cannot properly be seen as an expatriate employee, this particular observation is not of direct relevance to his situation.
However, I consider that what is said comes, perhaps, as close as anything in this judgment to an indication of the kind of connection with Great Britain and British employment law that an employee would require to show to be able to invoke successfully the jurisdiction of an employment tribunal in connection with a claim based upon section 94(1).
Thus, the reference to strong connections with Great Britain and British employment law seems to me to be important.
In para 16 of his opinion Lord Osborne said that it was not necessary for a claimant to demonstrate that he might properly be placed in one of the categories considered in detail by Lord Hoffmann.
An employee might have a place of work in a foreign country but carry it out in a manner and in circumstances in which he could not properly be described as peripatetic or expatriate.
In para 19 he said that it was not possible, without qualification, to affirm the decision of the employment tribunal as words used by the chairman suggested that he considered that the task that he was undertaking was the exercise of a discretion.
Lord Hoffmann had made it clear in para 24 of his speech in Lawson that it was a question of law, although involving judgment in the application of the law to the facts.
But Lord Osborne concluded in para 20 that the tribunal ultimately reached a correct conclusion on the facts.
Lord Carloway said in para 27 that, as he read Lord Hoffmanns speech, he was setting out three definitive categories of employment, into which every person is capable of being squeezed.
In para 29 he said that an expatriate employee is one who lives and works abroad.
That did not apply to the respondent, who had his home in England.
In para 30 he indicated that he saw the respondent as more peripatetic than expatriate, as these words were used by Lord Hoffmann.
But he went on to ask himself a broader question.
This was whether, notwithstanding the foreign elements, Parliament intended section 94(1) to apply to someone in the respondents circumstances whose employer did not regard him as an expatriate but as a commuter and dealt with all his contractual entitlements in Dyce.
He answered that question in the affirmative.
Lord Brodie, who dissented, said in paras 54 55 that in his opinion there was no question but that the respondent fell into Lord Hoffmanns expatriate employee category, that living arrangements did not comprise a necessary element in any of them and that he did not see the respondent as falling within the exceptional cases of persons working abroad that he had identified.
Discussion
I have set out the reasoning in the judgments below at some length because it shows that, as Mr Christie observed in para 38 of his judgment in the employment tribunal, Lord Hoffmanns analysis in Lawson did not have the effect of eliminating uncertainty and that those who have been looking to it for guidance have found it difficult to apply.
Mr Christies complaint was that it seemed to remain a very open question as to what exactly amounts to a sufficient or sufficiently substantial connection with Great Britain, and that there was little by way of guidance which employment tribunals might grasp to assist in what test they are to apply or how to go about their task.
Lady Hales comment in Duncombe, para 8, that there is no hard and fast rule and that it is a mistake to try and torture the circumstances of one employment to make it fit one of the examples given, for they are merely examples of the application of the general principle, will have gone a long way to address this problem.
But Mr Cavanagh QC for the appellant described this case as much more mainstream because it will cover a much larger class of employees than any one of Lord Hoffmanns categories.
The problem that it raises must be resolved by applying the relevant guiding principles to the facts described in the employment tribunals judgment.
As I have already indicated (see para 14, above), it is possible on a careful reading of Lord Hoffmanns speech in Lawson to find what he saw as the guiding principles.
The question in each case is whether section 94(1) applies to the particular case, notwithstanding its foreign elements.
Parliament cannot be taken to have intended to confer rights on employees having no connection with Great Britain at all.
The paradigm case for the application of the subsection is, of course, the employee who was working in Great Britain.
But there is some scope for a wider interpretation, as the language of section 94(1) does not confine its application to employment in Great Britain.
The constraints imposed by the previous legislation, by which it was declared that the right not to be unfairly dismissed did not apply to any employment where under his contract of employment the employee ordinarily worked outside Great Britain, have been removed.
It is not for the courts to lay down a series of fixed rules where Parliament has decided, when consolidating with amendments the previous legislation, not to do so.
They have a different task.
It is to give effect to what Parliament may reasonably be taken to have intended by identifying, and applying, the relevant principles.
Mr Cavanagh drew attention to Lord Hoffmanns comment in Lawson, para 37, that the fact that the relationship was rooted and forged in Great Britain because the respondent happened to be British and he was recruited in Great Britain by a British company ought not to be sufficient in itself to take the case out of the general rule.
Those factors will never be unimportant, but I agree that the starting point needs to be more precisely identified.
It is that the employment relationship must have a stronger connection with Great Britain than with the foreign country where the employee works.
The general rule is that the place of employment is decisive.
But it is not an absolute rule.
The open ended language of section 94(1) leaves room for some exceptions where the connection with Great Britain is sufficiently strong to show that this can be justified.
The case of the peripatetic employee who was based in Great Britain is one example.
The expatriate employee, all of whose services were performed abroad but who had nevertheless very close connections with Great Britain because of the nature and circumstances of employment, is another.
The reason why an exception can be made in those cases is that the connection between Great Britain and the employment relationship is sufficiently strong to enable it to be presumed that, although they were working abroad, Parliament must have intended that section 94(1) should apply to them.
The expatriate cases that Lord Hoffmann identified as falling within its scope were referred to by him as exceptional cases: para 36.
This was because, as he said in para 36, the circumstances would have to be unusual for an employee who works and is based abroad to come within the scope of British labour legislation.
It will always be a question of fact and degree as to whether the connection is sufficiently strong to overcome the general rule that the place of employment is decisive.
The case of those who are truly expatriate because they not only work but also live outside Great Britain requires an especially strong connection with Great Britain and British employment law before an exception can be made for them.
But it does not follow that the connection that must be shown in the case of those who are not truly expatriate, because they were not both working and living overseas, must achieve the high standard that would enable one to say that their case was exceptional.
The question whether, on given facts, a case falls within the scope of section 94(1) is a question of law, but it is also a question of degree.
The fact that the commuter has his home in Great Britain, with all the consequences that flow from this for the terms and conditions of his employment, makes the burden in his case of showing that there was a sufficient connection less onerous.
Mr Cavanagh said that a rigorous standard should be applied, but I would not express the test in those terms.
The question of law is whether section 94 (1) applies to this particular employment.
The question of fact is whether the connection between the circumstances of the employment and Great Britain and with British employment law was sufficiently strong to enable it to be said that it would be appropriate for the employee to have a claim for unfair dismissal in Great Britain.
The respondent's case
It is true that at the time of his dismissal the respondent was working in Libya and that the operations that were being conducted there and in which he worked were those of a different Halliburton associated company which was incorporated and based in Germany.
It is true also that the decision to dismiss him was taken by Mr Strachan who was based in Cairo.
But I would not attach as much importance to these details as I would have done if the company for which the respondent was working in Libya was not another associated Halliburton company.
The vehicles which a multinational corporation uses to conduct its business across international boundaries depend on a variety of factors which may deflect attention from the reality of the situation in which the employee finds himself.
As Mr Christie said in the employment tribunal, it is notorious that the employees of one company within the group may waft to another without alteration to their essential function in pursuit of the common corporate purpose: para 53.
All the other factors point towards Great Britain as the place with which, in comparison with any other, the respondents employment had the closer connection.
The appellants business was based in Great Britain.
It was to provide tools, services and personnel to the oil industry.
That was why it sent the respondent to Libya, even though the actual work itself was in the furtherance of the business of another Halliburton subsidiary or associate company: see the employment tribunals judgment, para 53.
It chose to treat him as a commuter for this purpose, with a rotational working pattern familiar to workers elsewhere in the oil industry which enables them to spend an equivalent amount of time at home in Great Britain as that spent offshore or overseas.
In the respondents case this meant that all the benefits for which he would have been eligible had he been working in Great Britain were preserved for him.
Lady Smith said in the EAT that the employment tribunal was wrong to take account of the proper law of the parties contract and the reassurance given to the respondent by the appellant about the availability to him of UK employment law, as neither of them were relevant.
The better view, I think, is that, while neither of these things can be regarded as determinative, they are nevertheless relevant.
Of course, it was not open to the parties to contract in to the jurisdiction of the employment tribunal.
As Mr Cavanagh put it, the parties cannot alter the statutory reach of section 94(1) by an estoppel based on what they agreed to.
The question whether the tribunal has jurisdiction will always depend on whether it can be held that Parliament can reasonably be taken to have intended that an employee in the claimants position should have the right to take his claim to an employment tribunal.
But, as this is a question of fact and degree, factors such as any assurance that the employer may have given to the employee and the way the employment relationship is then handled in practice must play a part in the assessment.
The assurances that were given in the respondents case were made in response to his understandable concern that his position under British employment law might be compromised by his assignment to Libya.
The documentation he was given indicated that it was the appellants intention that the relationship should be governed by British employment law.
This was borne out in practice, as matters relating to the termination of his employment were handled by the appellants human resources department in Aberdeen.
This all fits into a pattern, which points quite strongly to British employment law as the system with which his employment had the closest connection.
Mr Cavanagh submitted that the fact that the respondents home was in Great Britain was of no relevance.
Why, he said, should the place where you are living when you are not working be relevant at all? All that mattered was the place where he was working.
His place of residence did not matter, and it should be left out of account.
It is true that his place of work was in Libya and not in Preston.
But the fact that his home was in Great Britain cannot be dismissed as irrelevant.
It was the reason why he was given the status of a commuter, with all the benefits that were attached to it which, as he made clear, he did not want to be prejudiced by his assignment.
Here too the fact that his home was in Preston fits in to a pattern which had a very real bearing on the parties employment relationship.
As the question is ultimately one of degree, considerable respect must be given to the decision of the employment tribunal as the primary fact finder.
Mr Christie said in para 54 of his judgment that his conclusion that the balance was in favour of the respondent fell within the band of reasonable responses available to a reasonable chairman of employment tribunals.
This remark was seen by both Lady Smith in para 36 of her judgment in the EAT and by Lord Osborne in the Extra Division, 2011 SLT 44, para 19 as an indication that he considered the task that he was undertaking as the exercise of a discretion.
His remark was perhaps not very well chosen, but I do not think that his judgment when read as a whole is open to this criticism.
The test which he applied was whether there was a substantial connection with Great Britain: see paras 39 and 47.
It would have been better if he had asked himself whether the connection was sufficiently strong to enable it to be said that Parliament would have regarded it as appropriate for the tribunal to deal with the claim: see para 29, above.
But I think that it is plain from his reasoning that he would have reached the same conclusion if he had applied that test.
Lord Osborne said in para 20 of his opinion that the tribunal reached a conclusion that it was entitled to reach and that it was a correct conclusion.
I agree with that assessment.
So I too would hold that section 94(1) must be interpreted as applying to the respondents employment, and that the employment tribunal has jurisdiction to hear his claim.
Conclusion
I would dismiss the appeal.
I would also affirm the Extra Divisions
interlocutor, the effect of which is that the case will be remitted to the employment tribunal to deal with the merits of the respondents claim that he was dismissed unfairly.
","The issue in this case is whether an employment tribunal has jurisdiction in relation to individuals who are resident in Great Britain and employed by a British company but who travel to and from home to work overseas.
The Appellant is a UK company based near Aberdeen, which is one of about 70 subsidiary or associated companies of Halliburton Inc., a US corporation.
It supplies tools, services and personnel to the oil industry.
Mr Ravat lives in Preston, Lancashire, and is a British citizen.
He was employed by the Appellant from April 1990 until May 2006, when he was made redundant.
He complains that he was unfairly dismissed.
At the time of his dismissal he was working in Libya.
The question is whether the employment tribunal has jurisdiction to consider his complaint.
Mr Ravats employment documentation described him as a UK commuter.
He worked for 28 consecutive days in Libya, followed by 28 consecutive days off at home in Preston.
He was job sharing, working back to back with another employee.
Some of the Appellants employees were accorded expatriate status, but that was not done in Mr Ravats case because he did not live abroad full time.
His travel costs were paid for by the Appellant.
The work that Mr Ravat carried out in Libya was for the benefit of a German associated company of Halliburton Inc. His salary was paid in Sterling to a UK bank account, and he paid income tax and national insurance on the PAYE basis.
An employment tribunal sitting in Aberdeen held that it did have jurisdiction.
That decision was set aside by the Employment Appeal Tribunal.
Mr Ravat appealed, and the Inner House of the Court of Session allowed the appeal.
The Appellant now appeals to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal and remits the case to the employment tribunal to deal with the merits of the respondents claim that he was dismissed unfairly.
The judgment is given by Lord Hope.
Section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 sets out the right of the employee not to be unfairly dismissed and section 230(1) sets out the definition of employee.
They do not contain any geographical limitation, nor is any such limitation to be found anywhere else in the Act [3].
Yet it is plain that some limitation must be implied: section 94(1) cannot apply to all employment anywhere in the world [4].
In Lawson v Serco Ltd [2006] UKHL 3, Lord Hoffmann identified three categories of employees who would fall within the jurisdiction of the employment tribunal: employees working in Great Britain; peripatetic employees where the employee is based in Great Britain; and, in some exceptional cases, expatriate employees [9 12].
But it would be difficult to fit Mr Ravats case into any of Lord
Hoffmanns categories [13].
The problem that it raises must be resolved by applying the relevant guiding principles to the facts described in the employment tribunals judgment [25].
The question in each case is whether section 94(1) applied to the particular case, notwithstanding its foreign elements.
It is not for the courts to lay down a series of fixed rules where Parliament has decided not to do so.
Their role is rather to give effect to what Parliament may reasonably be taken to have intended by identifying and applying the relevant principles [26].
The starting point is that the employment relationship must have a stronger connection with Great Britain than with the foreign country where the employee works.
The general rule is that the place of employment is decisive, but that is not an absolute rule [27].
In some cases, an exception can be made because the connection between Great Britain and the employment relationship is sufficiently strong to enable it to be presumed that, although they were working abroad, Parliament must have intended that section 94(1) should apply to them.
It will always be a question of fact and degree as to whether the connection is sufficiently strong to overcome the general rule that the place of employment is decisive.
The case of those who are truly expatriate because they not only work but also live outside Great Britain requires an especially strong connection with Great Britain and British employment law before an exception can be made for them [28].
But it does not follow that the connection that must be shown in the case of those who are not truly expatriate, because they are not both working and living overseas, must achieve the high standard that would enable one to say that their case was exceptional.
In this case, the fact that the commuter has his home in Great Britain, with all the consequences that flow from this for the terms and conditions of his employment, makes the burden in his case of showing that there was a sufficient connection less onerous.
The question of law is whether section 94(1) applies to this particular employment.
The question of fact is whether the connection between the circumstances of the employment and Great Britain and with British employment law was sufficiently strong to enable it to be said that it would be appropriate for the employee to have a claim for unfair dismissal in Great Britain [29].
In this case, Mr Ravat was working in Libya, for a different Halliburton associated company which was based in Germany, and the decision to dismiss him was taken by an individual based in Cairo.
But all the other factors point towards Great Britain as the place with which, in comparison with any other, Mr Ravats employment had the closer connection [30].
The Appellants business was based in Great Britain.
It treated Mr Ravat as a commuter, which meant that all the benefits for which he would have been eligible had he been working in Great Britain were preserved for him [31].
Although it was not open to the parties to contract in to the jurisdiction of the employment tribunal, factors such as any assurance that the employer may have given to the employee regarding the applicability of UK employment law, and the way the employment relationship is then handled in practice must play a part in the overall assessment [32].
On being assigned to Libya, Mr Ravat was assured that UK employment law would apply to his contract.
The documentation he received reflected this, and in fact matters relating to the termination of his employment were handled by the Appellants human resources department in Aberdeen [33 34].
As the question is ultimately one of degree, considerable respect must be given to the decision of the employment tribunal as the primary fact finder.
In the circumstances of this case, section 94(1) must be interpreted as applying to Mr Ravats employment, and the employment tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to hear his claim [35].
"
uksc-2017-0073,"The appellant, Nottingham City Council (Nottingham), is the licensing authority for those houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) in its district which are licensable under Part 2, Housing Act 2004.
This appeal concerns two HMOs, namely 44, Rothesay Avenue, Lenton, Nottingham NG7 1PU and 50, Bute Avenue, Lenton, Nottingham NG7 1QA.
Both are owned by the second respondent, Trevor Parr Associates Ltd, which carries on the business of providing accommodation for students.
The first respondent Dominic Parr is the managing director of the second respondent and the manager of the properties.
Nottingham appeals against the decision of the Court of Appeal dated 29 March 2017, dismissing its appeal against the decision of the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) dated 9 February 2016, dismissing its appeals against decisions of the First tier Tribunal dated 5 November 2014 (44, Rothesay Avenue) and 6 May 2015 (50, Bute Avenue) respectively, allowing the respondents appeal against the imposition by Nottingham of certain HMO licensing conditions.
On this appeal to the Supreme Court the respondents have not appeared and have not been represented.
In these circumstances, at the request of the Court an Advocate to the Court was appointed in order to argue the grounds for resisting the present appeal and we are grateful to Mr Martin Chamberlain QC for performing this role.
In addition, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government (the Secretary of State) has intervened in this appeal.
We are grateful to all counsel for their submissions.
Legislation
The Housing Act 2004, Part 2 replaced the previous law on HMOs which was to be found in the Housing Act 1985, Part XI (the 1985 Act).
The 1985 Act defined an HMO as a house which is occupied by persons who do not form a single household but left the word household undefined.
In Barnes v Sheffield City Council (1995) 27 HLR 719 the Court of Appeal set out a number of factors relevant to determining whether occupants were living together as a single household.
It held that in the particular circumstances of that case a group of students sharing a house constituted a single household.
The 1999 consultation paper, Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation England (DETR, 1999), which preceded the 2004 Act observed (section 2, para 24) that, as a result of this judgment, housing authorities were wary of attempting to use their HMO powers in shared houses, particularly those occupied by students.
The 2004 Act was intended, inter alia, to extend the regulatory scheme of HMOs to include shared student accommodation, subject to certain exceptions.
The 2004 Act introduced for the first time a system of licensing of HMOs authorising occupation of the house concerned by not more than a maximum number of households or persons specified in the licence (section 61(2)).
A building or part of a building will qualify as an HMO if the living accommodation is occupied by persons who do not form a single household (section 254(2)(b), (3) and 4(c)) and if occupied by those persons as their only or main residence or they are to be treated as so occupying it (section 254(2)(c), (3) and 4(d)).
Section 258 makes provision for determining when persons are to be regarded as not forming a single household for the purposes of section 254.
They are to be so regarded unless they are members of the same family or their circumstances are of a description specified in regulations (section 258(2)).
Such provision is made in the Licensing and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation and Other Houses (Miscellaneous Provisions) (England) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/373) (the 2006 Regulations).
Section 259 makes provision for determining when persons should be treated as occupying premises as their only or main residence.
In particular, a person is to be so treated, inter alia, if premises are occupied by the person as the persons residence for the purpose of undertaking a full time course of further or higher education (section 259(2)(a)).
If an application for a licence is made to the local housing authority, it may grant a licence if it is satisfied as to the matters mentioned in section 64(3).
Those requirements include that the house is reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons [specified in the application or decided by the authority] or that it can be made so suitable by the imposition of conditions under section 67 (section 64(1), (2), (3)(a)).
Section 67 provides in material part: 67 Licence conditions (1) A licence may include such conditions as the local housing authority consider appropriate for regulating all or any of the following the management, use and occupation of the house (a) concerned, and (b) its condition and contents. (2) Those conditions may, in particular, include (so far as appropriate in the circumstances) (a) conditions imposing restrictions or prohibitions on the use or occupation of particular parts of the house by persons occupying it; (5) A licence may not include conditions imposing restrictions or obligations on a particular person other than the licence holder unless that person has consented to the imposition of the restrictions or obligations. (6) A licence may not include conditions requiring (or intended to secure) any alteration in the terms of any tenancy or licence under which any person occupies the house.
Guidance
At the material time, minimum sizes of bedrooms in HMOs were not prescribed in legislation.
However, Nottingham issues guidance to its housing officers on the operation of this licensing system.
For present purposes the relevant document is HMO Amenity Guidance 3 Space Provision for Licensable and Non Licensable HMOs.
This states that in the case of bedrooms in single occupation in HMOs where there is adequate dining space elsewhere and where cooking facilities are not provided in the room the minimum space provision is eight square metres.
A general note adds: The dimensions and areas specified shall normally be regarded as the minimum, particularly with regard to new proposals.
However it is recognised that existing buildings cannot always achieve these minima.
A degree of flexibility will sometimes be possible if other compensating features are present.
Conversely it should be noted that irrespective of the dimensions, the shape and useable living space of any room is a determining factor in the calculation of the maximum number of people for which it is suitable.
In carrying out its measurements Nottingham disregards all space with a floor to ceiling height of less than 1.53 metres.
Nottingham participates with other housing authorities in the East Midlands in an organisation named East Midlands Decent and Safe Homes which also sets out amenity standards for HMOs in Amenity and Space in HMOs: A Landlords Guide (the East Midlands DASH Guide).
This recommends adopting eight square metres as the minimum size for bedrooms of this sort but also states: The standards are usually regarded as a MINIMUM but are a guide only.
Other factors or compensatory features will be taken into account when inspecting a property, therefore allowing for a degree of flexibility in certain circumstances.
These factors could include the shape of the usable living space, or the needs and wishes of the occupants. (Original emphasis)
The properties
44, Rothesay Avenue and 50, Bute Avenue are both terraced houses of traditional brick construction with a slate roof.
Both are used for letting to students and in each case the attics have been converted into bedrooms.
In each property the front attic bedroom has a sloping ceiling which reduces the area regarded by Nottingham as useable living space below eight square metres.
At 44, Rothesay Avenue the front attic room has a total floor area of 9.75 square metres but, due to the sloping ceiling, only 5.89 square metres has a floor to ceiling height of 1.53 metres or more.
The front attic room at 50, Bute Avenue has a floor area of approximately 11 square metres of which only 6.89 square metres has a floor to ceiling height of 1.53 metres or more.
Both the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal quoted the following description of the attic bedroom at 44, Rothesay Avenue by the First tier Tribunal: The area of the relevant bedroom having a height of less than 1.53m was utilised to accommodate a desk and for storage.
The relevant room includes a double bed, desk, chest of drawers, bedside table, bookshelves and a built in wardrobe.
The pitch of the roof slope was such that it appeared possible to use the desk without undue risk of collision and any such risk could be reduced further by placing the chair in the area beneath the pitched roof window thereby eliminating the risk of collision when rising from the chair.
The head of the bed was fitted under that part of the room with reduced height.
Risk of collision could be avoided by turning the bed through 180.
The risk of collision when changing the bed linen could be avoided by pulling the bed out of the area with reduced headroom prior to performing the task.
The assessment of the attic bedroom at 50, Bute Avenue was to similar effect.
Nottinghams decisions and the appeals
In each case Nottingham granted a new HMO licence which imposed a condition prohibiting the use of the attic bedroom for sleeping.
The licence for 44, Rothesay Avenue provided: [T]he second floor front bedroom be prohibited for the use of sleeping.
This room will not be allowed for the use for sleeping until it has provided by way of alteration, adaptation or extension a useable floor surface area of eight square metres within a minimum ceiling height of 1.53 metres below the sloping ceiling from the floor. (para 36) The licence for 50, Bute Avenue limited the number of persons permitted to occupy the HMO to a maximum of five and provided: The second floor front bedroom is not to be used as a sleeping room, except where it is let in combination with another room within the property in such a way as to provide the occupant with the exclusive use of two rooms. (para 38) This licence further provided that the restriction on sleeping in the room might be removed if alterations were carried out to increase the size of the room to eight square metres (excluding any area where the ceiling height is below 1.53m).
In each case the respondents appealed to the First tier Tribunal against the imposition of these conditions.
Each of the First tier Tribunals referred in its decision to the guidance issued by Nottingham and, in particular, to the general note quoted at para 7 above.
Each considered that Nottinghams guidance on space provision was reasonable as general guidance but noted that some flexibility was permitted if other compensating features were present.
Each considered that in each of the rooms the area with the reduced headroom was of some value for the uses described.
Furthermore, each considered that in each of the HMOs the provision of communal living space was significantly larger than the minimum contemplated by Nottinghams requirements for additional living space.
In each case the Tribunal regarded this over provision as a compensating feature which could be taken into account in applying Nottinghams own guidance.
In each case the Tribunal concluded that the attic rooms were adequate as study/bedrooms where cohesive living is envisaged and that there were sufficient compensating features in the HMOs to make them suitable for student or similar cohesive occupation for six persons in six households.
Accordingly, in the licence for 44, Rothesay Avenue the First tier Tribunal substituted an alternative condition, namely that: The second floor front bedroom may only be used for sleeping accommodation by a person engaged in full time education and who resides in the dwelling for a maximum period of ten calendar months over a period of one year.
No similar condition was introduced by the First tier Tribunal which heard the appeal in relation to 50, Bute Avenue, but it justified its conclusion by stating that there are sufficient compensating features in the property to make it suitable for students or similar cohesive occupation for six persons in six households.
In dismissing Nottinghams further appeal in that case, however, the Upper Tribunal directed that the same condition be included in the licence for 50, Bute Avenue.
On appeal to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) both appeals were dismissed.
Martin Rodger QC, Deputy President, referred to examples of guidance by local housing authorities modifying space standards for particular modes of occupation which, he considered, recognise that certain categories of occupier may wish to occupy accommodation in a particular way.
The purpose of all conditions under section 67 was to ensure that the HMO is suitable for the number of persons permitted to occupy it and there was therefore nothing unlawful in formulating a condition applicable to a particular mode of occupation by a category of occupants if the house was suitable for them in greater numbers than it would be for a different mode of occupation.
He rejected Nottinghams submission that the Act requires that an HMO must be capable of occupation by all potential occupants.
Referring to the substituted condition in the case of 44, Rothesay Avenue, he observed that the condition was formulated on the basis that the property was one where cohesive living is envisaged and that by cohesive living the First tier Tribunal clearly had in mind the level of shared activity and social interaction to be expected in a shared house or Category B HMO, as described at greater length in the policy documents of other local authorities.
In his view, the basic idea of a house shared by a number of individuals, not forming a family but who nevertheless wish to share communal living facilities and enjoy a significant level of social interaction, is readily understood.
With regard to the terms of the condition he observed: I am satisfied that there is nothing unlawful in a condition restricting the use of sleeping accommodation in part of an HMO to a person in full time education, if the decision maker is satisfied that, looked at as a whole, the HMO is suitable for the number of households specified in the licence.
An alternative condition, perhaps more closely reflecting the reason for permitting the use of a room smaller than would normally be acceptable, might require that the occupiers be members of a group who intend to share the communal living space, but I do not think the reference to students makes the condition unlawful.
The Court of Appeal (Longmore, Lewison and Briggs LJJ) upheld the decision of the Upper Tribunal: [2017] PTSR 879.
The Court of Appeal considered that the power to impose conditions permitted a condition defined by reference to the general characteristics and activities of an occupier.
A restriction of occupation to occupation by students was a restriction on occupation by persons.
The Court of Appeal rejected submissions that the condition imposed by the First tier Tribunal was irrational and incapable of effective enforcement.
However, it varied the licences to include two further conditions: that the communal space on the ground floor, (i) comprising a kitchen/diner and living room area, be kept available for communal living space only; (ii) students engaged in full time education.
that no bedrooms may be let to persons other than
Nottingham now appeals to the Supreme Court, by leave granted by this Court, on the following grounds: Ground 1: The power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67, Housing Act 2004, in order to make an HMO suitable for a particular number of households or persons, cannot be used so as to limit the class of persons for whom the HMO is suitable.
Ground 2: The conditions imposed by the Tribunals and Court of Appeal are irrational and unenforceable.
Ground 1
Submissions of the parties
On behalf of Nottingham, Mr Andrew Arden QC submits that the conditions imposed seek to make an exception for full time students otherwise than in the circumstances permitted by the legislation.
Section 64(3)(a) requires the authority to be satisfied that the house is reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons mentioned in subsection (4) or that it can be made so suitable by the imposition of conditions under section 67.
In his submission the legislation, at this stage, is unequivocal and concerned only with numbers.
Furthermore, section 67(2)(a) which permits conditions imposing restrictions or prohibitions on the use or occupation of particular parts of the house by persons occupying it does not permit conditions restricting who may occupy an HMO.
The references elsewhere in the statute to the characteristics of occupants do not support setting conditions by reference to such characteristics.
In the alternative, the proposed conditions here seek, contrary to the policy of the legislation, to introduce an exception to its operation for a category of persons or a defined set of circumstances.
A condition which restricts the occupation of an HMO by reference to a class of occupier does not achieve the purpose of improving or maintaining standards and has the effect of making accommodation unavailable to a section of the rental market.
That standards may be lowered for certain categories otherwise than as specified by Parliament is the antithesis of the legislative purpose.
In the further alternative, treating occupation by students in this way is contrary to the statutory object of Part 2 of the 2004 Act which was intended in part to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal in Barnes v Sheffield City Council.
On behalf of the Secretary of State Mr Jonathan Moffett QC accepts that, in an appropriate case, section 67 does empower a housing authority to impose a condition on a licence which restricts the occupation of all or part of an HMO to occupation by a particular class of person.
However, he submits that a housing authority may not, on the basis of such a condition, grant a licence for an HMO which authorises the HMO to be occupied by a greater number of households or persons than the authority would otherwise authorise.
In particular, he criticises the approach of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that it allows for the application of different standards for different classes of person and assumes that a particular class of occupier will live in the HMO in a way that requires a lower standard of accommodation than other classes.
He submits that section 64(3)(a) refers to conditions that make the house reasonably suitable for occupation by the maximum number of households or persons and does not refer to conditions that make the households or persons suitable to occupy the house.
Mr Chamberlain, as Advocate to the Court, has at the Courts request advanced the submissions which might have been made by the respondents had they taken part in this further appeal.
He submits that section 67 permits the imposition of the conditions in question here.
First, he submits that the conditions imposed on the letting of each of the properties were, on their face, conditions regulating the use of the second floor front bedroom and were correctly characterised as such.
However, Parliament chose to permit conditions regulating management, use and occupation of an HMO.
On a natural reading, a condition regulating the occupation of a house is apt to include one that governs how or by whom it may be occupied.
Contrary to the submissions of Nottingham, the Court of Appeal decision does not introduce an exception to the operation of the legislation for a category of persons or a defined set of circumstances, nor does it allow occupation at a lower standard than would otherwise have been permitted in the circumstance of the HMOs in question.
Discussion
Section 64(3)(a) indicates that the purpose of the imposition of conditions is to make a house reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons specified in the application or decided by the housing authority.
The question as to what sort of conditions may be imposed is governed by section 67.
Section 67(1)(a) provides that a licence may include such conditions as the local housing authority considers appropriate for regulating all or any of the management, use and occupation of the house concerned.
Section 67(1) is followed in section 67(2) by a non exhaustive list of permitted conditions including in section 67(2)(a) conditions imposing restrictions or prohibitions on the use or occupation of particular parts of the house by persons occupying it.
Considering these words in their natural meaning, they extend sufficiently widely to include the conditions with which we are concerned.
I am persuaded that the words use and occupation in section 67(1) are not used as a composite term.
Section 67(2)(a) refers disjunctively to the use or occupation of particular parts of the house.
The inclusion of occupation in addition to use must have been intended to extend the scope of permissible conditions.
It may well be, as Mr Chamberlain submits, that the conditions in respect of each of these houses related to the use of the attic bedrooms.
However, it seems clear that they relate to the occupation of those rooms.
As Mr Chamberlain put it, on a natural reading a condition regulating the occupation of a house is apt to include one that governs how or by whom it may be occupied.
In my view, these conditions seek to regulate the occupation of particular parts of the house by persons occupying it and fall squarely within the natural meaning of section 67(2)(a).
It is, however, necessary to stand back from the plain meaning of these provisions and to consider whether such a reading is consistent with the object of the legislation.
In this regard it is significant that elsewhere in Part 2 of the 2004 Act the manner of occupation of a house and the general characteristics of occupants are considered relevant in contexts connected with HMOs and with housing standards generally.
In some instances, the personal occupation or activities of an occupier will have a bearing on whether the legislation applies.
Thus, for example, persons carrying out domestic services are regarded as occupying the same household as their employer if they are occupying rent free tied accommodation in the same building (2006 Regulations, regulation 3); a full time student is regarded as occupying accommodation as his only or main residence if it is occupied for the purpose of his full time course (section 259(2)(a)); and some religious communities are outside the HMO scheme if their principal occupation is prayer, contemplation, education or the relief of suffering (Schedule 14, paragraph 5).
Therefore, in certain circumstances the operation of the legislative scheme will depend on the personal characteristics of the occupants or their activities.
In the present case the Deputy President of the Upper Tribunal drew attention in his judgment to the fact that prior to the present legislation, under the 1985 Act, regard was had to the suitability of an HMO for occupation by a particular category of occupier.
Thus, in 1986 the Institution of Environmental Health Officers published guidance on amenity standards for HMOs which distinguished between different categories of HMOs.
In particular, Category A comprised houses occupied as individual rooms where there was some exclusive occupation and some sharing of amenities but each occupant lived otherwise independently of all others.
Category B comprised houses occupied on a shared basis which would normally be occupied by members of a defined social group, for example students or a group of young single adults.
In such houses the occupants each enjoyed exclusive use of a bedroom but would share other facilities including a communal living space.
Having distinguished between these categories in this way on the basis of the manner of occupation, the guidance then went on to set out different specifications for each category.
I note, moreover, that a revised version, the 1994 Amenity Standards, remained current until very recently and was available on the website of the successor body, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health.
A similar approach can be detected in certain guidance issued following the implementation of the current legislation.
The Deputy President of the Upper Tribunal in his judgment in the present case drew attention to the East Midlands DASH Guide produced by housing authorities in the East Midlands including Nottingham (see para 8, above) which recognises that different facilities may be required for different modes of occupation.
It provides that in HMOs where the occupants tend to live separately there should be a sink/wash hand basin within the living units.
Similarly, there was before the Court of Appeal in the present case a note prepared by Mr Robert Fookes, counsel for the respondents, setting out extracts from the current guidance issued by a selection of housing authorities responsible for accommodation likely to be used by students attending Oxford, Cambridge and Russell Group universities.
In half of these standards the housing authorities distinguish between students and other occupants.
As the Deputy President of the Upper Tribunal observed, it is obvious that nothing in this guidance can change the meaning of the present legislation.
Nevertheless, I agree with him that it provides a useful point of reference.
It may be thought that, as a matter of common sense, the manner of occupation of a room and the type of occupant may have a bearing on the suitability of a particular room for a particular use and that this is reflected in the guidance referred to above.
That guidance also supports the view that in practical terms the availability of communal living space may be capable of compensating for an undersized bedroom.
However, the critical question is whether the approach reflected in such guidance is consistent with the present legislation.
At the heart of the appeal on this ground lie two submissions by Mr Arden on behalf of Nottingham.
First, he submits that the conditions in issue here seek, contrary to the policy of the legislation, to introduce an exception to its operation for a category of persons or a defined set of circumstances.
It is clear that Part 2 of the 2004 Act is intended to apply to shared student houses.
One purpose behind the 2004 Act was to reverse the effect of Barnes v Sheffield City Council as a result of which many shared student houses fell outside the scope of the 1985 Act.
Express provision is made in section 259(2)(a) in respect of occupation for the purpose of undertaking a full time course of further or higher education and the effect of section 254(5) and Schedule 14, paragraph 4 is, by way of exception, to remove from this regulatory scheme certain buildings occupied by students.
Contrary to Nottinghams submission, however, I do not consider that the three conditions with which we are concerned have the effect of undermining this purpose.
These conditions do not remove shared student houses from the regulatory scheme.
On the contrary, as the decisions of the First tier Tribunal in the present cases demonstrate, the standard of accommodation available in a shared student house will be inspected and subjected to rigorous examination and the house will be licensed as suitable for a stipulated number of occupants only if it is considered to be so suitable (if necessary subject to conditions) by the housing authority for the area or, on appeal, by a specialist tribunal.
Secondly, Mr Arden submits that there is no doubt that the purpose in imposing the conditions in the present case was to allow occupation at a lower standard or by a greater number than would otherwise have been permitted in the circumstances of the HMOs in question.
I should observe at this point that it is clear that Nottingham in bringing this appeal and the Secretary of State in intervening have clearly been motivated by a wish to ensure that HMOs provide acceptable living conditions, to protect the vulnerable or potentially vulnerable groups that tend to occupy HMOs and to avoid an interpretation of the legislation as a result of which lower standards are to be considered appropriate for particular groups such as students.
That is commendable.
However, I consider that their concern is unfounded.
The imposition of conditions such as those imposed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal in the present case do not have that effect.
It is entirely appropriate, when considering the suitability of accommodation in an HMO for a particular purpose, to have regard to the mode of occupation.
If the house is to be occupied by a group living together cohesively, each having his or her own bedroom but sharing other facilities including a kitchen/diner and a living room, the availability of those additional facilities is a material consideration.
In these circumstances the mode of occupation means that the shared facilities will benefit all the occupants and, as a result, this may compensate for a bedroom which is slightly smaller than the recommended minimum.
By contrast, where occupants of an HMO each live independently of all others, sharing only bathroom, toilet and kitchen facilities, any communal living space made available will not benefit the occupants in the same way because of their different living arrangements.
It seems to me to be entirely appropriate, therefore, that in considering the suitability of accommodation in an HMO regard should be had to the proposed mode of occupation.
Furthermore, in appropriate cases effect may be given to such considerations by the imposition of conditions in the licence.
This is not inconsistent with the statutory scheme.
As the Deputy President of the Upper Tribunal pointed out in his judgment, certain types of accommodation may lend themselves to different styles of occupation and it would be surprising if the 2004 Act did not reflect that.
The various guidelines referred to earlier in this judgment refer in different ways to the need for flexibility in their application.
In that regard, account should be taken of the proposed mode of occupation where it is likely to influence the quality of the accommodation made available to the occupant.
It must be emphasised that this does not permit the application of lower standards than would otherwise be applicable.
On the contrary, it is simply that there will be certain circumstances in which, as a matter of common sense, it will be appropriate to have regard to the mode of occupation when applying the same objective standards which apply to all HMOs.
For these reasons, I consider that the power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67, Housing Act 2004, in order to make an HMO suitable for a particular number of households or persons, can be used so as to limit the class of persons for whom the HMO is suitable.
Finally, I should draw attention to the fact that there exist other mechanisms to maintain standards of accommodation in HMOs, in particular the imposition of mandatory conditions under Schedule 4 of the 2004 Act.
In this regard, I note that the Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (Mandatory Conditions of Licences) (England) Regulations 2018 (2018 No 616) (the 2018 Regulations), came into force on 1 October 2018 and introduced additional mandatory conditions in respect of floor area.
As a result a licence must now include a condition requiring the licence holder to ensure that the floor area of any room in the HMO used as sleeping accommodation by one person over ten years is not less than 6.51 square metres (paragraph 2, inserting Schedule 4, paragraph 1A(2)(a)).
Ground 2
Submissions of the parties
On behalf of Nottingham, Mr Arden submits that if there is a power to impose a condition based on a class of occupier, the conditions in the present case as directed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal are irrational, both in the conventional sense and in the sense that they are not effective to achieve their purpose, and incapable of enforcement.
While the conditions are designed to secure occupation only by students, this, he submits, is not necessarily the same as cohesive living.
The judgments below are said to have proceeded on the basis of an image of student life which is simply not true of all or necessarily most students, and this is an irrational basis for determining who may or may not occupy an HMO.
The conditions go no further than setting up the possibility of sharing.
In addition, it is said that the condition limiting occupation for a maximum period of ten calendar months over a period of one year is irrational.
Either the rooms are or are not suitable to be used as sleeping accommodation all the year round.
Nottingham objects that the condition that the attic rooms be occupied for only ten months over the course of a year could not practicably be monitored.
It also maintains that while it is possible to ensure that occupants are all in full time education, that requirement cannot in practice be enforced.
The Secretary of State has taken no position on this ground of appeal.
Mr Chamberlain submits that, while not all students live in the same way, the proxy employed by the condition is sufficiently precise.
Moreover, the First tier Tribunals which heard the initial appeals were well placed to judge whether cohesive living was the norm among students in the area where the properties were located.
With regard to enforceability, he takes issue with Nottingham.
Discussion
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the conditions imposed by the Tribunals were deficient in that they failed to require any part of the HMO to be available for communal living and did not require the bedrooms other than the front attic bedrooms to be let to students.
That deficiency is, however, cured by the further conditions introduced by the Court of Appeal.
The reasoning of the First tier Tribunals and the Upper Tribunal in this case makes clear that the intention was to restrict occupation to students because they were considered to be a category of occupants who were likely to live in a cohesive manner.
In the Upper Tribunal the Deputy President observed that by cohesive living the First tier Tribunal clearly had in mind the level of shared activity and social interaction to be expected in a shared house or Category B HMO, as described at greater length in the policy documents of other local authorities.
The first issue for consideration under this ground is therefore, as Mr Chamberlain put it, whether a condition limiting the occupation of each of the houses to occupation by persons engaged in full time education is a sufficiently precise proxy for occupation by persons living together cohesively.
All students are individuals and their respective activities and life styles will, no doubt, vary considerably.
Nevertheless, it does seem to me that the normal state of affairs generally to be expected when students share a student house is that there will be a high level of social activity and social interaction among them and that they will all make extensive use of the shared living facilities.
There can be no guarantee that any given student occupier will make full use of the shared facilities, but the availability of such facilities, emphasised by the Court of Appeal, coupled with the normal expectation of cohesive living in a student house makes it reasonable to adopt this proxy in this context.
It is also significant that the members of the First tier Tribunals in these cases, with their experience of student accommodation in Nottingham, considered this a reasonable approach.
While I agree with the Deputy President of the Upper Tribunal that an alternative condition, perhaps more closely reflecting its rationale, might require that all occupants be members of a group who intend to share the communal living space, the proxy adopted is sufficiently precise.
Moreover, the alternative might give rise to difficulties of enforcement.
The requirement that the attic rooms may only be occupied for ten months in each year was clearly intended to reinforce the requirement that occupation be by full time students.
If the latter requirement is lawful, the former is strictly unnecessary.
I consider that the requirement limiting occupation to ten months in each year is irrational.
If a room is suitable for occupation for sleeping for ten months in the year, it is suitable for such occupation for the entire year.
Moreover, full time students often require accommodation for the entire year.
In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider whether this requirement is enforceable.
I would vary the conditions imposed in respect of each property to delete the requirement that the attic rooms may only be occupied for ten months in each year.
Finally, it is said on behalf of Nottingham that while it is possible to ensure that occupants are all in full time education, it is not in practice possible to enforce the requirement.
Nottingham points to the 12 months assured shorthold tenancy agreements employed by the respondents.
Each requires the tenant to ensure that the propertys strict purpose as a set of lets to students of the University is not prejudiced and also contains a clause which entitles the landlord to re enter if the tenant ceases to be a student of the university.
However, Nottingham draws attention to the practical difficulties of evicting a tenant in these circumstances which, it is said, would make it practically impossible to enforce the conditions in the way envisaged by the legislation.
I note that if a landlord tries but fails to evict tenants who have ceased to be full time students, for example because the court considers it unreasonable to make the order, the landlord may well have a reasonable excuse for permitting the occupants to remain and a defence under section 72(5) of the 2004 Act to the offence of failing to comply with the licence condition.
However, the sanction of revocation of the licence will be available which, in itself, should be a sufficient sanction.
Conclusion
For these reasons, and subject to the deletion of the requirement of occupation for only ten months in each year, I consider that the conditions imposed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal, considered cumulatively, in respect of 44, Rothesay Avenue and 50, Bute Avenue, respectively, were entirely lawful.
Accordingly, I would vary the conditions to delete the requirement of occupation for only ten months in each year but would otherwise dismiss the appeal.
","Nottingham City Council, the appellant, is the licensing authority for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) in its area under Part 2 of the Housing Act 2004 (2004 Act).
This appeal concerns two HMOs, 44, Rothesay Avenue and 50, Bute Avenue which are owned by the second respondent, Trevor Parr Associates Ltd. The first respondent, Dominic Parr, is the managing director of the second respondent and the manager of the two HMOs.
The 2004 Act requires HMOs to be licensed by the local housing authority.
The local housing authority can grant the application under section 64 of the 2004 Act if it is satisfied that, among other requirements, the house is reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons [specified in the application or decided by the authority] or that it can be made so suitable by the imposition of conditions under section 67 [of the 2004 Act].
The appellant issued guidance on the operation of the licensing system, which provides that the minimum space provision in the case of bedrooms in single occupation in HMOs is eight square metres, although a degree of flexibility is sometimes possible if other features are present. 44, Rothesay Avenue and 50, Bute Avenue are both used for letting to students and each has an attic bedroom with an area of useable living space below eight square metres.
In each case, the appellant granted an HMO licence which imposed a condition prohibiting the use of the attic bedroom for sleeping.
The respondents appealed to the First tier Tribunal against the imposition of the conditions.
The First tier Tribunal at separate hearings deleted the conditions imposed by the appellant.
In the case of 44, Rothesay Avenue it substituted a condition that the attic bedroom may only be used for sleeping accommodation by a full time student who resides in the bedroom for a maximum of ten months in each year.
The appellant appealed both decisions to the Upper Tribunal, which dismissed the appeals and also directed that the substituted condition be included in the HMO licence for 50, Bute Avenue.
The appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the decision of the Upper Tribunal and included further conditions in both HMO licences that the communal space be kept available for communal living only and that no bedrooms be let to persons other than full time students.
The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court contending that the power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67 of the 2004 Act cannot be used to limit the class of persons for whom the HMO is suitable, and that the conditions imposed by the First tier Tribunal, Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal are irrational and unenforceable.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, subject to varying the conditions to delete the requirement of occupation for a maximum of ten months in each year.
Lord Lloyd Jones gives the sole judgment with which the other Justices agree.
Section 64(3)(a) of the 2004 Act indicates that the purpose of the imposition of conditions is to make a house reasonably suitable for occupation by not more than the maximum number of households or persons specified in the application or decided by the housing authority.
Section 67(1)(a) provides that a licence may include such conditions as the local housing authority considers appropriate for regulating all or any of the management, use and occupation of the house concerned, and section 67(2) sets out a non exhaustive list of permitted conditions including conditions imposing restrictions or prohibitions on the use or occupation of particular parts of the house by persons occupying it [18].
These words in their natural meaning are sufficiently wide to include the conditions imposed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal [18].
Such a reading is also consistent with the object and purpose of the 2004 Act.
Elsewhere in Part 2 of the 2004 Act, the manner of occupation and characteristics of occupants are considered relevant in contexts connected with HMOs and housing standards generally [20].
The guidance in respect of the 2004 Act also supports the view that the manner of occupation of a room and the type of occupant may have a bearing on the suitability of a particular room for a particular use [23].
The Court does not consider that the conditions in issue introduce an exception for a category of persons or a defined set of circumstances [24].
Furthermore, they do not permit occupation at a lower standard [25].
It is therefore appropriate to have regard to the proposed mode of occupation in considering the suitability of accommodation in an HMO [26].
In particular, account should be taken of the proposed mode of occupation where it is likely to influence the quality of the accommodation made available to the occupant.
However, this does not permit the application of lower standards than would otherwise be applicable [26].
Thus, the power to impose conditions under sections 64 and 67 of the 2004 Act can be used to limit the class of persons for whom the HMO is suitable [27].
The Court agrees with the Court of Appeal that the conditions imposed by the Tribunals were deficient in that they failed to require any part of the HMO to be available for communal living and did not require the bedrooms other than the attic bedrooms to be let to students.
That deficiency was, however, cured by the further conditions introduced by the Court of Appeal [33].
The condition limiting the occupation to persons engaged in full time education is rational [35] and enforceable [37].
The Court considers, however, that the requirement limiting occupation to ten months in each year is irrational [36].
Therefore, subject to the deletion of the requirement of occupation for a maximum of ten months in each year, the conditions imposed by the Tribunals and the Court of Appeal in each case, considered cumulatively, were entirely lawful.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court varies the conditions to delete the requirement of occupation for a maximum of ten months in each year but otherwise dismisses the appeal [38].
"
uksc-2010-0231,"This appeal is about the application of the annual leave provisions of the Working Time Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/1833) (the WTR) to offshore workers in the oil and gas industry.
Employers differ in the way they organise their employees working time.
The familiar pattern of working from 9am to 5pm five days each week throughout the 52 weeks of the year, with a few weeks taken from that commitment for annual holidays, is by no means uniform.
For some, the nature of the job requires them to work for longer hours during each working day and to be given more days off during the working week to compensate.
For others such as teachers and others who work in the education sector, the working pattern has to take account of the fact that the organisation for which they work is open for some periods of the year and is closed for others.
The appellants in this case work offshore, so their working pattern is divided into time spent working offshore and time spent onshore when, by and large, they are not working.
The only unifying factors in what is, after all, an infinite variety are that the way in which a workers time is organised is a function of the nature of the job itself, and that in the interests of health and safety workers must be given some time off to rest.
The WTR contain the provisions that currently provide for rest periods in domestic law.
They were designed to implement Council Directive 93/104/EC.
The 1993 Directive was repealed by Council Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (the WTD).
It consolidated the 1993 Directive and a subsequent amending Directive and took effect as from 2 August 2004.
Among the aspects of the organisation of working time that are the subject of rules in the WTD are minimum rest periods.
They are set out in chapter 2.
As it is concerned with laying down what are described as minimum requirements, the provisions which it contains adopt for the most part a one size fits all approach.
There is scope for derogation in particular cases, and there are special rules for mobile workers, those engaged in offshore work and workers on board seagoing fishing vessels.
But there is no attempt, either in the WTD or the WTR, to identify particular patterns of working and legislate for them individually.
It is for the judiciary, in the event of a dispute, to work out how its requirements
are to be applied in particular cases
The problem in this case is how the statutory right to paid annual leave under the WTR is to be applied to offshore workers in the oil and gas industry.
Typically they work a two weeks offshore and two weeks onshore (known as field break) shift pattern.
Some work three weeks offshore and three weeks onshore, and some work two weeks offshore and three weeks onshore.
But nothing turns on these differences.
The central issue is whether the period spent onshore should count towards the workers entitlement under regulation 13 of the WTR to what, when the appellants made their claims, was to four weeks paid annual leave.
That entitlement has now been increased by an amendment to the WTR to 5.6 weeks, by adding 1.6 weeks to take account of Bank Holidays: regulation 13A, inserted by regulation 2(1)(2) of the Working Time (Amendment) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/2079).
But nothing turns on that point either in this case.
The appellants say that annual leave, properly construed, means release from what would otherwise have been an obligation to work, and that the employers cannot discharge their obligation to provide them with annual leave by insisting that they take this during periods of field break.
Their periods of field break, they say, is their time.
It is not their employers time, and they insist that it is the employers time out of which the annual leave should be taken.
The respondents say that the time spent onshore is in itself a rest period, as it is not working time.
And they point out that it is substantially more than the minimum of four weeks annual leave to which the appellants are entitled under the WTR.
Their case is that the requirements of the WTR are more than satisfied already, and there is no need for the appellants to take annual leave out of the periods spent offshore.
As the appellants point out, the issue that this dispute raises is important not just for the parties themselves.
It has significant implications for other parts of the labour market.
We cannot resolve all the problems that may possibly arise in this case.
But the answer to the dispute has to take account of the fact that the WTD, and the WTR which give effect to it, have been designed to apply to the labour market generally.
Annual leave the statutory entitlement
It will be necessary to examine the WTD and the WTR in more detail later.
For the time being it is sufficient to note that article 7 of the WTD provides that member states shall take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker is entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks.
This is to be in accordance with conditions laid down by national legislation and/or practice.
Regulation 13(1) of the WTR gives effect to this requirement.
It provides that a worker is entitled to four weeks annual leave in each leave year.
Regulation 15 contains provisions about how the days when this is to be taken are to be worked out between the worker and the employer, if this has not already been agreed, by a system of notices and counter notices.
The facts
The appellants cases are seven sample cases which have been selected from a much larger number of similar complaints that were lodged with the employment tribunal.
They were all employed to work in various capacities on offshore installations located in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf.
There were differences in the way their contracts were expressed as they were working for different employers, but it was agreed that nothing turns on these details.
With the exception of Mr Craig, the appellants were contracted to work to a pattern of two weeks offshore with a period of field break for two weeks onshore.
Mr Craig was contracted to work three weeks offshore followed by three weeks onshore.
Whilst offshore the appellants generally worked, and still work, a 12 hour shift each day during which rest breaks are taken.
This was followed by 12 hours off duty living offshore on the installation.
They did not have any days off while they were offshore.
Part of the time during which the appellants were on field break was occupied in travelling to and from the installation and Aberdeen airport by helicopter, and to and from home once they were onshore.
During the periods of field break the appellants attended occasional events that could only be undertaken onshore, such as training courses, appraisals, grievance and disciplinary hearings, medical assessments and offshore survival courses.
But it is agreed that these occasional activities are of no significance for present purposes.
For the most part the appellants were free from work related obligations during the entire period of their field breaks.
They could spend their time as they chose.
The appellants issued proceedings in the employment tribunal at Aberdeen in which they contended that the relevant provisions of the WTR required the respondents to permit them to take four weeks paid annual leave from periods when they would otherwise be required to work on the offshore installation.
The respondents maintained that the paid annual leave entitlement was discharged by two weeks onshore within the shift pattern.
In a long and careful judgment, which covered various other issues with which we are not concerned and was sent to the parties on 21 February 2008, the employment tribunal held that leave in regulation 13 of the WTR involved a release from what would otherwise have been an obligation to work, or at least to be available for work or otherwise in some way on call: para 300.
So the field breaks were not to be regarded as annual leave for the purposes of the regulation, although they might provide periods of compensatory rest for the purposes of regulation 24 to the extent required: para 310 (xxviii).
In a review judgment dated 1 December 2008 the tribunal confirmed that, in its view, a worker is entitled to exercise his or her right to paid annual leave under regulation 13 at such times as he or she would otherwise be obliged to work or be available to work.
In the case of a worker whose pattern of work was to work for two weeks followed by two weeks break from work, the entitlement to paid annual leave amounted to two weeks to be taken from time when he or she would otherwise be working.
It had already explained in para 308 of its judgment the calculation on which this conclusion was based and which is not now in dispute.
The number of days worked during each period of 28 days was 14 days, which amounted to an average of three and a half days a week.
This produced an annual leave entitlement of 14 days.
The number of hours worked each day made no difference.
The tribunals finding that the respondents had refused to permit the appellants to exercise their right to paid annual leave because this could not be taken out of field break was set aside by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (Lady Smith, Mr M Sibbald and Mr R Thomson, Mr Thomson dissenting) in a judgment issued on 6 March 2009: [2009] IRLR 519.
Lady Smith said in para 130 of the judgment that the time conceded to be available during field breaks, after allowing for compensatory rest to take account of the fact that the appellants worked offshore without a weekly rest period, was more than sufficient to cover the entitlement to annual leave.
It was time when they were free of all and any work obligations and not subject to the possibility of being called on to work.
It was to be regarded as a rest period.
It did not matter that, because of the working patterns in the industry, the appellants would not otherwise be working during these periods.
The appellants appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session.
Their case was heard by an Extra Division (Lord Eassie, Lady Paton and Lord Emslie), which refused the appeal and remitted various outstanding issues to the Employment Appeal Tribunal to proceed accords: 2011 SC 175.
The opinion of the court was delivered by Lord Eassie.
He said that the court found force in the analysis advanced by the respondents that the structure of chapter 2 of the WTD involved different cycles of working time, and that what article 7 of the WTD required was that there be provided to the worker within the year at least four remunerated weeks of the yearly cycle in which he was free from working commitments: paras 33 34.
There was nothing in the WTD to suggest that employers might not arrange matters so that annual leave was taken during the school holidays or such similar industrial equivalent: para 36.
In para 37 he acknowledged that the appellants were required to work for about 26 weeks every year.
But that requirement did not constitute an infringement of the cap, or limit, on the number of working weeks in the year set by article 7 as 48 weeks.
That the 26 weeks onshore were termed as field break was not a matter upon which anything turned.
He summarised the courts decision in para 51: on the core question of whether the annual provision by the employers of 26 weeks of field break fails to satisfy the entitlement of the employees under regulation 13 of the WTR, the answer which we give is in the negative.
For all the reasons which we have given we consider that the working pattern of field break applicable in these appeals satisfies the requirements of the WTR, interpreted in the light of the WTD.
Relevant provisions of the WTD
The Treaty base for the WTD is identified in recital 2 of the preamble.
It refers to article 137 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which provides that the Community is to support and complement the activities of the member states with a view to improving the working environment to protect workers health and safety.
As Lady Smith pointed out in the EATs judgment [2009] IRLR 519, para 9, the source for the WTD can be traced back to the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, adopted at Strasbourg on 9 December 1989.
Adopting words used in paras 8 and 19 of the Charter, recitals 4 and 5 of the preamble to the WTD then state: 4.
The improvement of workers safety, hygiene and health at work is an objective which should not be subordinated to purely economic considerations. 5.
All workers should have adequate rest periods.
The concept of rest must be expressed in units of time, ie in days, hours and/or fractions thereof.
Community workers must be granted minimum daily, weekly and annual periods of rest and adequate breaks.
It is also necessary in this context to place a maximum limit on weekly working hours.
The purpose and scope of the Directive are identified in article 1, which states that it lays down minimum safety and health requirements for the organisation of working time and that it applies to minimum periods of daily rest, weekly rest and annual leave, to breaks and maximum weekly working time.
Article 2 provides the following definitions of the expressions working time and rest period: 1. working time means any period during which the worker is working, at the employers disposal and carrying out his activity or duties, in accordance with national laws and/or practice; 2. rest period means any period which is not working time.
There then follows Chapter 2, which is headed minimum rest periods other aspects of the organisation of working time.
The way working time is to be organised is then set out in articles 3 to 7.
Article 3, which is headed Daily rest, states that the member states shall take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker is entitled to a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours per 24 hour period.
Article 4, which is headed Breaks, states that member states shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, where the working day is longer than six hours, every worker is entitled to a rest break, the details of which shall be laid down in collective agreements or agreements between the two sides of industry or, failing that, by national legislation.
Article 5, which is headed Weekly rest period, states that member states shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, per each seven day period, every worker is entitled to a minimum uninterrupted period of 24 hours plus the 11 hours daily rest referred to in article 3.
Article 6, which is headed Maximum weekly working time, states that member states shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, in keeping with the need to protect the safety and health of workers, the average working time of each seven day period, including overtime, does not exceed 48 hours.
Pausing there, one can see that the time that is available within the working week is to be organised in such a way as to ensure (i) that every worker whose working day is longer than six hours is entitled during the day to a rest break, (ii) that every worker is entitled to a minimum period which is not working time of 11 consecutive hours of daily rest during each 24 hour period and (iii) that every worker is entitled during each seven day period to a minimum uninterrupted rest period of 24 hours as well as 11 consecutive hours of daily rest in each 24 hour period.
Each period must therefore be measured separately from each other.
They cannot intrude upon each other or overlap.
Article 17 provides in paragraph 3(a) that derogations may be made from, among others, articles 3, 4 and 5 in the case of activities where the workers place of work and his place of residence are distant from one another, including offshore work, or where the workers different places of work are distant from one another.
In that event, paragraph 2 of article 17 requires that the workers concerned are afforded equivalent periods of compensatory rest or, if in exceptional cases for objective reasons this is not possible, that they are afforded appropriate protection.
It was agreed that in the appellants' case the first two days of each period of their field break is accounted for as compensatory rest, to make up for the fact that they work a 12 hour shift each day during their two weeks offshore.
Article 7 is headed Annual leave.
As article 17 makes clear, it cannot be derogated from.
It is in these terms: 1.
Member states shall take the measures necessary to ensure that every worker is entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks in accordance with the conditions for entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by national legislation and/or practice. 2.
The minimum period of paid annual leave may not be replaced by an allowance in lieu, except where the employment relationship is terminated.
The words consecutive and uninterrupted which qualify the periods of daily rest in article 3 and weekly rest in article 5 do not appear here.
So article 7 does not require that the weeks of annual leave must be taken consecutively or that those weeks cannot be interrupted.
The units of time referred to in recital 5 of the preamble (days, hours and/or fractions thereof) do not include weeks.
But the text of articles 5 and 6 shows that the word weekly, which appears in the heading to those articles, refers to a seven day period.
Article 21 of the WTD, which deals with workers on board seagoing fishing vessels, also refers to a seven day period, as does article 22.
In this context the reference in article 7 to four weeks, rather than to 28 days, would seem prima facie to mean four uninterrupted seven day periods, but the conditions of the granting of such leave are left to national legislation and/or practice.
As a period of leave is not a period which is working time, as defined in article 2, it must be taken to be what that article defines as a rest period.
It is an annual period of rest: see recital 5.
There is one other point.
Mr Linden QC for the appellants said that the right to paid annual leave had a qualitative dimension.
It was not just a matter of calculating, as a matter of arithmetic, how much time the worker was to have in a given year.
The word leave was not defined in the WTD, but it was more than just rest.
Reducing the matter to a simple arithmetical exercise would defeat the safety and health purpose of the annual leave provision and ignore the point that the compulsory rest periods are the minimum periods that are required.
His submission, as I understood it, was that the field breaks did not have the quality that would enable any periods within them to be enjoyed as periods of annual leave.
He used it to support his basic point that, as these periods onshore were not part of the appellants working time, they could not count towards their annual leave entitlement.
I do not think that a qualitative requirement, as an additional test of whether a given period can be accounted as rest within the cycles of time that are identified, is to be found in the wording of the WTD.
It is true that the safety and health of workers lies at the heart of the rules that it lays down.
But there is no indication anywhere that it was concerned about the quality of the minimum periods of rest, other than to make it clear in the definition of rest period that it means a period which is not working time.
The periods that it has identified must be taken in themselves to meet the objects stated in the preamble.
The plain indication of its wording is that the exercise that must be carried out is indeed simply one of counting up the relevant hours, days or seven day periods and ensuring that the worker is not required to work during those periods.
For example, conditions offshore vary from installation to installation and from time to time.
The quality of the rest that can be enjoyed will vary.
It may be disturbed by the noise and vibration that are part and parcel of offshore operations.
But so long as the worker is given not less than 11 consecutive hours each day which is not working time, the requirements of article 3 will have been satisfied.
Relevant provisions of the WTR
The purpose of the WTR was to implement the provisions of the WTD.
Its provisions must be interpreted, so far as possible, in conformity with the wording and purposes of the Directive: Litster v Forth Dry Dock and Engineering Co Ltd 1989 SC (HL) 96, 101, 105; [1990] 1 AC 546, 554, 559 per Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton; Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacin SA (Case C 106/89) [1990] ECR I 4135, para 9.
So they are of secondary importance in this case.
They are nevertheless relevant, as they set out the domestic rules that must be complied with in conformity with the obligations set out in the WTD.
Regulation 2(1) sets out the meaning that is to be given to various words and phrases, among which are the following: rest period, in relation to a worker, means a period which is not working time, other than a rest break or leave to which the worker is entitled under these Regulations. working time, in relation to a worker, means (a) any period during which he is working, at his employers disposal and carrying out his activity or duties, (b) any period during which he is receiving relevant training, and (c) any additional period which is to be treated as working time for the purpose of these Regulations under a relevant agreement.
Regulation 2(2) provides that in the absence of a definition in the Regulations, words and expressions used in particular provisions which are also used in corresponding provisions of the WTD have the same meaning as they have in those corresponding provisions.
The word leave is not defined in the WTR, but it is not defined in the WTD either.
It is left to take its meaning from the context.
Like the expression rest break, it is a period which is not working time.
This accords with the fact that a period which is not working time is defined by article 2 of the WTD as a rest period: see para 14, above.
The rules about daily rest, weekly rest periods and rest breaks are set out in regulations 10, 11 and 12 in terms which, without reproducing exactly the language of the WTD, reflect its requirements.
They also contain some additions.
For example, regulation 11, which deals with the weekly rest period, allows the employer to provide the worker with either two uninterrupted rest periods each of not less than 24 hours within each 14 day period or one uninterrupted rest period of not less than 48 hours in each such 14 day period in place of the entitlement to an uninterrupted rest period of 24 hours in each seven day period during which he works for the employer.
Regulation 13, as amended, which sets out the entitlement to annual leave, contains the following provisions: (1) Subject to paragraph (5) [which is not relevant for present purposes], a worker is entitled to four weeks annual leave in each leave year. (9) Leave to which a worker is entitled under this regulation may be taken in instalments, but (a) it may only be taken in the leave year in respect of which it is due, and (b) it may not be replaced by a payment in lieu except where the workers employment is terminated.
Regulation 15 makes provision for the dates on which annual leave may be taken under regulation 13.
This is where the conditions for the granting of such leave, referred to in article 7 of the WTD, are to be found.
The basic rules are set out in paragraph (1).
They are that a worker may take leave to which he is entitled on such days as he may elect by giving notice to his employer in accordance with paragraph (3), but that this is subject to any requirement imposed on him by his employer under paragraph (2).
Paragraph (2) provides: A workers employer may require the worker (a) to take leave to which the worker is entitled ; or (b) not to take such leave, on particular days, by giving notice to the worker in accordance with paragraph (3).
Paragraph (3) states that a notice under paragraph (1) or (2) may relate to all or any part of the leave to which a worker is entitled in any leave year, must specify the days on which leave is or is not to be taken and, where the leave on a particular day is to be in respect of only a part of a day, its duration.
It contains provisions about the date before which notice is to be given to the employer or the worker, as the case may be.
Regulation 21 takes advantage of the provisions about derogation in article 17 of the WTD.
It provides that regulations 10, 11 and 12 do not apply in relation to a worker, among others, whose activities are such that his place of work and place of residence are distant from one another.
Regulation 24 provides that where the application of any provision of the Regulations is excluded by regulation 21 and a worker is accordingly required by his employer to work during a period which would otherwise be a rest period or rest break, his employer shall wherever possible allow him to take an equivalent period of compensatory rest.
This accords with what is to be found in article 17 of the WTD: see para 17, above.
The appellants case
Mr Lindens case was based on the proposition that leave could not be taken out of the periods when the appellants were on field break because they were not required by their contracts to work during those periods.
These weeks were, as it was put, theirs already.
It was inherent in the concept of leave that the worker was being released from the obligation to work.
As they were not required to work during their field breaks, there were no periods within them for which they required to be given leave in order to remain onshore.
This gave meaning to the concept of leave, and it was how the bargain between the parties should be interpreted.
It was more than just rest.
It was the workers right to say to his employer that, although his employer required him to work during a given period, he wanted to take his annual leave and to be released from the obligation to work during that period so that he could do so.
He submitted that the importance of the purpose for which the right to leave was given was illustrated by Merino Gomez v Continental Industrias del Caucho SA (Case C 342/01) [2005] ICR 1040.
The problem that arose in that case was a conflict between the Community law right to maternity leave on the one hand and the statutory right to annual leave under the Spanish implementation of article 7 of the WTD on the other.
The ECJ held that the entitlement to paid annual leave was not to be regarded as having been met where the worker had been absent on maternity leave, as the purposes of these two entitlements was different.
In paras 29, 30 and 32 the court said (omitting its references to previous case law): 29.
The entitlement of every worker to paid annual leave must be regarded as a particularly important principle of Community social law from which there can be no derogations and whose implementation by the competent national authorities must be confined within the limits expressly laid down by Directive 93/104 [the then current working time Directive].
It is significant in that connection that that Directive also embodies the rule that a worker must normally be entitled to actual rest, with a view to ensuring effective protection of his health and safety, since it is only where the employment relationship is terminated that article 7(2) permits an allowance to be paid in lieu of paid annual leave. 32.
The purpose of the entitlement to annual leave is different from that of the entitlement to maternity leave.
Maternity leave is intended, first, to protect a womans biological condition during and after pregnancy and, secondly, to protect the special relationship between a woman and her child over the period which follows pregnancy and childbirth. 30.
Mr Linden referred also to Stringer v Revenue and Customs Comrs (Joined Cases C 520/06 and C 350/06) [2009] ICR 932, in which the issue was whether workers continued to accrue an entitlement to paid annual leave whilst absent on long term sickness and were entitled to take it during periods of absence on sick leave.
He submitted that the judgment identified the qualitative nature of paid annual leave, which was different from sick leave.
After recalling what had been said about annual leave in Gomez, paras 29 and 30, the Grand Chamber said this in para 25 of its judgment: It is common ground that the purpose of the entitlement to paid annual leave is to enable the worker to rest and to enjoy a period of relaxation and leisure.
The purpose of the entitlement to sick leave is different.
It is given to the worker so that he can recover from being ill.
But it did not add anything to its previous jurisprudence on this matter.
There was no indication here or in Gomez that the quality of any periods of time that were set aside for rest affected the question whether, in terms of their duration or the time that was selected, they were sufficient for the purposes of the WTD.
In Pereda v Madrid Movilidad SA (Case C 277/08) [2009] ECR 1 8405, recalling what had been said about this in Gomez and Stringer, the ECJ again said that the purpose of the entitlement to annual leave was to enable the worker to rest and enjoy a period of relaxation and leisure: see paras 18 21.
Mr Linden drew attention to the fact that the claimant in that case was under a 52 week contract that required him to work all the year round.
He said that this was to be contrasted with the facts of this case, where the contract to work was what he described as a 26 week contract and there was no obligation to work for the other 26 weeks.
But there was no suggestion in the Pereda case that the scheduled leave period did not count towards the statutory minimum annual leave entitlement because it was a period when the workers would not otherwise be working.
It is to be noted too that the court said in para 22 that the scheduling of leave according to the rules and procedures of national law could take account of the various interests involved, including the overriding reasons relating to the interests of the undertaking.
In the appellants case, it is the overriding interests of the employers that has led to the working pattern being organised in a way that requires their workers to work throughout the 14 days when they are offshore and to have their periods of rest and relaxation, other than breaks and the daily rest, during their field break onshore.
Reference was also made to Sumsion v BBC (Scotland) [2007] IRLR 678, which the employment tribunal attempted to distinguish from the present case.
The BBC sought to discharge its obligation to Mr Sumsion by requiring him to take every Saturday off as a leave day to make up his annual leave under regulation 13 of the WTR.
His contract referred to the fact that his services would be required for up to six turns of duty per week, and that he was to be entitled to six days leave to be taken on any sixth non scheduled days in a week.
The employment tribunal held in Sumsion that the BBC was not in breach of the WTR by requiring him to take his leave on Saturdays, and its decision was upheld by the EAT.
In this case the employment tribunal said that the period of leave which Mr Sumsion was given was one when there was an obligation to work, whereas in the case of the field break out of which the respondents said leave should be taken there was no such obligation and never had been: para 289.
I would not draw that distinction.
It seems to me that the arrangements in both cases were essentially the same.
It was known from the outset that the periods during which the employer was insisting leave should be taken were periods when the workers would not be required to work.
That said, the facts of that case were, as Lord Eassie pointed out in para 50 of his opinion, somewhat special.
It was a short term contract under which it could be said, as the EAT in that case concluded, that the employee had elected for his Saturdays to be taken as leave days under regulation 15 with the result that it was open to his employers to request him to do so.
The case was also decided in the light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Ainsworth [2005] EWCA Civ 441, [2005] ICR 1149 before that decision was in effect set aside by the ECJs ruling in that case: see Stringer v Revenue and Customs Comrs [2009] ICR 932.
And the device of requiring the worker to take his leave on Saturdays (the Saturday problem) does not arise in the case of the offshore workers.
For all these reasons I do not think that the EATs decision in Sumsion offers any assistance to the solution of the problem that is before us in this case.
It is worth noting however that in para 26 of its judgment in that case the EAT recognised that there might be cases in which, if the whole facts and circumstances were examined, it could be demonstrated that the employer, in nominating Saturday as a leave day, was not affording any real leave at all.
Discussion
I do not think that is right to describe the contract in this case, as Mr Linden sought to do, as a 26 week contract.
The fact is that the appellants were under contract with their employers for the whole of each year.
Their working pattern was organised in such a way that working time was limited to the 26 weeks when they were offshore.
But their contractual relationship with their employers continued irrespective of where they were at any given time.
They had continuity of employment throughout the year.
The fact that their pattern of working was a repeating shift pattern was a product of that contractual relationship.
The critical question is how that repeating shift pattern falls to be viewed for the purposes of the WTD.
How is it to be determined whether the rules that it lays down for what recital 5 of the preamble refers to as daily, weekly and annual periods of rest are satisfied?
As I have already explained (see para 21, above), I do not think that the quality of the periods that are set aside during each cycle determines whether the minimum requirements have been satisfied.
I accept that the purpose of the entitlement to annual leave is to enable the worker to rest and enjoy a period of relaxation and leisure, as the ECJ has repeatedly made clear.
But the WTD has met that purpose by laying down the minimum periods of rest that must be given in each cycle.
As the ECJ said in Gomez [2005] ICR 1040, para 30, the fact that rest means actual rest is demonstrated by the rule that it is only where the employment relationship is terminated that article 7(2) permits an allowance to be paid in lieu of paid annual leave.
But the ECJ has not said that a pre ordained rest period, when the worker is free from all obligations to the employer, can never constitute annual leave within the meaning of that article.
I would hold therefore that rest period simply means any period which is not working time: see article 2.
Any period includes every such period irrespective of where the worker is at that time and what he is doing, so long as it is a period when he is not working.
I think it is plain that any period when the appellants are on field break onshore will fall into that category.
The employment tribunal recognised in para 286 of its judgment that there was an element of circularity in the appellants argument: ie, is it that a particular period cannot be said to be leave because it is a period when there is no obligation to work, or is it that there is only no obligation to work because the period in question has already been designated as leave? It referred to the case of teachers in non term time and tradesmen in the trades fortnight as examples of the latter where the period when annual leave could be taken had already been designated.
But it did not try to resolve this apparent anomaly, as it did not see these cases as giving rise in practice to any difficulty.
The solution which it favoured, contrary to what happened in practice in those cases, seemed to it to be founded on the common sense proposition that the workers entitlement to each of the measures provided for by the WTR required to be real, in the sense that they genuinely provided a break from what would otherwise be an obligation to work or to be available to work.
But the facts of this case do not support the idea that the field break is not a genuine break or otherwise unreal.
Nor has there been any suggestion that the pattern of working has had, or is liable to have, an adverse effect on the appellants health or safety.
For these reasons I would hold that the respondents are entitled to insist that the appellants must take their paid annual leave during periods when they are onshore on field break.
In my opinion this is permitted by regulation 13 of the WTR, read in conformity with article 7 of the WTD.
Other problem cases
Attention was drawn in the course of the argument to two other problem cases which it was said might give rise to difficulty.
The first was the case of teachers, already mentioned by the employment tribunal, who are required to take their annual leave during non term time.
Various other cases fall into this category, such as professional footballers, staff who work in the devolved legislatures such as the Scottish Parliament and in the Parliament at Westminster and people who work full time during the season in the tourist industry.
They are people who are left, for the most part, with no option but to take their paid annual leave during periods when they are not required to work.
But the problem in their case disappears if, as I would hold, there is no objection to their being required to take their annual leave during those periods.
The other problem was referred to as the Saturday problem, which is illustrated by the case of Sumsion.
It was said to arise from the ability of employers under regulation 15 of the WTR to designate days within the week when the worker would not otherwise be working as annual leave.
Carried to its extreme this could result in workers who worked a five day week, Sundays being treated as the weekly rest period, being required to take their annual leave each Saturday.
This would exhaust the possibility of there ever being whole weeks in the year when annual leave could be taken.
A literal reading of the employers rights under regulation 15(2) suggests that this course might be open to him.
It would obviously be an abuse of the system as the EAT indicated in Sumsion v BBC (Scotland) [2007] IRLR 678, para 26.
But the suggestion was that it was an abuse which could not be prevented.
This raises a different problem from that which arises in the case of the offshore workers.
The question is not whether a worker can be required to take annual leave during a period when he would not otherwise have been working but whether the worker can be forced to take his entitlement to annual leave in periods which are shorter than one week.
But it is not a problem that has to be answered in this case.
There seems to me to be much to be said for the view that, when article 7 of the WTD is read together with the purposes identified in the preamble and in the light of what the ECJ said in Gomez [2005] ICR 1040, para 30, the entitlement is to periods of annual leave measured in weeks, not days.
The worker can opt to take all or part of it in days, if he chooses to do so.
But the employer cannot force him to do so.
But I do not need to reach a concluded view on this point, and I have not done so.
Reference
Mr Linden submitted that the meaning that was to be given to the expression annual leave in article 7 of the WTD was not so obvious as to leave no room for reasonable doubt and that, if the court was not persuaded that the appeal should be allowed, the issue should be referred to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling under article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Various other issues were listed in his written case as requiring a reference.
I am not persuaded that a reference is necessary in this case on any of the questions that have been listed.
We must be mindful of our responsibility as a court against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law.
But the ruling in Srl CILFIT v Ministry of Health (Case 283/81) [1982] ECR 3415 permits us to decline to make a reference if a decision on the point is not necessary to enable the court to give judgment or the answer to the question is acte clair.
I do not think that the meaning to be given to article 7, for the purposes of this judgment, is open to any reasonable doubt.
The wording and structure of the WTD plainly favours the respondents argument, and I can find nothing in any of the judgments of the ECJ to which we were referred that casts doubt on the meaning which I think should be given to it.
I would refuse the request for a reference.
Conclusion
I would dismiss the appeal.
I would affirm the interlocutor of the Extra Division of the Court of Session.
","The Appellants are all employed to work in various capacities on offshore oil and gas installations.
The Respondents are their employers.
With the exception of one, all were contracted to work to a pattern of two weeks offshore followed by two weeks onshore (called a field break).
Whilst offshore the Appellants generally worked a 12 hour shift each day during which rest breaks were taken.
This was followed by 12 hours off duty living offshore on the installation.
They did not have any days off while they were offshore.
For the most part the Appellants were free from work related obligations during the entire period of their field breaks.
The Working Time Regulations 1998 (the WTR) set out in domestic law the provisions of the Working Time Directive 2003 (the WTD), which lays down minimum health and safety requirements for the organisation of working time, with minimum rest periods consisting of daily rest, weekly rest and annual leave (Articles 3 to 7 WTD).
Article 7 of the WTD and Regulation 13 of the WTR provide that the worker is entitled to paid annual leave of at least four weeks (at the time the Appellants made their claims).
Regulation 15 of the WTR provides that a worker may take leave to which he is entitled on such days as he chooses by giving notice to his employer, but that the employer may require him to take leave on particular days.
The issue in this case is whether the period spent onshore should count towards the workers entitlement to four weeks paid annual leave.
The Appellants issued proceedings contending that annual leave, properly construed, means release from what would otherwise have been an obligation to work, and therefore the WTR required the Respondents to permit them to take annual leave from periods when they would otherwise be required to work on the offshore installation.
The Respondents maintained that the time onshore is itself a rest period, as it is not working time, so the paid annual leave entitlement was discharged by two weeks onshore within the shift pattern.
The Employment Tribunal held that leave in Regulation 13 of the WTR involved a release from what would otherwise have been an obligation to work.
That decision was set aside by the Employment Appeal Tribunal, which held that the time available during field breaks, after allowing for compensatory rest to take account of the fact that the Appellants worked offshore without a weekly rest period, was more than sufficient to cover the entitlement to annual leave.
The Inner House of the Court of Session refused the Appellants appeal, holding that what the WTD required was that there be provided to the worker within the year at least four remunerated weeks in which he was free from working commitments.
There was nothing in the WTD to suggest that employers might not arrange matters so that annual leave was taken during the school holidays or such similar industrial equivalent.
The Supreme Court unanimously refuses the request for a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union, dismisses the appeal, and affirms the interlocutor of the Extra Division of the Court of Session.
The judgment is given by Lord Hope.
Under the WTD, every worker must be entitled to a rest break, a daily rest, and a weekly rest period.
Each period must be measured separately from each other.
They cannot intrude upon each other or overlap [16].
Where necessary because of special working patterns, workers must be afforded equivalent periods of compensatory rest.
In the Appellants case, it was agreed that the first two days of each period of their field break is accounted for as compensatory rest, to make up for the fact that they work a 12 hour shift every day during their two weeks offshore [17].
With regard to the annual leave entitlement, Article 7 of the WTD does not require that those four weeks must be taken consecutively or that those weeks cannot be interrupted [18].
But as a period of leave is not a period which is defined in Article 2 as working time, it must be taken to be what that article defines as a rest period.
It is an annual period of rest [19].
The WTD does not imply any qualitative requirement to test whether a given period can be accounted as rest.
The exercise that must be carried out is simply one of counting up the relevant hours, days or seven day periods and ensuring that the worker is not required to work during those periods.
There is no indication anywhere that the WTD was concerned about the quality of the minimum periods of rest, other than to make it clear in the definition of rest period that it means a period which is not working time[21].
The contract in question is a contract for the whole of the year, in which the employees were required to work for 26 weeks [34].
The purpose of the entitlement to annual leave is to enable the worker to rest and enjoy a period of relaxation and leisure.
The ECJ has not said that a pre ordained rest period, when the worker is free from all obligations to the employer, can never constitute annual leave.
On the contrary, the term rest period simply means any period which is not working time, and any period means every such period irrespective of where the worker is at that time and what he is doing, so long as it is a period when he is not working.
It is plain that any period when the Appellants are on field break onshore will fall into that category [36].
The Respondents are therefore entitled to insist that the Appellants must take their paid annual leave during periods other than their 26 working weeks when they are onshore on field break.
This is permitted by Regulation 13 of the WTR, read in conformity with Article 7 of the WTD [38].
A reference to the CJEU is not necessary in this case.
The meaning to be given to article 7, for the purposes of this judgment, is not open to any doubt [43].
"
uksc-2014-0089,"The law of vicarious liability is on the move.
So Lord Phillips said, in the last judgment which he delivered as President of this court, in Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56; [2013] 2 AC 1 (the Christian Brothers case), para 19.
It has not yet come to a stop.
This appeal, and the companion appeal in Mohamud v WM Morrison Supermarkets plc [2016] UKSC 11, provide an opportunity to take stock of where it has got to so far.
The scope of vicarious liability depends upon the answers to two questions.
First, what sort of relationship has to exist between an individual and a defendant before the defendant can be made vicariously liable in tort for the conduct of that individual? Secondly, in what manner does the conduct of that individual have to be related to that relationship, in order for vicarious liability to be imposed on the defendant? Although the answers to those questions are inter connected, the present appeal is concerned with the first question, and approaches it principally in the light of the judgment in the Christian Brothers case, where the same issue was considered.
The appeal in the case of Mohamud is concerned with the second question, and approaches it principally in the light of the historical development of this branch of the law.
As will appear, the present judgment also seeks to relate the approach adopted to the first question to ideas which have long been present in the law.
The two judgments are intended to be complementary.
The first question arises in this case in relation to a public authority performing statutory functions for the public benefit, on the one hand, and an individual whose activities form part of the means by which the authority performs its functions, on the other hand.
Specifically, the question is whether the prison service, which is an executive agency of the appellant, the Ministry of Justice, is vicariously liable for the act of a prisoner in the course of his work in a prison kitchen, where the act is negligent and causes injury to a member of the prison staff.
The accident
At the material time the respondent, Mrs Cox, worked as the catering manager at HM Prison Swansea.
She had day to day charge of all aspects of catering at the prison, including the operation of the kitchen, where meals were produced for the prisoners.
She was in charge of four members of staff.
There were also about 20 prisoners who worked in the kitchen and came under her supervision.
On 10 September 2007 Mrs Cox was working in the kitchen with a catering assistant and about 20 prisoners.
Some kitchen supplies were delivered to the ground floor of the prison, and Mrs Cox instructed four prisoners to take them upstairs to the kitchen stores.
During the course of this operation, a sack of rice was dropped by one of the prisoners and burst open.
Mrs Cox bent down to prop it up and prevent spillage.
While she was bent over, another prisoner, Mr Inder, attempted to carry two sacks past her, lost his balance, and dropped one of the sacks on to Mrs Coxs back, causing her injury.
It is accepted that Mr Inder was negligent.
The relevant legislation and practice
Rule 31(1) of the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999/728) provides that a convicted prisoner shall be required to do useful work for not more than ten hours a day.
In terms of rule 31(3), no prisoner shall be set to do work not authorised by the Secretary of State.
Those provisions apply to prisoners detained in privately operated prisons as well as to those operated by the prison service.
The Ministrys current policy in relation to prisoners work is explained in the Green Paper, Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders (2010) (Cm 7972).
According to that document, the Ministry wants prisons to use the discipline and routine of regular working hours to instil an ethos of hard work into prisoners.
Prison should be a place where work is central to the regime, and where offenders learn vocational skills in environments organised to replicate, as far as practical and appropriate, real working conditions.
The document speaks of the working prison, where prisoners work a full working week, and education is geared primarily to providing prisoners with skills enabling them to perform work effectively and to get a job on release.
It is said that, in public prisons, 9,000 prisoners are employed in prison workshops, with many more doing essential jobs to help prisons run smoothly.
Work may be provided either by the prison or by external providers in the private, voluntary and community sectors.
Prisoners may work either inside or outside the prison.
In the latter situation, they may undertake voluntary or charitable work, or may undertake paid work for outside employers.
Work within a prison kitchen, in particular, is regarded as providing a good working environment, with regular hours and the ability to gain nationally recognised vocational qualifications.
Prisoners can apply to work in the kitchen, and a selection is made after relevant assessments have been carried out, including a risk assessment considering such matters as the prisoners temperament, potential security implications, any relevant medical or hygiene problems, and the need for any relevant training in relation to such matters as manual lifting or other skills.
At Swansea in particular, prisoners were assessed for their suitability to work in the kitchen by the Inmate Regime Employment Board, a panel which carried out risk assessments and decided where prisoners should work around the prison.
Those selected for work in the kitchen numbered about 20, out of a total of about 400 prisoners.
They received instruction and training in relation to such matters as food hygiene, the safe use of kitchen equipment and other aspects of safety at work.
Each prisoner had a training record to show what instruction he had received.
The prisoners worked alongside civilian catering staff as part of the team comprising the catering department, and were accountable to the catering manager and the other civilian staff.
They were subject to day to day supervision by the catering staff, and could be removed from the catering department in the event that their performance was unsatisfactory.
Mr Inders instructions required him to work a six day week, from 8.30 am to 5 pm each day, with a break for lunch.
Under rule 31(6) of the Prison Rules, prisoners may be paid for their work at rates approved by the Secretary of State.
It is the Ministrys policy, as set out in Prison Service Order No 4460 (the PSO), entitled Prisoners Pay, that all prisoners who participate in purposeful activity must be paid.
The purpose of paying prisoners is explained as being to encourage and reward their constructive participation in the regime of the establishment.
Prisoners doing work in pursuance of prison rules are expressly excluded from the scope of the national minimum wage: National Minimum Wage Act 1998, section 45.
At the time of the accident, Mr Inder was paid 11.55 per week.
If prisoners did not work in the catering department, additional costs would have to be incurred in employing staff or engaging contractors.
The PSO also states that prison governors are legally required to deduct national insurance contributions and income tax from the earnings of prisoners whose wages exceed the thresholds, and to pay employers national insurance contributions.
Notwithstanding the terms of the PSO, it was the Ministrys position in this appeal that there was no liability to tax or national insurance on the earnings of prisoners working within prisons under prison rules.
That was disputed on behalf of Mrs Cox, but it is unnecessary to resolve the issue.
Whether vicarious liability should be imposed does not depend on the classification of the relationship for the purposes of taxation or national insurance.
It is also relevant to note the legislative provisions concerned with the provision of meals in prisons.
In terms of rule 24 of the Prison Rules, no prisoner shall be allowed to have any food other than that ordinarily provided, subject to specified exceptions.
Prisoners therefore depend on the prison service to be fed.
Section 51 of the Prison Act 1952 provides that all expenses incurred in the maintenance of prisoners (an expression which is defined by section 53(2) as including all necessary expenses incurred for food) shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by Parliament.
The history of the proceedings
The claim was heard by His Honour Judge Keyser QC in the Swansea County Court.
In a judgment given on 3 May 2013, he found that the accident occurred because Mr Inder had failed to take reasonable care for Mrs Coxs safety, but dismissed the claim on the basis that the prison service was not vicariously liable for Mr Inders negligence.
On the basis of a careful review of the law on vicarious liability, as stated in particular at paras 35 and 47 of Lord Phillipss judgment in the Christian Brothers case, he focused on the question whether the relationship between the prison service and Mr Inder was akin to that between an employer and an employee.
He concluded that it was not.
Although he accepted that there were some respects in which the prison services relationship with Mr Inder resembled employment, he considered that there was a crucial difference.
Employment was a voluntary relationship, in which each party acted for its own advantage.
The employer employed the employee as the means by which the employers undertaking or enterprise was carried on and furthered.
The position regarding prisoners at work was quite different.
The prison authorities were legally required to offer work to prisoners.
They were required, by the policy set out in the Prison Service Order, to make payment for that work.
Those requirements were not a matter of voluntary enterprise but of penal policy.
The provision of work was a matter of prison discipline, of prisoners rehabilitation, and possibly of discharging the prisoners obligations to the community.
Although the work done by prisoners might contribute to the efficient and economical operation of the prison, the situation was not one in which prisoners were furthering the business undertaking of the prison service.
An appeal against that decision was allowed by the Court of Appeal: [2014] EWCA Civ 132; [2015] QB 107.
McCombe LJ, giving a judgment with which Beatson and Sharp LJJ agreed, focused like the judge on paras 35 and 47 of the Christian Brothers case, and in particular on the five features listed by Lord Phillips in para 35.
He observed that the work performed by prisoners in the kitchen was essential to the functioning of the prison, and if not done by prisoners would have to be done by someone else.
It was therefore done on behalf of the prison service and for its benefit.
It was part of the enterprise or business of the prison service in running the prison.
In short, the prison service took the benefit of this work, and there was no reason why it should not take its burdens.
Although the relationship differed from a normal employment relationship in that the prisoners were bound to the prison service not by contract but by their sentences, and also in that the prisoners wages were nominal, those differences rendered the relationship if anything closer than one of employment: it was founded not on mutuality but on compulsion.
The Christian Brothers case
Vicarious liability in tort is imposed upon a person in respect of the act or omission of another individual, because of his relationship with that individual, and the connection between that relationship and the act or omission in question.
Leaving aside other areas of the law where vicarious liability can operate, such as partnership and agency (with which this judgment is not concerned), the relationship is classically one of employment, and the connection is that the employee committed the act or omission in the course of his employment: that is to say, within the field of activities assigned to him, as Lord Cullen put it in Central Motors (Glasgow) Ltd v Cessnock Garage & Motor Co 1925 SC 796, 802, or, adapting the words of Diplock LJ in Ilkiw v Samuels [1963] 1 WLR 991, 1004, in the course of his job, considered broadly.
That aspect of vicarious liability is fully considered by Lord Toulson in the case of Mohamud.
It has however long been recognised that a relationship can give rise to vicarious liability even in the absence of a contract of employment.
For example, where an employer lends his employee to a third party, the third party may be treated as the employer for the purposes of vicarious liability.
In recent years, the courts have sought to explain more generally the basis on which vicarious liability can arise out of a relationship other than that of employer and employee.
The general approach to be adopted in deciding whether a relationship other than one of employment can give rise to vicarious liability, subject to there being a sufficient connection between that relationship and the tort in question, was explained by this court in the Christian Brothers case, in a judgment given by Lord Phillips with which the other members of the court agreed.
That judgment was intended to bring greater clarity to an area of the law which had been unsettled by a number of recent decisions, including those of the House of Lords in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22; [2002] 1 AC 215 and Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48; [2003] 2 AC 366.
The case concerned the question whether the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, an international unincorporated association whose mission was to provide children with a Christian education, was vicariously liable for the sexual abuse of children by members of the institute, otherwise known as brothers, who taught at an approved school.
Another organisation managed the school and employed the brothers as teachers.
It had been held to be vicariously liable for the abuse.
The issue was whether the institute was also vicariously liable.
The Supreme Court held that it was.
Vicarious liability was thus imposed on a body which did not employ the wrongdoers, in circumstances where another body did employ them and was also vicariously liable for the same tort.
At para 35 of his judgment, Lord Phillips stated: The relationship that gives rise to vicarious liability is in the vast majority of cases that of employer and employee under a contract of employment.
The employer will be vicariously liable when the employee commits a tort in the course of his employment.
There is no difficulty in identifying a number of policy reasons that usually make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability on the employer when these criteria are satisfied: (i) the employer is more likely to have the means to compensate the victim than the employee and can be expected to have insured against that liability; (ii) the tort will have been committed as a result of activity being taken by the employee on behalf of the employer; (iii) the employees activity is likely to be part of the business activity of the employer; (iv) the employer, by employing the employee to carry on the activity will have created the risk of the tort committed by the employee; (v) the employee will, to a greater or lesser degree, have been under the control of the employer.
At para 35 above, I have identified those incidents of the relationship between employer and employee that make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability on a defendant.
Where the defendant and the tortfeasor are not bound by a contract of employment, but their relationship has the same incidents, that relationship can properly give rise to vicarious liability on the ground that it is akin to that between an employer and an employee.
At para 47, he added:
The five factors which Lord Phillips mentioned in para 35 are not all equally significant.
The first that the defendant is more likely than the tortfeasor to have the means to compensate the victim, and can be expected to have insured against vicarious liability did not feature in the remainder of the judgment, and is unlikely to be of independent significance in most cases.
It is, of course, true that where an individual is employed under a contract of employment, his employer is likely to have a deeper pocket, and can in any event be expected to have insured against vicarious liability.
Neither of these, however, is a principled justification for imposing vicarious liability.
The mere possession of wealth is not in itself any ground for imposing liability.
As for insurance, employers insure themselves because they are liable: they are not liable because they have insured themselves.
On the other hand, given the infinite variety of circumstances in which the question of vicarious liability might arise, it cannot be ruled out that there might be circumstances in which the absence or unavailability of insurance, or other means of meeting a potential liability, might be a relevant consideration.
The fifth of the factors that the tortfeasor will, to a greater or lesser degree, have been under the control of the defendant no longer has the significance that it was sometimes considered to have in the past, as Lord Phillips immediately made clear.
As he explained at para 36, the ability to direct how an individual did his work was sometimes regarded as an important test of the existence of a relationship of master and servant, and came to be treated at times as the test for the imposition of vicarious liability.
But it is not realistic in modern life to look for a right to direct how an employee should perform his duties as a necessary element in the relationship between employer and employee; nor indeed was it in times gone by, if one thinks for example of the degree of control which the owner of a ship could have exercised over the master while the ship was at sea.
Accordingly, as Lord Phillips stated, the significance of control is that the defendant can direct what the tortfeasor does, not how he does it.
So understood, it is a factor which is unlikely to be of independent significance in most cases.
On the other hand, the absence of even that vestigial degree of control would be liable to negative the imposition of vicarious liability.
The remaining factors listed by Lord Phillips were that (1) the tort will have been committed as a result of activity being taken by the tortfeasor on behalf of the defendant, (2) the tortfeasors activity is likely to be part of the business activity of the defendant, and (3) the defendant, by employing the tortfeasor to carry on the activity, will have created the risk of the tort committed by the tortfeasor.
These three factors are inter related.
The first has been reflected historically in explanations of the vicarious liability of employers based on deemed authorisation or delegation, as for example in Turberville v Stampe (1698) 1 Ld Raym 264, 265 per Holt CJ and Bartonshill Coal Co v McGuire (1858) 3 Macq 300, 306 per Lord Chelmsford LC.
The second, that the tortfeasors activity is likely to be an integral part of the business activity of the defendant, has long been regarded as a justification for the imposition of vicarious liability on employers, on the basis that, since the employees activities are undertaken as part of the activities of the employer and for its benefit, it is appropriate that the employer should bear the cost of harm wrongfully done by the employee within the field of activities assigned to him: see, for example, Duncan v Findlater (1839) 6 Cl & Fin 894, 909 910; (1839) MacL & Rob 911, 940 per Lord Brougham and Broom v Morgan [1953] 1 QB 597, 607 608 per Denning LJ.
The third factor, that the defendant, by employing the tortfeasor to carry on the activities, will have created the risk of the tort committed by the tortfeasor, is very closely related to the second: since the risk of an individual behaving negligently, or indeed committing an intentional wrong, is a fact of life, anyone who employs others to carry out activities is likely to create the risk of their behaving tortiously within the field of activities assigned to them.
The essential idea is that the defendant should be liable for torts that may fairly be regarded as risks of his business activities, whether they are committed for the purpose of furthering those activities or not.
This idea has been emphasised in recent times in United States and Canadian authorities, sometimes in the context of an economic analysis, but has much older roots, as I have explained.
It was reaffirmed in the cases of Lister and Dubai Aluminium.
In the latter case, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said at para 21: The underlying legal policy is based on the recognition that carrying on a business enterprise necessarily involves risks to others.
It involves the risk that others will be harmed by wrongful acts committed by the agents through whom the business is carried on.
When those risks ripen into loss, it is just that the business should be responsible for compensating the person who has been wronged.
Lord Phillipss analysis in the Christian Brothers case wove together these related ideas so as to develop a modern theory of vicarious liability.
The result of this approach is that a relationship other than one of employment is in principle capable of giving rise to vicarious liability where harm is wrongfully done by an individual who carries on activities as an integral part of the business activities carried on by a defendant and for its benefit (rather than his activities being entirely attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of his own or of a third party), and where the commission of the wrongful act is a risk created by the defendant by assigning those activities to the individual in question.
Lord Phillips illustrated the approach which I have described by considering two earlier cases in the Court of Appeal.
He discussed first its decision in Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1151; [2006] QB 510.
That case concerned a situation of a kind which commonly arises in modern workplaces.
Employees of the third defendants were supplied to the second defendants on a labour only basis, under a contract between the two companies, and worked under the supervision of a self employed person also working under a contract with the second defendant.
The question was whether the second defendant, as well as the third, was vicariously liable for the negligence of the employees in the course of their employment.
The Court of Appeal agreed that it was, but for different reasons: May LJ considered that the imposition of vicarious liability depended on who had the right to control the employees activities, whereas Rix LJ formulated a test which was based not on control, but on the integration of the employees into the employers business enterprise.
He stated that vicarious liability was imposed because the employer was treated as picking up the burden of an organisational or business relationship which he had undertaken for his own benefit.
Accordingly, what one was looking for was a situation where the employee in question, at any rate for relevant purposes, is so much a part of the work, business or organisation of both employers that it is just to make both employers answer for his negligence: p 537.
Lord Phillips endorsed the approach of Rix LJ.
Lord Phillips next considered the decision of the Court of Appeal in E v English Province of Our Lady of Charity [2012] EWCA Civ 938; [2013] QB 722.
In that case, a diocesan trust, treated as being equivalent to the diocesan bishop, was held to be vicariously liable for sexual abuse committed by a Roman Catholic priest when visiting a childrens home in the diocese, on the basis that the relationship between the priest and the Roman Catholic Church was akin to employment.
Lord Phillips summarised Ward LJs approach as asking whether the workman was working on behalf of an enterprise or on his own behalf and, if the former, how central the workmans activities were to the enterprise and whether these activities were integrated into the organisational structure of the enterprise.
Ward LJ found it possible to describe the relationship between the bishop and the priest as being akin to employment, as Lord Phillips put it, by treating the ministry of the Roman Catholic Church as a business carried on by the bishop, by finding that the priest carried on that business under a degree of control by the bishop and by finding that the priest was part and parcel of the organisation of the business and integrated into it: [2013] 2 AC 1, paras 49, 54.
Lord Phillips then considered the facts of the Christian Brothers case itself.
In the context of vicarious liability, the relationship between the institute and the brothers had all the essential elements of the relationship between an employer and employees.
The institute was subdivided into a hierarchical structure and conducted its activities as if it were a corporate body.
The teaching activity of the brothers was undertaken because the local administration of the institute directed the brothers to undertake it.
It was undertaken by the brothers in furtherance of the objective, or mission, of the institute.
The manner in which the brothers were obliged to conduct themselves as teachers was dictated by the institutes rules.
The relationship between the brothers and the institute differed from that between employer and employee in that the brothers were bound to the institute not by contract but by their vows, and in that, far from the institute paying the brothers, the brothers were obliged to transfer all their earnings to the institute.
Neither of these differences was material.
Indeed, they rendered the relationship between the brothers and the institute closer than that of an employer and its employees.
The relationship was therefore sufficiently akin to that of employer and employee to be capable of giving rise to vicarious liability.
The three cases which I have discussed illustrate the general approach set out by Lord Phillips at paras 35 and 47 of the Christian Brothers case.
It may be said that the criteria are insufficiently precise to make their application to borderline cases plain and straightforward: a criticism which might, of course, also be made of other general principles of the law of tort.
As Lord Nicholls observed in Dubai Aluminium at para 26, a lack of precision is inevitable, given the infinite range of circumstances where the issue arises.
The court has to make a judgment, assisted by previous judicial decisions in the same or analogous contexts.
Such decisions may enable the criteria to be refined in particular contexts, as Lord Phillips suggested in the Christian Brothers case at para 83.
It is important, however, to understand that the general approach which Lord Phillips described is not confined to some special category of cases, such as the sexual abuse of children.
It is intended to provide a basis for identifying the circumstances in which vicarious liability may in principle be imposed outside relationships of employment.
By focusing upon the business activities carried on by the defendant and their attendant risks, it directs attention to the issues which are likely to be relevant in the context of modern workplaces, where workers may in reality be part of the workforce of an organisation without having a contract of employment with it, and also reflects prevailing ideas about the responsibility of businesses for the risks which are created by their activities.
It results in an extension of the scope of vicarious liability beyond the responsibility of an employer for the acts and omissions of its employees in the course of their employment, but not to the extent of imposing such liability where a tortfeasors activities are entirely attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of his own or of a third party.
An important consequence of that extension is to enable the law to maintain previous levels of protection for the victims of torts, notwithstanding changes in the legal relationships between enterprises and members of their workforces which may be motivated by factors which have nothing to do with the nature of the enterprises activities or the attendant risks.
It is also important not to be misled by a narrow focus on semantics: for example, by words such as business, benefit, and enterprise.
The defendant need not be carrying on activities of a commercial nature: that is apparent not only from the cases of E and the Christian Brothers, but also from the long established application of vicarious liability to public authorities and hospitals.
It need not therefore be a business or enterprise in any ordinary sense.
Nor need the benefit which it derives from the tortfeasors activities take the form of a profit.
It is sufficient that there is a defendant which is carrying on activities in the furtherance of its own interests.
The individual for whose conduct it may be vicariously liable must carry on activities assigned to him by the defendant as an integral part of its operation and for its benefit.
The defendant must, by assigning those activities to him, have created a risk of his committing the tort.
As the cases of Viasystems, E and the Christian Brothers show, a wide range of circumstances can satisfy those requirements.
The other lesson to be drawn from the cases of Viasystems, E and the Christian Brothers is that defendants cannot avoid vicarious liability on the basis of technical arguments about the employment status of the individual who committed the tort.
As Professor John Bell noted in his article, The Basis of Vicarious Liability [2013] CLJ 17, what weighed with the courts in E and the Christian Brothers case was that the abusers were placed by the organisations in question, as part of their mission, in a position in which they committed a tort whose commission was a risk inherent in the activities assigned to them.
The present case
In the present case, the requirements laid down in the Christian Brothers case are met.
The prison service carries on activities in furtherance of its aims.
The fact that those aims are not commercially motivated, but serve the public interest, is no bar to the imposition of vicarious liability.
Prisoners working in the prison kitchens, such as Mr Inder, are integrated into the operation of the prison, so that the activities assigned to them by the prison service form an integral part of the activities which it carries on in the furtherance of its aims: in particular, the activity of providing meals for prisoners.
They are placed by the prison service in a position where there is a risk that they may commit a variety of negligent acts within the field of activities assigned to them.
That is recognised by the health and safety training which they receive.
Furthermore, they work under the direction of prison staff.
Mrs Cox was injured as a result of negligence by Mr Inder in carrying on the activities assigned to him.
The prison service is therefore vicariously liable to her.
A number of arguments were advanced against that conclusion on behalf of the Ministry.
First and foremost, it was argued, on a number of grounds, that the relationship between the prison service and prisoners working in a prison is fundamentally different from that between a private employer and its employees.
The primary purpose of the prison service, in setting prisoners to work in prison, is not to advance any business or enterprise of the prison, but to support the rehabilitation of the prisoners as an aim of penal policy.
It does not seek to make a profit, but acts in the public interest.
Unlike employees, the prisoners have no interest in furthering the objectives of the prison service.
Even in the Christian Brothers case, the interests of the institute and the brothers were in alignment.
I am unable to accept this argument.
It is true that the prison service seeks to rehabilitate prisoners, and that setting them to work is one of the means by which it attempts to achieve that objective.
Rehabilitation is, however, not its only objective: it has also been an aim of penal policy since at least the nineteenth century to ensure, as it was put in a 1991 White Paper, that convicted prisoners contribute to the cost of their upkeep by helping with the running and maintenance of the prison and by providing goods and services in prison industries and on prison farms: Custody , Care and Justice: The Way Ahead for the Prison Service in England and Wales (1991) (Cm 1647), para 7.22.
More importantly, when prisoners work in the prison kitchen, or in other workplaces such as the gardens or the laundry, they are integrated into the operation of the prison.
The activities assigned to them are not merely of benefit to themselves: a benefit which is, moreover, merely potential and indirect.
Their activities form part of the operation of the prison, and are of direct and immediate benefit to the prison service itself.
As for the other points, I have already explained that it is not essential to the imposition of vicarious liability that the defendant should seek to make a profit.
Nor does vicarious liability depend upon an alignment of the objectives of the defendant and of the individual who committed the act or omission in question.
It would be as nave to imagine that all employees are subjectively committed to the interests of their employer as to imagine that no prisoner working in a prison kitchen derives any satisfaction from doing his job well or from obtaining the vocational qualifications available to him.
The fact that a prisoner is required to serve part of his sentence in prison, and to undertake useful work there for nominal wages, binds him into a closer relationship with the prison service than would be the case for an employee.
It strengthens, rather than weakens, the case for imposing vicarious liability.
Secondly, other aspects of the relationship between the prison service and prisoners were said to differ from the characteristics of an ordinary employment relationship.
The prison service was under a duty to provide useful work for prisoners.
Its choice of workers was restricted to the prisoners who happened to be held there.
In that regard, it was pointed out that the courts had not imposed vicarious liability in respect of compulsory pilotage, where the master of the ship was compelled to surrender the navigation of his vessel to a pilot and had no power of selection.
Furthermore, the prisoners pay was not a commercial wage, but a payment intended to motivate them.
These differences do not lead to the conclusion that vicarious liability should not be imposed, applying the approach approved in the Christian Brothers case.
The fact that the incentive payments made to prisoners are below the level of a commercial wage reflects the context in which prisoners work, but does not entail that vicarious liability should not be imposed.
The Christian Brothers case demonstrates that the payment of a wage is not essential.
The fact that the prison service, and the operators of contracted out prisons, are under a statutory duty to provide prisoners with useful work, is not incompatible with the imposition of vicarious liability.
The legislation does not itself exclude the imposition of vicarious liability.
Nor is it argued that any distinct point arises under section 2(1)(a) of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, in terms of which the Crown is subject to all those liabilities in tort to which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be subject in respect of torts committed by its servants or agents.
Authorities concerned with compulsory pilotage are not in point: the prison service is not required to provide particular types of employment, or to allocate particular prisoners to particular activities.
In practice, prisoners can be allocated to a variety of workplaces both inside and outside prisons, having regard to the relevant risks.
More particularly, the prison service is not compelled to employ prisoners in the kitchen, and has a meaningful power of selection in respect of the prisoners it chooses to employ there.
It appears from the evidence that the prison service takes particular care when selecting prisoners who are suitable to work in the kitchen, having regard to the risks involved in that setting.
A restricted pool from which to select a workforce was a feature of the Christian Brothers case, and is not uncommon even in ordinary cases of employment: an employer can only select from those who apply for appointment, and may often have a small pool from which to choose.
Thirdly, it was argued that to hold the prison service vicariously liable for the acts of a prisoner would be a major development of the common law, which should be developed by the courts only cautiously.
It does not appear to me that this case involves a major development of the law.
The conclusion which I have reached follows from the application of the approach laid down in the Christian Brothers case.
Fourthly, it was argued that it was always necessary to ask the broader question whether it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability.
In that regard, reliance was placed on the fact that the prison service acts for the benefit of the public, and on the fact that any liability would have to be met out of scarce public funds.
It was also argued that there was no justification for imposing vicarious liability on the prison service in addition to its common law duty of care towards Mrs Cox, and its various statutory duties.
I do not consider that it is always necessary to ask the broader question.
The criteria for the imposition of vicarious liability listed by Lord Phillips in the Christian Brothers case are designed, as he made clear at paras 34, 35 and 47, to ensure that it is imposed where it is fair, just and reasonable to do so.
That was the whole point of seeking to align the criteria with the various policy justifications for its imposition.
As I have explained, the criteria may be capable of refinement in particular contexts.
But in cases where the criteria are satisfied, it should not generally be necessary to re assess the fairness, justice and reasonableness of the result in the particular case.
Such an exercise, if carried out routinely, would be liable to lead to uncertainty and inconsistency.
At the same time, the criteria are not to be applied mechanically or slavishly.
As Lady Hale rightly observed in Woodland v Swimming Teachers Association [2013] UKSC 66; [2014] AC 537 at para 28, the words used by judges are not to be treated as if they were the words of a statute.
Where a case concerns circumstances which have not previously been the subject of an authoritative judicial decision, it may be valuable to stand back and consider whether the imposition of vicarious liability would be fair, just and reasonable.
The present appeal is such a case.
On considering the matter, however, I do not regard the conclusion which I have reached as unreasonable or unjust.
Those adjectives might more aptly describe a situation in which Mrs Coxs ability to obtain compensation for the injury she suffered at work depended entirely on whether the member of the catering team who dropped the bag of rice on her back happened to be a prisoner or a civilian member of staff.
For the prison service to be liable to compensate a victim of negligence by a member of the prison catering team appears to me to be just and reasonable whether the negligent member of the team is a civilian or a prisoner.
Finally, like the Fat Boy in The Pickwick Papers, counsel sought to make our flesh creep.
It was argued that, if the present claim succeeded, there would be similar claims arising from the other activities undertaken by prisoners with a view to their rehabilitation, such as educational classes or offending behaviour programmes.
There was also a risk of fraudulent claims being made for prisoner on prisoner incidents.
A finding of vicarious liability might lead the prison service to adopt an unduly cautious approach to the type of tasks which prisoners were given the opportunity to do, given the potential impact on scarce financial resources.
I am not persuaded by these apprehensions.
It is true that prisoners who participate in educational classes or offending behaviour programmes contribute towards their own rehabilitation, and in that sense may be said to be acting in furtherance of one of the aims of the prison service.
But there is an intelligible distinction between taking part in activities of that kind and working as an integral part of the operation of the prison and for its benefit.
As for the risk of fraudulent claims, that risk is inherent in the law relating to compensation for personal injuries, and employers, insurers and the courts are all experienced in guarding against it.
As for the risk of an unduly cautious approach being adopted by the prison service, that risk is entirely speculative, and is based on a consideration only of the costs potentially resulting from the imposition of vicarious liability, without taking account of the costs which would result from a decision to cease employing prisoners and instead to employ civilian staff or external contractors at market rates of pay.
I would dismiss this appeal.
","The Respondent, Mrs Cox, worked as the catering manager at HM Prison Swansea.
She was in charge of all aspects of the catering, including the operation of the kitchen producing meals for prisoners.
She supervised prisoners who worked in the kitchen alongside other civilian catering staff.
On 10 September 2007 Mrs Cox instructed some prisoners to take some kitchen supplies to the kitchen stores.
During the course of this operation, one of the prisoners, Mr Inder, accidentally dropped a sack of rice onto Mrs Coxs back, injuring her.
Mrs Cox brought a claim against the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in the Swansea County Court.
His Honour Judge Keyser QC found that Mr Inder was negligent, but dismissed the claim on the basis that the prison service, which is an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, was not vicariously liable as the relationship between the prison service and Mr Inder was not akin to that between an employer and an employee.
The Court of Appeal reversed the decision, finding that the prison service was vicariously liable for Mr Inders negligence.
The question on the MOJs appeal to the Supreme Court concerns the sort of relationship which has to exist between an individual and a defendant before the defendant can be made vicariously liable in tort for the conduct of that individual.
This case was heard alongside Mohamud v WM Morrison Supermarkets plc [2016] UKSC 11 which addresses the question of how the conduct of the individual has to be related to that relationship, in order for vicarious liability to be imposed on the defendant.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the Ministry of Justices appeal.
Lord Reed gives the lead judgment, with which the other Justices agree.
Lord Reed gives guidance on the sort of relationship which may give rise to vicarious liability.
In Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56, (the Christian Brothers case), Lord Phillips mentioned five factors which make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability on a defendant, where the defendant and the tortfeasor are not bound by a contract of employment [19].
Lord Reed explains that these five factors are not equally significant.
The first factor, that the defendant is more likely to have the means to compensate the victim and can be expected to have insured against vicarious liability, is unlikely to be of independent significance in most cases [20].
The fifth factor, that the tortfeasor will have been under the control of the defendant, no longer has the significance it was sometimes considered to have.
In modern life, it is not realistic to look for a right to direct how an employee should perform his duties as a necessary element in the employment relationship [21].
The remaining three factors are inter related.
These are (1) the tort will have been committed as a result of activity being taken by the tortfeasor on behalf of the defendant; (2) the tortfeasors activity is likely to be part of the business activity of the defendant; and (3) the defendant,
by employing the tortfeasor to carry on the activity, will have created the risk of the tort committed by the tortfeasor [22].
A relationship other than one of employment is in principle capable of giving rise to vicarious liability where harm is wrongfully done by an individual who carries on activities as an integral part of the defendants business and for its benefit (rather than his activities being entirely attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of his own or of a third party), and where the commission of the wrongful act is a risk created by the defendant by assigning those activities to that individual [24].
The general approach described in Christian Brothers is not confined to a special category of cases, but provides a basis for identifying the circumstances in which vicarious liability may in principle be imposed outside employment relationships.
It extends the scope of vicarious liability beyond the responsibility of an employer for the acts and omissions of its employees in the course of their employment, but not to the extent of imposing such liability where a tortfeasors activities are entirely attributable to the conduct of a recognisably independent business of his own, or of a third party.
This enables the law to maintain previous levels of protection for the victims of torts, despite changes in the legal relationships between enterprises and members of their workforces which may be motivated by factors extraneous to the enterprises activities or attendant risks [29].
The defendant need not be carrying on activities of a commercial nature.
The benefit which it derives from the tortfeasors activities need not take the form of a profit.
It is sufficient that there is a defendant carrying on activities in the furtherance of its own interests.
The individual for whose conduct it may be vicariously liable must carry on activities assigned to him by the defendant as an integral part of its operation and for its benefit.
The defendant must, by assigning those activities to the tortfeasor, have created a risk of his committing the tort [30].
A wide range of circumstances can satisfy those requirements, and defendants cannot avoid vicarious liability on the basis of arguments about the employment status of the tortfeasor [31].
Prisoners working in kitchens are integrated into the operation of the prison.
The activities assigned to them form an integral part of the activities the prison carries on in the furtherance of its aims, in particular the provision of meals to prisoners.
The fact that these aims serve the public interest is not a bar to the imposition of vicarious liability.
The prison service places these prisoners in a position where there is a risk that they may commit a variety of negligent acts in carrying out assigned activities, which is recognised by the provision of health and safety training.
The prisoners work under the direction of prison staff.
Mrs Cox was injured as a result of Mr Inders negligence in carrying on activities assigned to him, and the prison service is therefore vicariously liable to her [32].
The MOJs arguments that requiring prisoners to work serves the purpose of rehabilitation and that the prisoners have no interest in furthering the objectives of the prison service are rejected.
Rehabilitation is not the sole objective.
Penal policy also aims to ensure that convicted prisoners contribute to the cost of their upkeep.
When prisoners work in the prison kitchen they are integrated into the operation of the prison, and their activities are of direct and immediate benefit to the prison service itself [34].
The fact that a prisoner is required to undertake work for nominal wages binds him into a closer relationship with the prison service than would be the case for an employee, and strengthens the case for imposing vicarious liability [35].
Payment of a wage is not essential for the imposition of vicarious liability [37].
Nor is it necessary for the prison to have an unrestricted pool from which to select a workforce.
The prisoners who work in the kitchen are selected with particular care, having regard to the risks involved [38].
In cases where the criteria set out in Christian Brothers are satisfied, it should not generally be necessary to re assess the fairness, justice and reasonableness of the result.
The criteria are designed to ensure that vicarious liability is imposed where it is fair, just and reasonable to do so [41].
"
uksc-2010-0189,"The appeal raises a short issue of construction under the planning Acts, on which differing views have been expressed by experienced planning judges in the courts below.
It arises in the context of a planning permission granted by the respondent council for four blocks of student accommodation in proximity to a site used for storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
The question, as agreed by counsel for the purposes of the appeal, is: In considering under section 97 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 whether it appears to a local planning authority to be expedient to revoke or modify a permission to develop land, is it always open to that local planning authority to have regard to the compensation that it would or might have to pay under section 107? The Court of Appeal by a majority (Longmore and Sullivan LJJ, Pill LJ dissenting) [2011] PTSR 645 decided it in the affirmative.
Unusually, the court is asked to consider this question, not in the context of a specific decision of the council to revoke the permission, but as an abstract point of construction in connection with a decision which may or may not be made in the future.
As I understand it, the Court of Appeal has granted permission to appeal on the footing that the point is one of some general importance on which a definitive decision is desirable.
The parties
The Wolverhampton City Council (the council) is the council for a metropolitan borough in the West Midlands.
It is the local planning authority, and also the hazardous substances authority for the relevant area under the Planning (Hazardous Substances) Act 1990 (the PHSA 1990).
The Health & Safety Executive (the HSE) is a statutory non departmental public body, established under the Health and Safety at Work etc.
Act 1974.
It has a general duty under the Act to work with others to secure the health, safety and welfare of people at work, to protect the public against risks to health and safety arising from work activities, and to control dangerous substances.
The statutory regime for the control of hazards involving dangerous substances includes the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/743) (made under European Council Directive 96/82/EC (the Council Directive)).
The HSE together with the Environment Agency is the competent authority under that regime, with responsibility to oversee its operation and to co ordinate the regulation of major hazards.
As part of that role, the HSE sets acceptable levels for particular classes of risk to the health and safety of the population, measured by the probability of a particular occurrence.
The HSE's advice in relation to particular development proposals is, in most cases, generated by a risk model known as Planning Advice for Developments near Hazardous Installations (PADHI).
There is a computer based version of this model, known as PADHI+, which allows local planning authorities to consult and obtain the HSE's advice online by entering various site specific details.
The distance between the hazardous installation and the proposed development is related to three zones (inner, middle and outer), the inner zone posing the greatest risk.
The interested party, Victoria Hall Ltd (the developer), is a private limited company whose main business is the provision of student accommodation, nationally and internationally.
It was represented by counsel in the Court of Appeal, but not in this court.
Statutory provisions
The grant of planning permission is governed by section 70 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the 1990 Act.) Where an application is made to the local planning authority, they may grant permission (conditionally or unconditionally) or refuse permission.
In dealing with the application they must have regard to the provisions of the development plan, so far as material to the application, and to any other material considerations (s 70(2)).
Section 97, which is directly relevant to the appeal, provides: Power to revoke or modify planning permission ""(1) If it appears to the local planning authority that it is expedient to revoke or modify any permission to develop land granted on an application made under this Part, the authority may by order revoke or modify the permission to such an extent as they consider expedient. (2) In exercising their functions under subsection (1) the authority shall have regard to the development plan and to any other material considerations.
In relation to building operations, the power to revoke or modify may be exercised at any time before the operations have been completed, but will not affect those operations so far as previously carried out (section 97(3)(4)).
If there are objections, a revocation order made by a local planning authority is subject to confirmation by the Secretary of State (section 98).
If the order is confirmed, compensation is payable by the authority for abortive expenditure, and for other loss or damage directly attributable to the revocation or modification (section 107).
Section 100 gives the Secretary of State a separate power to make an order under section 97.
Such an order has the same effect as one made by the local planning authority (section 100(2)), with the consequence (inter alia) that the authority, not the Secretary of State, are liable to pay compensation.
Although not directly relevant to this appeal, parallels have been drawn in argument with the provisions of section 102 (and related sections) for discontinuance orders, that is orders for the discontinuance of any use of land, or for the imposition of conditions on any such use.
Under section 102(1) a discontinuance order may be made, if: having regard to the development plan and to any other material considerations, it appears to a local planning authority that [such action] is expedient in the interests of the proper planning of their area (including the interests of amenity) .
Finally, reference should be made to the provisions for hazardous substances consent under the PHSA 1990.
By section 4, subject to certain limits, the presence of a hazardous substance on, over or under land requires a hazardous substances consent.
By section 9, consent may be granted by the hazardous substances authority.
In dealing with an application for consent, the authority is required to have regard to material considerations, which are defined as including in particular the existing and likely future uses of land in the vicinity, and the provisions of the development plan (s 9(2)).
By section 14 the same authority may make an order revoking or modifying such a consent, if it appears to them, having regard to any material considerations, that it is expedient to revoke or modify it.
By section 19, compensation is payable in respect of any loss or damage directly attributable to the revocation or modification.
Background facts
On 4 August 2008, following an application by the developer, the council granted planning permission for the erection of four blocks (blocks A D) of student accommodation on land between Culwell Street and Lock Street, Wolverhampton.
Some 95 metres away from the nearest block (Block D), on the other side of a railway line, there is a LPG facility operated by Carvers LPG (Wolverhampton) Ltd. (Carvers).
LPG is a dangerous substance within the meaning of the Council Directive.
The site accordingly requires, and has been granted, hazardous substances consent under the PHSA 1990.
Because of the proximity of the LPG site, the council was required to consult the HSE on the application.
They did so on line (by PADHI+) and received the following response: The assessment indicates that the risk of harm to people at the proposed Development is such that HSE'S advice is that there are sufficient reasons, on safety grounds, for advising against the granting of planning permission in this case.
This advice was in due course reported to the planning committee by the officers, with an indication that though not mandatory it should not be overridden without careful consideration.
What followed is summarised by Sullivan LJ (para 6): Despite this warning, when considering the planning application Wolverhampton failed to consult further with the HSE, failed to obtain its own advice as to the safety implications of permitting a substantial amount of residential accommodation in this location and, despite being obliged to do so, failed to give the HSE advance notice of its intention to grant planning permission for the development, and failed to notify the HSE that it had granted permission.
The HSE first discovered on 16 December 2008 that planning permission had been granted, over four months after the grant of permission and, since works had commenced prior to the grant of permission, five months after the works had commenced.
By the time the HSE became aware of the development, work on three of the blocks, A, B and C, was well advanced.
Work on block D, which was the closest block to the LPG facility, had not commenced.
Sullivan LJ also described the attempts which were made by the HSE over the following weeks to resolve the issue by agreement with the council and the other interested parties.
They indicated initially that their preferred option would be to relocate the Carvers installation.
But they also pointed out that the councils procedural failures had deprived the HSE of the opportunity to ask the Secretary of State to call in the application for planning permission; and they asked the council to remedy this by making a revocation order under section 97, at least to prevent the construction of block D.
The nature of the discussions between the council and the HSE can be seen from the notes of a meeting on 8 April 2009.
It was recorded that there was a verbal agreement that building of block D would not be started until market conditions improved.
The other blocks were almost complete, in preparation for the first students to take up residence at the beginning of the academic year in October 2009.
The HSE representative identified three options to resolve the problem: (i) revoke the planning permission for blocks in the inner and middle zones; (ii) move Carvers from their site; or (iii) reduce the LPG inventory at the Carvers Site and amend the hazardous substance consent to a lower level. (I take the word amend to be a reference to modification under section 14 of PHSA 1990.)
The councils representative indicated that no decision had yet been taken by the council on any of the options.
The first option (revocation) was considered most unlikely because of the potentially high costs of doing so.
It was noted that any of the options would require compensation, and that there would therefore need to be a dialogue between Carvers and Wolverhampton City Council on how best to achieve a positive outcome.
The HSE representative emphasised the need for a quick decision by the council, and offered technical support for that purpose.
He also advised that the HSE would consider further action, such as judicial review, if a satisfactory response were not received.
Thereafter progress was slow.
On 18 May the HSE restated its wish to resolve the issue urgently and asked the council to indicate whether it was willing to make a revocation order.
The councils reply was terse: The Council has now taken some preliminary legal advice and from a careful consideration of all the information available can see no justification for revoking or modifying the planning permission in question Apart from indicating that they were waiting for further information and would keep the HSE informed, they gave no further reasons for this decision, nor any clear indication of the councils view of the problem, or of how, if not by revocation, they proposed to deal with it.
On 22 June solicitors for the HSE gave the council notice of their intention to seek judicial review both of the grant of planning permission and of the decision not to revoke it.
They noted that no work had yet started on block D, which was entirely within the inner zone.
They suggested two courses open to the council: either to resolve on revocation of the permission in respect of block D, or to consent to the quashing of the permission as a whole.
The HSEs preference was for the latter, because it also had concerns about block C, and would welcome the opportunity to ensure that the whole development could be reconsidered.
In response the council indicated that, having taken leading counsels advice, and in view of the number of people living in the area, and the scope for further development, it was manifest that the most appropriate course is to relocate the installation, if need be compulsorily.
The council would be considering this further with its advisers.
It suggested that the HSE itself might wish to consider such a course.
The HSEs claim form was filed on 9 July.
On 14 October 2009 the matter came before Collins J on a rolled up hearing.
He granted permission to apply for judicial review, but declined to quash either the planning permission or the decision not to revoke.
Instead he ordered the council to provide a full summary of its reasons for granting planning permission and of the policies taken into account, and made a declaration that the council had acted in breach of the procedural regulations in a number of respects.
On the issue of revocation, he noted that this was now impossible in respect of blocks A, B and C, and would be in any event inappropriate because of its serious financial implications for the developer (a relevant factor, as held in Vasiliou v Secretary of State for Transport [1991] 2 All ER 77).
In respect of the HSEs submission that the cost of compensation was not a relevant factor (following Alnwick District Council v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (2000) 79 P & CR 130), he said: I do not need to decide whether this is correct since the impact on the interested party coupled with the completion of three of the four blocks and the reasonable view that the HSE's failure to take immediate action shows that the risk could not be regarded as immediate entirely justifies a refusal to revoke or modify.
Certainly, the refusal cannot be regarded as irrational. (para 40)
The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal in May 2010.
Judgment was given on 30 July.
Sullivan LJ, giving the leading judgment, noted (para 26) the HSEs argument that it had been seeking revocation only in respect of block D, and that in this respect Collins J had proceeded on a false premise.
Sullivan LJ thought that, whatever confusion there might have been about the HSEs own position until the letter of 22 June 2009, it should before then have become clear to the council that the only practical possibility was the revocation of block D; and that this was an option which they should have considered with care (paras 29 30).
Their failure to do so meant that their decision of 29 May 2009 not to make a revocation order was unlawful, and they should be ordered to reconsider (para 38).
On that point the court was unanimous.
As to whether compensation would be a material issue in that reconsideration (the issue now before this court), the Court of Appeal was divided.
Longmore LJ agreed with Sullivan LJ that it was capable in law of being a material factor, and ordered the council to reconsider the issue on that basis.
Pill LJ disagreed.
As already noted, they granted permission to appeal to this court.
I shall return to their reasoning below.
On the material before this court, the position remains that the council has not made a formal decision on whether to make a revocation order in respect of block D. We were told by Mr Griffiths QC on instructions that the council had obtained its own expert advice as to the degree of risk posed by the proximity of the LPG business, and he also gave us some information about the progress of discussions for the relocation of the Carvers business to another site owned by the council.
However, since that information is not in evidence, and the HSE has not had an opportunity to respond to it, I leave it out of account for the purposes of this judgment.
A simple view
I start by looking at the position in general terms, before considering whether there is anything in the particular statute, or the relevant authorities, which requires a different approach.
In simple terms, the question is whether a public authority, when deciding whether to exercise a discretionary power to achieve a public objective, is entitled to take into account the cost to the public of so doing.
Posed in that way, the question answers itself.
As custodian of public funds, the authority not only may, but generally must, have regard to the cost to the public of its actions, at least to the extent of considering in any case whether the cost is proportionate to the aim to be achieved, and taking account of any more economic ways of achieving the same objective.
Of course, the weight attributable to cost considerations will vary with the context.
Where, for example, the authority is faced with an imminent threat to public security within its sphere of responsibility, cost could rarely be a valid reason for doing nothing, but could well be relevant to the choice between effective alternatives.
So much is not only sound administrative practice, but common sense.
Does section 97 require a different approach? On an ordinary reading, the answer must be no.
The section requires the authority to satisfy itself that revocation is expedient, and in so doing to have regard to the development plan and other material considerations.
It is not suggested in this case that the development plan throws any light on this issue.
The other two expressions are, at least at first sight, capable of encompassing the cost consequences of revocation.
The word expedient implies no more than that the action should be appropriate in all the circumstances.
Where one of those circumstances is a potential liability for compensation, it is hard to see why it should be excluded.
Similarly, at least at first sight, there is nothing in the expression material considerations to exclude cost.
Material in ordinary language is the same as relevant.
Where the exercise of the power, in the manner envisaged by the statute, will have both planning and financial consequences, there is no obvious reason to treat either as irrelevant.
The practical sense of this approach is illustrated by the facts of the present case.
The safety concerns highlighted by the HSE would have made it hard for the council to justify doing nothing, at least once there was a risk of block D being built.
But, assuming the need for compulsion, it appears that they had a choice of at least three statutory routes: an order under section 97 of the 1990 Act to prevent the building of block D, an order under section 14 of the PHSA to limit the hazardous substances which could be stored at the LPG site, or a compulsory purchase order to remove the Carvers installation altogether.
Action under any of these powers would result in a claim for compensation, but not necessarily of the same order.
The choice between the options would no doubt involve a range of planning and other issues, but it would be curious if comparative cost could not be at least one factor in the overall balance.
Authorities
The principal authority relied for the contrary view, which had the support of Pill LJ in the present case, is the judgment of Richards J in the Alnwick District Council case 79 P & CR 130.
The district council had granted permission for a large superstore, under a misapprehension as to the size of what was proposed, and in contravention (as the inspector found) of national planning policy.
In the face of the councils objections, the Secretary of State made a revocation order, the compensation for which (estimated at 3 4m) would fall on the council.
The inspector described the decision as grossly wrong and seriously perverse, and likely to cause significant harm to Alnwicks vitality and viability as a shopping centre.
He indicated that he regarded the issue of compensation as irrelevant.
The Secretary of State adopted his reasoning.
The council applied to the High Court to quash the order.
The principal argument was that liability for compensation of this order would put the council in severe financial difficulties, and in particular would put at risk a planned development of leisure facilities elsewhere in the district.
This argument had been touched on only lightly at the inquiry, and seems to have been developed largely by counsel in the High Court.
The Secretary of State submitted that compensation was irrelevant as a matter of law, but also that, even if it had been relevant, relief should be refused as a matter of discretion, because on the material before the Secretary of State there was no likelihood of it having led to a different decision.
Richards J accepted both submissions.
The second, which is not in dispute, is sufficient to support the decision in the case.
On the first, in view of the importance attached to his reasoning by the appellants, I will quote most of the relevant passage, at pp 142 143, in full: A decision maker will often be entitled, if not required, to take into account as a relevant or material consideration the financial consequences of his decision.
Consideration of the effects of a decision on others is a normal aspect of the decision making function and there is no difference of principle between financial effects and other effects.
The observations of Nicholls LJ, in Vasiliou v Secretary of State for Transport [1991] 2 All ER 77 as to the relevance of the adverse effects of a ministerial order were directed to the specific context of an order extinguishing or expropriating an individual's rights but are in my view capable of more general application.
Nor is the point limited to the effects of a decision on others.
It also applies to the financial consequences for the decision maker himself.
Where decisions involve the expenditure of public funds, the decision maker will normally be entitled or required to take into account matters such as the availability of funds and competing demands on those funds.
All that, however, is at a level of generality.
Whether a particular consideration is one that a decision maker is entitled or required to take into account in the exercise of a statutory power depends ultimately on the statute conferring that power.
A statute may restrict the range of permissible considerations either expressly or by implication.
Whether it does so is to be determined by reference to its provisions and to the statutory purpose.
In the exercise of their functions under sections 97 and 100 of the 1990 Act with regard to the revocation and modification of planning permissions, local planning authorities and the Secretary of State are required to have regard to ""material considerations"" (see section 97(2)).
What is capable of amounting to a material consideration for this purpose must in my view be the same as in relation to the initial determination of planning applications, i.e. the material considerations referred to in sections 70(2) and 54A.
Although the courts have adopted a flexible approach towards the concept, a consideration must in broad terms be a planning consideration in order to be material for that purpose.
Any consideration which relates to the use and development of land is capable of being a planning consideration (see Stringer v Minister of Housing and Local Government [1970] 1 WLR 1281, 1294).
It follows that financial consequences are capable of amounting to a material consideration in so far as they relate to the use and development of land.
R v Westminster City Council, Ex p Monahan [1990] 1 QB 87 is an example.
The need for a connection with the use and development of land was helpfully spelled out in the application of that decision in Northumberland County Council v Secretary of State for the Environment (1989) 59 P & CR 468.
It also follows, however, that in so far as financial consequences do not relate to the use and development of land, they are not capable of amounting to material considerations.
In my view that is fatal to the general proposition for which [leading counsel on behalf of the council] contends, that the cost to the local authority may be taken into account irrespective of land use consequences.
I see no warrant for treating cost as a permissible consideration even where it is not a material consideration within the meaning of the legislation.
It is wholly consonant with the statutory purpose that decisions under sections 97 and 100 should be guided only by planning considerations.
It cannot have been the legislative intention, in introducing provision for the payment of compensation, that the impact of such payment upon a local planning authority's financial position should condition the exercise of the powers to revoke or modify planning permissions.
Payment of compensation enters into the picture only after a decision to revoke or modify has been taken.
Its purpose is simply to ensure that persons interested in the land are compensated for any loss they suffer by reason of the revocation or modification of the permission. (Emphasis added)
It is to be noted that Richards J accepted as a general proposition that, where a decision involves the expenditure of public funds, the decision maker will normally be entitled or required to take into account matters such as the availability of funds and competing demands on those funds.
His reasoning for taking a different view in the present context depended (as seen in the emphasised passages) on three steps: i) The meaning of the term material considerations must be consistent throughout the Act, including as between section 70 and section 97. ii) The authorities show that financial considerations unrelated to the use and development of land are not material in relation to the grant or refusal of planning permission.
They cannot therefore be material in relation to the making of a revocation order. iii) Under the statutory scheme compensation enters the picture only after the order has been made.
I say at once that I find the third point very difficult to follow.
The fact that a restaurant bill normally arrives after the meal does not mean that the likely cost of the meal has to be ignored in deciding where and what to eat.
Similarly, potential liability to compensation cannot be said to be irrelevant merely because it is not fixed and payable at the outset.
I will return to the other points when considering the appellants arguments in this court.
It is necessary first to refer to the other main first instance authority, and the judgments of the Court of Appeal in the present case.
In R (Usk Valley Conservation Group) v Brecon Beacons National Park Authority [2010] 2 P & CR 198 (relating to a discontinuance order under section 102), Ouseley J disagreed with Richards Js interpretation.
He was willing to accept step (i) of the argument, that the term material considerations required a consistent interpretation, which limited it to planning considerations (para 202); but he thought that the concept of expediency implied a wider approach: 198.
An expedient decision would, to my mind, necessarily require attention to be paid to the advantages and disadvantages of taking one or other or none of the available steps under section 102.
These advantages and disadvantages should not be confined to those which the subject of the notice would face; they should be measured against the advantages and disadvantages to the public interest at large, including the costs and effectiveness of the various possibilities.
The question of whether the cost to the public is worth the gain to the public is, I would have thought, the obvious way of testing expediency.
At least, it is difficult to see that expediency could be tested without consideration of that factor.
In the Court of Appeal in the present case, Sullivan LJ thought that the introduction of the word expedient was not of itself sufficient to justify a different approach as between section 70 and section 97 (para 47).
He also accepted (para 46) that there must be a consistent approach to the meaning of material considerations in the enactments which comprise the planning code, a term which he treated as including the provisions both for the grant of permission (section 70), and those for revocation (section 97) and discontinuance (section 102) (para 45).
However, as I understand his reasoning, he saw the two expressions as working together.
First, he highlighted the different decision making process as between section 70 on the one hand, and sections 97 and 102 on the other.
The authority does not initiate the decision making process under section 70, and a decision to take no action is not an option: para 49.
By contrast, under section 97 or 102, the authority initiates the decision making process, and, having done so, may decide to take no action because it considers it not expedient to do so.
In that process it needs to consider the consequences under the Act, and whether action under some other provision would be more appropriate.
He continued: The 1990 Act must be read as a whole for the purpose of ascertaining Parliaments intention.
Since Parliament expressly provided that the local planning authorities will be liable to pay compensation if they decide that action should be taken under certain powers conferred by the Act, it must be inferred, in the absence of clear words to the contrary, that Parliament expected that a local planning authority would have regard to its liability to pay compensation under one part of the Act when deciding whether or not to exercise a power under another part of the Act.
A decision under section 97 is not taken in isolation, it is taken within the statutory framework of the 1990 Act.
If that statutory framework imposes a liability to pay compensation if a certain course of action is taken, there is no sensible reason why that liability should be ignored (in the absence of an express instruction to do so) when a decision is reached under the Act as to whether that action should be taken. (para 50)
Longmore LJ agreed with Sullivan LJ, partly because of the differences between section 70 and section 97, but also because he considered brightline rules to be much more troublesome in public law than in private law: The view that the fact and the amount of compensation can never be taken into account by a planning authority has, to my mind, an inappropriately absolute ring to it.
A private pocket may be required to pay up although the heavens fall around it, but such a principle can be awkward where the public purse is involved and public authorities have budgets within the limits of which they must, if possible, keep. (para 66)
He added that a planning authority would not be entitled to refuse to modify or revoke a planning permission by invoking a vague concept of cost to the public purse: They would have to say in terms what the amount of compensation is likely to be and precisely why it is expedient for that sum not to be paid in circumstances in which modification or revocation might otherwise be appropriate.
That is unlikely to be an easy or straightforward exercise. (para 67)
Pill LJ took a different view: I agree with Richards J in the Alnwick case that what is capable of amounting to a material consideration for the purposes of section 97 must be the same as in relation to the determination of planning applications under section 70.
Its use in a context in which compensation may follow from a decision does not affect what is comprehended by the term ""material considerations"", which are planning considerations related to the character, use or development of the land. (para 76)
He noted, but was unimpressed by, the argument (reflected in the judgment of Sullivan LJ at para 53) that, when the original version of section 102 was enacted in 1947, Parliament cannot have intended financial considerations to be ignored, since that would have led to a spate of expensive discontinuance orders to put right the legacy of numerous inappropriately sited uses and buildings: I do not accept that analysis.
The consistent theme in the legislation has been that planning decisions should be made in accordance with the development plan and any other material considerations.
The 1947 Act introduced the concept of the development plan which became the primary planning document for the local planning authority's area.
A good environment and development were to be achieved by means of a development plan, or a series of development plans.
It was not contemplated in 1947 that England (and Wales) would be transformed overnight into Blake's Jerusalem.
The route to progress was through the new development plans and not through extensive use of discontinuance orders. (para 87)
The introduction of the word expedient made no difference: The word expedient must be read in context: is it expedient having regard to the development plan and to any other material considerations? The word permits latitude in an evaluation but the evaluation must be based on matters lawfully taken into account, in my view considerations relating to the character, use or development of the land. (para 91)
From a practical point of view, he saw a risk that, if undue weight were given to financial considerations, the careful procedures normally followed to ensure that decisions inappropriate on planning grounds are not taken will operate less effectively, and a deterrent to facile decision making would be removed. (para 107)
The appellants arguments
Mr Coppel QC, for the HSE, has helpfully grouped his submissions under four main heads:
(1) Consistency
In his printed case, Mr Coppel went to some lengths to counter the various elements in Ouseley Js detailed reasoning in Usk.
However, the key points, and those most directly relevant to the majoritys reasoning in this case, can I think be summarised as follows: i) There is a presumption that words are used with a consistent meaning throughout a statute.
There is no good reason to depart from that presumption in this case. ii) The meaning of the phrase material considerations in the planning Acts is well established.
It does not include financial considerations, except where they have planning consequences. iii) Consistent with that principle, it is axiomatic that a planning permission cannot be bought and sold. iv) The majority were right to accept in principle that the expression material considerations should be given the same meaning throughout the planning code. v) They were wrong to hold in respect of section 97 that either the nature of the decision making process, or the inclusion of the concept of expediency, altered the range of factors to be taken into account.
That term gave the decision maker a wide latitude when evaluating the development plan and . other material considerations; but it did not widen the range of matters to which the authority could properly have regard when carrying out that evaluation.
(2) Effective judicial supervision
The majoritys interpretation would deprive the court of any effective power to control the exercise of the discretion under section 97.
The word expedient has been interpreted as giving the decision maker a wide latitude, which allows little room for intervention by the courts.
Further, the courts are reluctant to interfere with decisions involving allocation of limited resources, or to substitute their own views of relative priorities.
If material considerations include the financial impact on the authority, a case for revocation, however compelling on planning grounds, could lawfully be overridden by other demands on limited resources.
The authoritys functions under the planning Acts, including those relating to hazardous substances, should not capable of being traded against its other functions.
(3) Self interest
The corollary of the proposition that a planning permission cannot be bought or sold is that the decision to revoke or modify a permission cannot be devalued by consideration of its cost to the authority.
This lessens the independence of the local planning authority, and is alien to the integrity of the planning system.
The authority should not be tempted to deviate from the best planning decision by financial self interest.
(4) The importance of the development plan
Mr Coppel echoes Pill LJ (para 87) in emphasising the consistent theme of the legislation, that planning decisions should start from the development plan.
If material considerations extend to non planning considerations, the importance of the development plan is weakened, and its paramountcy cannot be secured against the wildcard of financial considerations (printed case, paragraph 78).
Discussion
In considering these arguments, and the reasoning of the courts below, I hope I will be forgiven for going back to the simple approach with which I started.
As I said then, and as Richards J accepted, general principles would normally dictate that a public authority should take into account the financial consequences for the public purse of its decisions.
I also said that, at least at first sight, I could find nothing in section 97 which requires it to be treated as an exception to those principles.
Nothing I have heard or read in this case has led me to change that view.
The principal argument to the opposite effect is the appeal to consistency.
I accept of course the ordinary presumption that Parliament is taken as using the same words in the same sense.
I am aware also that in planning law the apparently innocent expression material considerations has acquired an impressive overburden of case law going back more than 40 years.
However, none of the authorities before Alnwick were directed to the provisions related to revocation or discontinuance.
Sufficient consistency is given to the expression if the word material considerations is treated as it is elsewhere in administrative law: that is, as meaning considerations material (or relevant) to the exercise of the particular power, in its statutory context and for the purposes for which it was granted.
So read, the Court of Appeals interpretation creates no inconsistency between section 70 and section 97.
The meaning is the same, but the statutory context is different.
Under section 70 the planning authority has a duty to act, and it has a limited choice.
It must either grant or refuse permission.
Its decision must be governed by considerations material to that limited choice.
Further, the decision normally has no direct cost consequences for the authority (unless exceptionally it has a direct financial interest in the development, when other constraints come into play).
Under section 97, by contrast, the authority has no obligation to do anything at all; it has a discretion whether to act, and if so how.
Secondly, if it does decide to act, it must bear the financial consequences, in the form of compensation.
No doubt under section 70, planning permission cannot be bought or sold.
But section 97 creates a specific statutory power to buy back a permission previously granted.
Cost, or value for money, is naturally relevant to the purchasers consideration.
To speak of the self interest of the authority in this context is unhelpful.
A public authority has no self interest distinct from that of the public which it serves.
The same result can be achieved even on a narrower interpretation of the expression material considerations.
In other words, planning considerations, including the development plan, are the starting point.
Thus the primacy of the plan, if it has anything relevant to say on the issue, is not in doubt, but it may need to give way to other factors, including practicalities.
A decision to act under section 97 must be motivated by planning considerations, and directed to a planning objective.
But the converse does not follow.
Inaction is also an option.
In exercising its choice not to act under section 97, or in choosing between that and other means of achieving its planning objective, the authority is to be guided by what is expedient.
No principle of consistency requires that process to be confined to planning considerations, or to exclude cost.
This approach to the section does not exclude effective judicial supervision when necessary.
It is true that the word expedient normally implies a wide discretion reviewable only on conventional public law grounds.
However, as already noted, its scope in practice depends on the circumstances.
A public authority, faced with a serious threat to public safety within its sphere of responsibility, would find it difficult to defend the rationality of a refusal to act, if the only reason were other demands on its budget.
In any event, the Act contains its own remedy.
If the authority fails to act, the Secretary of State may be asked to make a revocation order (as happened in Alnwick), leaving the planning authority to pick up the bill.
I see no reason to doubt Richards Js actual conclusion in Alnwick.
On the facts and arguments as presented to the Secretary of State, it is difficult to see how his decision could have been different.
However, Richards J, with respect, took too narrow a view of the law.
Had there been more substantial evidence that the order would leave the authority in serious financial difficulties, I see no reason why the Secretary of State should have been obliged to leave it out of account, at least to the extent of considering whether a financial contribution might have been available from central or other sources.
Finally I should comment briefly on the point made at the end of Longmore LJs judgment.
I agree with his instinctive reaction against brightline rules governing the exercise of discretionary powers in public law.
I have more difficulty with his comment on the level of precision required to justify refusal to make an order.
Mr Coppel made a similar point, suggesting that authorities might find it difficult in practice to arrive at a clear estimate of the likely level of compensation, particularly in the absence of co operation from the landowner.
I do not see these as practical issues.
It is not possible in the abstract to say what kind of information, or what degree of precision, may be required by, or available to, the authority when making a decision of this kind.
It will depend on the circumstances.
That is neither unusual nor a cause for concern.
The same issues may arise, for example, whenever an authority is considering a major compulsory purchase project.
It will need at the planning stage to form a general view of the overall cost, including the cost of compensation, and of the resources available to meet it.
Initially, this view will need to be based largely on the advice and estimates of its expert advisers, the precision and certainty of which will depend on the timing and subject matter.
That uncertainty is not a reason for not conducting the exercise, still less for leaving cost considerations out of account altogether.
Conclusion
For these reasons, which essentially follow those of the majority of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.
","Wolverhampton City Council (the Council), in its capacity as the local planning authority, granted planning permission for four blocks of student accommodation in proximity to a site used for storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
Three of the four blocks of student accommodation had been completed, but work on the fourth had not commenced.
Concerned that the LPG storage facility in the vicinity constituted a danger to human life, the Health and Safety Executive (the HSE), a statutory, non departmental public body, applied for an order to revoke or modify the planning permission under section 97 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the Act).
In refusing the application, the Council took into account its liability to pay compensation under section 107 of the Act were it to revoke planning permission in respect of all four blocks, but it did not consider whether the application should be granted only in respect of the fourth block.
The HSE brought judicial review proceedings challenging, among other things, the Councils decision not to revoke or modify the planning permission.
The High Court refused that part of the claim.
The Court of Appeal allowed the HSEs appeal, holding that it was irrational for the Council to fail to consider whether to exercise its powers under section 97 so as to prevent the construction of the fourth block alone.
The Councils decision was therefore unlawful and it was ordered to reconsider the matter.
However, the Court of Appeal held by a majority (Pill LJ dissenting) that a decision under section 97 of the Act was to be taken not in isolation but within the statutory framework of the Act which imposed a liability to pay compensation if an order was made under the section.
Accordingly, the Council, when reconsidering the matter, would be entitled to take into account its liability to pay compensation under section 107 of the Act.
The HSE appealed to the Supreme Court against this part of the decision of the Court of Appeal: the issue being whether it is always open to a local planning authority, in considering under section 97 of the Act whether it appears to be expedient to revoke or modify a permission to develop land, to have regard to the compensation that it would or might have to pay under section 107.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the HSEs appeal.
Lord Carnwath gives the leading judgment of the Court with which all other Justices agree.
In simple terms, the question is whether a public authority, when deciding whether to exercise a discretionary power to achieve a public objective, is entitled to take into account the cost to the public of so doing.
As custodian of public funds, the authority not only may, but generally must, have regard to the cost to the public of its actions, at least to the extent of considering in any case whether the cost is proportionate to the aim to be achieved, and taking account of any more economic ways of achieving the same objective [24] [25].
Section 97 of the Act requires no different approach.
The section requires the authority to satisfy itself that revocation is expedient, and in so doing to have regard to the development plan and other material considerations.
The development plan throws no light on the issue in this case.
The word expedient implies no more than that the action should be appropriate in all the circumstances.
Where one of those circumstances is a potential liability for compensation, it is hard to see why it should be excluded.
Material in ordinary language is the same as relevant.
Where the exercise of the power, in the manner envisaged by the statute, will have both planning and financial consequences, there is no obvious reason to treat either as irrelevant [26].
Under section 97, a planning authority has a discretion whether to act, and, if so, how.
If it does decide to act, it must bear the financial consequences.
Section 97 creates a specific statutory power to buy back a permission previously granted.
Cost, or value for money, is naturally relevant to the purchasers consideration [51].
Sufficient consistency is given to the expression material considerations if it is treated as it is elsewhere in administrative law: that is, as meaning considerations material (or relevant) to the exercise of the particular power, in its statutory context and for the purposes for which it was granted.
So read, there is no inconsistency between section 97 and other sections such as section 70 [49] [50].
Furthermore, in exercising its choice not to act under section 97, or in choosing between that and other means of achieving its planning objective, the authority is to be guided by what is expedient.
No principle of consistency requires that process to be confined to planning considerations, or to exclude cost [52].
The contrary view of Richards J in Alnwick DC v Secretary of State (2000) 79 P & CR 130 was wrong, although the actual decision may be supportable on its own facts [54].
Possible difficulty in assessing precisely the likely level of compensation is no reason for not conducting the exercise, still less for leaving cost considerations out of account altogether [55] [56].
Accordingly, for reasons which essentially follow those of the majority of the Court of Appeal, the HSEs appeal is dismissed [57].
"
uksc-2018-0099,"This appeal concerns the permitted uses of a retail store in Streatham in the area of the London Borough of Lambeth (the Council).
Planning permission was originally granted by the Secretary of State in 1985, but the use was limited by condition to sale of DIY goods and other specified categories, not including food sales.
Following implementation, the permitted categories were extended by later consents (under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990), the most recent being in 2014 (the 2014 permission), which is in issue in this case.
The second respondent sought a certificate from the Council determining that the lawful use of the store extended to sales of unlimited categories of goods including food.
A certificate to that effect was refused by the Council, but granted by a planning inspector on appeal, and upheld by the lower courts.
The Council, as local planning authority, appeals to this court.
The planning history in more detail
The original permission, granted by the Secretary of State on 17 September 1985 (the 1985 permission), was subject to a number of conditions, including: 6.
The retail unit hereby permitted shall be used for the retailing of goods for DIY home and garden improvements and car maintenance, building materials and builders merchants goods and for no other purpose (including any other purpose in Class I of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1972 or in any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument revoking and re enacting that Order).
The exclusion of use for other purposes, including those within Use Class 1, had the effect of excluding (inter alia) food sales.
The following reason was given in the decision letter (para 16): Because the traffic generation and car parking requirements of certain types of large retail stores are substantially greater than those of the DIY unit proposed and could be excessive at this site, it is necessary to restrict the right to change to other
types of retail unit
On 30 June 2010, the Council granted a further planning permission (the 2010 permission) expressed to be for Variation of Condition 6 of the 1985 permission to allow for the sale of a wider range of goods as specified, not including food sales, and again excluding other uses within the relevant use class (now Class A1).
Although it is common ground that this permission was granted under section 73, there was no specific reference to that section in the document, which referred simply to the 1990 Act.
This permission included, as a separate condition 1, the same enumeration of permitted uses and exclusions as in the terms of the grant, and the following reason was given for the condition: In order to ensure that the level of traffic generation is such as to minimise danger, obstruction and inconvenience to users of the highway and of the accesses.
There were in addition two new conditions which had not been in the 1985 permission: 2.
Details of refuse and recycling storage to serve the development shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to first commencement of any of the additional retail uses hereby permitted.
The refuse and recycling storage facilities shall be provided in accordance with the approved details prior to commencement of the development and shall thereafter be retained as such for the duration of the permitted use. 3.
A strategy for the Management of Deliveries and Servicing shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to first commencement of any of the additional retail uses hereby permitted.
Deliveries and servicing shall thereafter be carried out solely in accordance with the approved details.
Reasons were given for each condition.
The permission now in issue was granted on 7 November 2014. (The application is not before us.) In this case the grant referred in terms to section 73.
It is necessary to set out the operative parts in full: DECISION NOTICE DETERMINATION OF APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 73 TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT 1990 The London Borough of Lambeth hereby approves the following application for the variation of condition as set out below under the above mentioned Act Development At: Homebase Ltd 100 Woodgate Drive, London SW16 5YP For: Variation of condition 1 (Retail Use) of Planning Permission Ref: 10/01143/FUL (Variation of Condition 6 (Permitted retail goods) of planning permission Ref 83/01916 Granted on 30.06.2010.
Original Wording: The retail use hereby permitted shall be used for the retailing of DIY home and garden improvements and car maintenance, building materials and builders merchants goods, carpets and floor coverings, furniture, furnishings, electrical goods, automobile products, camping equipment, cycles, pet and pet products, office supplies and for no other purpose (including the retail sale of food and drink or any other purpose in Class A1 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) or in any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument revoking and re enacting that Order).
Proposed Wording: The retail unit hereby permitted shall be used for the sale and display of non food goods only and, notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (or any Order revoking and re enacting that Order with or without modification), for no other goods. [I should note in passing that the reference in the revised form of condition to the General Development Order, rather than the Use Classes Order, appears to be a mistake, as Mr Lockhart Mummery QC for the third respondent suggested.
Neither he nor any of the parties saw it as significant to the issues in the appeal.] Approved Plans Summary of the Reasons for Granting Planning Permission: In deciding to grant planning permission, the Council has had regard to the relevant policies of the development plan and all other relevant material considerations.
Having weighed the merits of the proposals in the context of these issues, it is considered that planning permission should be granted subject to the conditions listed below.
Conditions 1.
The development to which this permission relates must be begun not later than the expiration of three years beginning from the date of this decision notice.
Reason: To comply with the provisions of section 91(1)(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 2.
Prior to the variation her[e]by approved being implemented a parking layout plan at scale of 1:50 indicating the location of the reserved staff car parking shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.
The use shall thereafter be carried out solely in accordance with the approved staff car parking details.
Reason: To ensure that the approved variation does not have a detrimental impact on the continuous safe an[d] smooth operation of the adjacent highway 3.
Within 12 months of implementation of the development hereby approved details of a traffic survey on the site and surrounding highway network shall be undertaken within one month of implementation of the approved development date and the results submitted to the local planning authority.
If the traffic generation of the site, as measured by the survey, is higher than that predicted in the Transport Assessment submitted with the original planning application the applicant shall, within three months, submit revised traffic modelling of the Woodgate Drive/Streatham Vale/Greyhound Lane junction for analysis.
If the junction modelling shows that junction capacity is worse than originally predicted within the Transport Assessment, appropriate mitigation measures shall be agreed with the council, if required, and implemented within three months of the date of agreement.
Reason: to ensure that the proposed development does not lead to an unacceptable traffic impact on the adjoining highway network There was no specific reference to conditions 2 and 3 of the 2010 permission.
On 10 June 2015, the second respondent applied to the Council for a certificate of lawfulness of proposed use or development (under section 192 of the 1990 Act) for unrestricted use of the store.
This was refused by the Council on 12 August 2015, but the appeal was allowed by the inspector by a decision letter dated 6 December 2016.
The letter gave a certificate of lawfulness for use described as The use of the premises for purposes within Use Class Al of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) without restriction on the goods that may be sold.
The reason given was: No condition was imposed on [the 2014 permission] to restrict the nature of the retail use to specific uses falling within Use Class A1
The statutory framework
It is unnecessary to set out the familiar provisions of the 1990 Act relating to the definition of development, and to the granting of planning permission.
It is to be noted however that the extension of the categories of goods to be sold within the store did not in itself amount to development (within the meaning of 1990 Act section 55) requiring planning permission.
The erection of the building and the commencement of sales under the 1985 permission no doubt involved both operational development and a material change of use.
Thereafter a change to sale of other categories (at least those within the relevant class under the current Use Class Order) would not involve any breach of planning control unless restricted by an appropriate condition.
Section 73 of the Act, on which the Council relied in granting the 2010 and 2014 permissions, is headed Determination of applications to develop land without compliance with conditions previously attached.
It provides: (1) This section applies to applications for planning permission for the development of land without complying with conditions subject to which a previous planning permission was granted. (2) On such an application the local planning authority shall consider only the question of the conditions subject to which planning permission should be granted, and (a) if they decide that planning permission should be granted subject to conditions differing from those subject to which the previous permission was granted, or that it should be granted unconditionally, they shall grant planning permission accordingly, and (b) if they decide that planning permission should be granted subject to the same conditions as those subject to which the previous permission was granted, they shall refuse the application.
The background to this section (formerly section 31A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971) was described by Sullivan J in Pye v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions [1998] 3 PLR 72: Prior to the enactment of (what is now) section 73, an applicant aggrieved by the imposition of the conditions had the right to appeal against the original planning permission, but such a course enabled the Local Planning Authority in making representations to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State when determining the appeal as though the application had been made to him in the first instance, to go back on the original decision to grant planning permission.
So the applicant might find that he had lost his planning permission altogether, even though his appeal had been confined to a complaint about a condition or conditions.
It was this problem which section 31A, now section 73, was intended to address .
While section 73 applications are commonly referred to as applications to amend the conditions attached to a planning permission, a decision under section 73(2) leaves the original planning permission intact and un amended.
That is so whether the decision is to grant planning permission unconditionally or subject to different conditions under paragraph (a), or to refuse the application under paragraph (b), because planning permission should be granted subject to the same conditions.
In the former case, the applicant may choose whether to implement the original planning permission or the new planning permission; in the latter case, he is still free to implement the original planning permission.
Thus, it is not possible to go back on the original planning permission under section 73.
It remains as a base line, whether the application under section 73 is approved or refused, in contrast to the position that previously obtained.
The original planning permission comprises not merely the description of the development in the operative part of the planning permission . but also the conditions subject to which the development was permitted to be carried out .
This passage was approved by the Court of Appeal in Powergen United Kingdom plc v Leicester City Council [2000] JPL 1037, para 28, per Schiemann LJ.
Sullivan Js comment that such applications are commonly referred to as applications to amend the conditions was echoed by Schiemann LJ, who noted, at para 1, that such an application is commonly referred to as an application to modify conditions imposed on a planning permission.
This usage is also consistent with the wording used in the statute under which section 31A was originally introduced.
It was one of various minor and consequential amendments introduced by section 49 and Schedule 11 of the Housing and Planning Act 1986, described as (d) applications to vary or revoke conditions attached to planning permission.
It is clear, however, that this usage, even if sanctioned by statute, is legally inaccurate.
A permission under section 73 can only take effect as an independent permission to carry out the same development as previously permitted, but subject to the new or amended conditions.
This was explained in the contemporary circular 19/86, para 13, to which Sullivan J referred.
It described the new section as enabling an applicant, in respect of an extant planning permission granted subject to conditions, to apply for relief from all or any of those conditions.
It added: If the authority do decide that some variation of conditions is acceptable, a new alternative permission will be created.
It is then open to the applicant to choose whether to implement the new permission or the one originally granted.
Although the section refers to development in the future, it is not in issue that a section 73 application can be made and permission granted retrospectively, that is in relation to development already carried out.
This question arose indirectly in the courts below, in the context of a dispute about the validity of the time limit condition (condition 1), which required the development to which this permission relates to be begun within three years.
The Court of Appeal upheld the inspectors decision that this condition was invalid, in circumstances where the relevant development had been carried out many years before.
Lewison LJ said: I cannot see that the decision notice granted planning permission for any prospective development.
The mere widening of the classes of goods that were permitted to be sold by retail does not amount to development at all.
Conformably with the definition of development in section 55 the only development to which the application could have related was the original erection of the store and the commencement of its use as a DIY store.
It was that development that was permitted subject to the conditions that the application was designed to modify; and it was the planning permission permitting that development to which the decision notice referred. (para 79)
I agree with that analysis, which is not I understand in dispute before this court.
However, it leaves open the question as to the effect of the new permission on conditions which have already taken effect following implementation of the earlier permission.
The section does not assist directly.
It envisages two situations: either (a) the grant of a new permission unconditionally or subject to revised conditions, or (b) refusal of permission, leaving the existing permission in place with its conditions unchanged.
It does not say what is to happen if the authority wishes to change some conditions but leave others in place.
As will be seen (para 20 below), the Court of Appeal cited government guidance indicating that to assist with clarity planning decisions under section 73 should also repeat the relevant conditions from the original planning permission.
However, as I read this, it was given as advice, rather than as a statement about the legal position.
Although the current status of the 2010 conditions is not directly in issue in the appeal, it is of some background relevance and has attracted conflicting submissions.
I shall return to this aspect later in the judgment.
For completeness, before leaving this discussion of section 73, I should note that circular 19/86 (referred to above) described its predecessor as complementing section 32 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 (later, section 63 of the 1990 Act), which at the time made specific provision for retrospective permissions (Permission to retain buildings or works or continue use of land).
That section has since been repealed and partially replaced by section 73A of the 1990 Act (see Planning and Compensation Act 1991, Schedule 7).
Whatever the precise significance of this change, it is not suggested that it has any relevance to the issues in this appeal and neither side has sought to rely on section 73A.
Principles of interpretation
We have received extensive submissions and citations from recent judgments of this court on the correct approach to interpretation.
Most relevant in that context is Trump International Golf Club Ltd v Scottish Ministers [2015] UKSC 74; [2016] 1 WLR 85.
An issue in that case related to the interpretation of a condition in a statutory authorisation for an offshore wind farm, requiring the developer to submit a detailed design statement for approval by Ministers.
One question was whether the condition should be read as subject to an implied term that the development would be constructed in accordance with the design so approved.
In the leading judgment Lord Hodge (at paras 33 37) spoke of the modern tendency in the law to break down divisions in the interpretation of different kinds of document, private or public, and to look for more general rules.
He summarised the correct approach to the interpretation of such a condition: 34.
When the court is concerned with the interpretation of words in a condition in a public document such as a section 36 consent, it asks itself what a reasonable reader would understand the words to mean when reading the condition in the context of the other conditions and of the consent as a whole.
This is an objective exercise in which the court will have regard to the natural and ordinary meaning of the relevant words, the overall purpose of the consent, any other conditions which cast light on the purpose of the relevant words, and common sense.
He rejected a submission that implication had no place in this context: 32. [Counsel] submits that the court should follow the approach which Sullivan J adopted to planning conditions in Sevenoaks District Council v First Secretary of State [2005] 1 P & CR 186 and hold that there is no room for implying into condition 14 a further obligation that the developer must construct the development in accordance with the design statement.
In agreement with Lord Carnwath JSC, I am not persuaded that there is a complete bar on implying terms into the conditions in planning permissions 35.
While the court will, understandably, exercise great restraint in implying terms into public documents which have criminal sanctions, I see no principled reason for excluding implication altogether.
In the instant case, had it been necessary to do so, he would, at para 37, have readily drawn the inference that the conditions of the consent read as a whole required the developer to conform to the design statement in the construction of the windfarm.
In my own concurring judgment, having reviewed certain judgments in the lower courts which had sought to lay down lists of principles for the interpretation of planning conditions, I commented: I see dangers in an approach which may lead to the impression that there is a special set of rules applying to planning conditions, as compared to other legal documents, or that the process is one of great complexity. (para 53) Later in the same judgment, I added: Any such document of course must be interpreted in its particular legal and factual context.
One aspect of that context is that a planning permission is a public document which may be relied on by parties unrelated to those originally involved It must also be borne in mind that planning conditions may be used to support criminal proceedings.
Those are good reasons for a relatively cautious approach, for example in the well established rules limiting the categories of documents which may be used in interpreting a planning permission But such considerations arise from the legal framework within which planning permissions are granted.
They do not require the adoption of a completely different approach to their interpretation. (para 66)
In summary, whatever the legal character of the document in question, the starting point and usually the end point is to find the natural and ordinary meaning of the words there used, viewed in their particular context (statutory or otherwise) and in the light of common sense.
The Court of Appeals reasoning
It is unnecessary to review in any detail the reasoning of the inspector or the High Court, since the issues, and the competing arguments, are fully discussed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal.
Having set out the planning history and the terms of section 73, Lewison LJ (paras 19 22) identified what he saw as the problem.
While he acknowledged that it was clear what Lambeth meant to do in a very broad sense, he said: But that is not the question.
The question is: what did Lambeth in fact do? The application was an application for the variation of a condition attached to the 2010 permission the technical trap, into which it is said that Lambeth fell, is that approval of an application under section 73 requires the grant of a fresh planning permission, rather than merely a variation of an existing one It follows from this that the decision notice must be read as a free standing grant of planning permission.
However, it failed to repeat any of the conditions imposed on the previous planning permissions and, more importantly, failed to express the new description of the use as a condition, rather than as a limited description of the permitted use He noted the advice given in the relevant Planning Policy Guidance note (PPG): It should be noted that the original planning permission will continue to exist whatever the outcome of the application under section 73.
To assist with clarity, decision notices for the grant of planning permission under section 73 should also repeat the relevant conditions from the original planning permission, unless they have already been discharged.
This advice, he thought, was reflective of the words of section 73(2)(a) which requires a local planning authority, if it decides that different conditions should be imposed, to grant planning permission accordingly: that is to say in accordance with the conditions upon which it has decided that planning permission should be granted.
Later in the judgment he addressed the submissions before the court.
He noted that Mr Reed QC for the Council put his argument in two ways: first by implication of a condition and second as a matter of interpretation.
He thought it more logical to reverse the order, while accepting that the exercise was an iterative process, and observing that the objective was not to determine what the parties meant to do in the broad sense, but what a reasonable reader would understand by the language they in fact used. (para 38)
Having referred to the findings of the judge in the court below, he summarised Mr Reeds submission on the interpretation of the decision notice: 45.
In the light of those findings Mr Reed argues that the decision notice described itself as doing no more than approving a variation of condition in two previous planning permissions.
For technical reasons, however, a variation of a condition under section 73 takes effect as the grant of a fresh planning permission.
In order to give effect to Lambeths intention and also to that of the applicant for the variation of the condition, the limited description of the use must therefore be read as if it were itself a condition.
In the critical paragraphs of the judgment, he gave his view of how the
reasonable reader would have approached the matter: 52.
The reasonable reader of the decision notice must be notionally equipped with some knowledge of planning law and practice.
The distinction between a limited description of a permitted use and a condition is a well known distinction.
The reasonable reader would also know that the Governments own guidance stated that any conditions applicable to planning permission granted under section 73 must be explicitly stated.
He would know the general structure of a planning permission which will set out a summary of the application, describe the development permitted by the permission and, in a separate part of the permission, will set out any conditions imposed on the grant of planning permission with reasons for those conditions.
He would notice that there were some conditions attached to the grant which were explicitly stated in the decision notice, and that the decision notice stated that Lambeth had decided that planning permission should be granted subject to the conditions listed below.
If he had looked back over the planning history he would also have seen the 2010 approval of a variation to the condition, which did specify the permitted range of goods in the form of a condition.
That had not been repeated in the decision notice.
He would also have noticed that the decision notice in 2010 had imposed two conditions (relating to refuse and recycling on the one hand, and management of deliveries on the other) which had also not been repeated in the decision notice.
If he had considered the 2013 refusal he would have seen that Lambeth was not satisfied at that time that the applicant had demonstrated that increased traffic would not lead to adverse impacts.
But he would have seen that the decision notice of 2014 referred to a traffic assessment which Lambeth had considered.
He would also have noticed that condition 3 required a traffic survey and the implementation of mitigation measures if junction capacity was worse than predicted.
He might reasonably have concluded that Lambeth had been sufficiently satisfied on this second application to grant conditional permission, with the safety net of condition 3. 53.
Accordingly, sympathetic though I am to Lambeths position, this submission seems to me to go well beyond interpretation.
It is not a question of rearranging words that appear on the face of the instrument (as in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] AC 1101).
It is a question of adding a whole condition, which has a completely different legal effect to the words that Lambeth in fact used.
As a further point he noted the statutory requirement for the notice to state the reasons for any condition imposed.
He said: To impose a condition without giving reasons for it would be a breach of statutory duty.
It is one of the principles of contractual interpretation that one should prefer a lawful interpretation to an unlawful one.
There is nothing in the decision notice which could amount to a clear, precise and full reason for treating the description of the use as a condition.
Although Mr Reed suggested that the first reason given for the 2013 refusal could stand as the reason, I consider that to be untenable.
The requirement to give reasons is applicable to the notice.
It may be that the notice might extend to another document incorporated by reference; but that is not this case.
Although the decision notice does cross refer both to the original planning permission and also to previous approved variations, it does not mention the refusal at all.
There would be no reason for a reasonable reader of the decision notice to suppose that a reason for an unexpressed condition was contained in a document which was simply part of the background. (para 59)
Lewison LJ went on to deal with the alternative formulation, based on implication of a condition in the same form as the proposed wording, holding that it failed to meet the stringent tests laid down by the authorities (paras 63 75).
In particular he accepted a submission by Mr Lockhart Mummery that the judgments in Trump (like the decision on which they relied: Crisp from the Fens Ltd v Rutland County Council (1949 1951) 1 P & CR 48) decided no more than that implication might be made into an extant condition that was incomplete; they did not contemplate the implication of a wholly new condition (para 72).
In this court Mr Reed QC for the Council repeated and developed his arguments in the Court of Appeal.
In line with the decision of the High Court in Im Your Man Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment [1998] 4 PLR 107, he did not seek to argue that the proposed wording could be treated as an enforceable limitation.
He accepted the need to establish that the permission was subject to a legally effective condition in that form.
In summary he put his case in three ways: (a) as a matter of the correct interpretation of the permission; (b) by correction of an obvious error (by analogy with the contractual principles applied in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38; [2009] 1 AC 1101); (c) by the implication of a condition in the terms of the proposed wording (applying the principles in Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd [2009] UKPC 10; [2009] 1 WLR 1988).
The respondents generally adopted the reasoning of the Court of Appeal.
Mr Kolinsky QC for the Secretary of State emphasised the need for clarity and certainty in a public document.
For the third respondent (as freehold owner of the site), Mr Lockhart Mummery reminded us that planning is a creature of statute, in which common law principles have a limited role; and also of the need for clear and specific words to exclude rights granted by provisions such as the Use Classes Order.
Commentary
With respect to the careful reasoning of the courts below, I consider that an ordinary reading of the decision notice compels a different view.
I find it unnecessary to examine in detail the more ambitious alternatives proposed by Mr Reed.
However, I observe in passing (in agreement with Mr Lockhart Mummerys submission as to the limited scope of the judgments in Trump) that it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would be appropriate to use implication for the purpose of supplying a wholly new condition, as opposed to interpretation of an existing condition.
On the issue of interpretation, Lewison LJ was of course right to say that the 2014 permission needs to be seen through the eyes of the reasonable reader.
However, such a reader should be assumed to start by taking the document at face value, before being driven to the somewhat elaborate process of legal and contextual analysis hypothesised in Lewison LJs para 52.
In essence Mr Reeds submission, in the simple form recorded by Lewison LJ at para 45 (para 22 above) was in my view correct.
It is not necessarily assisted by the varying formulations and citations discussed in his submissions to this court.
There is a risk of over complication.
Taken at face value the wording of the operative part of the grant seems to me clear and unambiguous.
The Council hereby approves an application for the variation of condition as set out below .
There then follow precise and accurate descriptions of the relevant development, of the condition to be varied, and of the permission under which it was imposed.
They are followed by statements first of the Original wording, and then of the Proposed wording; the latter stating in terms that the store is to be used for the sale of non food goods only and for no other goods.
Proposed wording in this context must be read as a description of the form of condition proposed in the application and hereby approved.
In other words, the obvious, and indeed to my mind the only natural, interpretation of those parts of the document is that the Council was approving what was applied for: that is, the variation of one condition from the original wording to the proposed wording, in effect substituting one for the other.
There is certainly nothing to indicate an intention to discharge the condition altogether, or in particular to remove the restriction on sale of other than non food goods.
The suggested difficulties of interpretation do not arise from any ambiguity in the terms of the grant itself.
Nor do they raise any question about the extent to which it is permissible to take account of extraneous material.
It is unnecessary to look beyond the terms of the document.
In these respects the case differs from many of the authorities to which reference has been made in submissions.
The arguments against this simple view turn, not on any lack of clarity in the grant itself, but on supposed inconsistencies, firstly with its statutory context, and secondly with the treatment of other conditions in the remainder of the document.
In respect of the statutory context, the objection is that this reading is inconsistent with the scope of the power under which the grant was made.
Section 73, referred to in terms in the permission, does not give the authority power simply to vary a condition in the previous permission.
That purpose could only be achieved by the grant of a new permission, subject in terms to a condition in the revised form.
Accordingly, it is said, it was not enough simply to approve the proposed wording, without its terms being incorporated into the form of condition as required by section 73(2)(a).
One problem with this argument is that it goes too far for the respondents case.
If section 73 gave no power to grant a permission in the form described, the logical consequence would be that there was no valid grant at all, not that there was a valid grant free from the proposed condition.
The validity of the grant might perhaps have been subject to a timely challenge by an interested third party or even the Council itself.
That not having been done, there is no issue now as to the validity of the grant as such.
All parties are agreed that there was a valid permission for something.
That being the common position before the court, the document must be taken as it is.
It may be that insufficient attention was paid in the submissions below to the background of section 73, as discussed earlier in this judgment.
Once it is understood that it has been normal and accepted usage to describe section 73 as conferring power to vary or amend a condition, the reasonable reader would in my view be unlikely to see any difficulty in giving effect to that usage in the manner authorised by the section that is, as the grant of a new permission subject to the condition as varied.
If the document had stopped at that point, I do not think such a reader could have been left in any real doubt about its intended meaning and effect.
The lack of a specific reason for the condition, to which Lewison LJ attached weight, is of little practical significance, given that this was the relaxation of a previous condition for which the reason was well known, rather than the imposition of a new restriction.
In any event the absence of a reason would not affect the validity of the condition (see Brayhead (Ascot) Ltd v Berkshire County Council [1964] 2 QB 303).
Turning to the second part of the notice, it is true that there are some internal inconsistencies.
Its heading suggests that it is simply stating the reasons for the permission granted in the first part, rather than imposing a separate set of conditions.
Further, the wording of the conditions themselves betrays some ambivalence about what has been approved.
In some places it is referred to as the development to which this permission relates, or the proposed development, in others as the variation hereby approved or the approved variation. (As I have already noted, the time limit condition was held by the courts below to be wholly invalid.)
However, reading the document as a whole, and taking the first part in the sense suggested above, the second part can be given a sensible meaning without undue distortion.
It is explanatory of and supplementary to the first part.
The permitted development incorporating the amended condition is regarded as acceptable, in accordance with the development plan, but only subject to the conditions set out.
They are in other words additional conditions.
They are designed to regulate the expanded use as permitted by the revised condition, dealing in particular with staff parking, and monitoring of the additional traffic impact.
The other 2010 conditions
As I have said, we are not directly concerned in this appeal with the status of the other conditions in the 2010 permission, so far as still potentially relevant, notably conditions 2 and 3 relating respectively to treatment of waste and management of deliveries.
However, some comment may be desirable, since the issue was subject to conflicting submissions before the Court of Appeal and in this court.
At first sight it would seem surprising if the council, when relaxing the restrictions on sales, had not intended to maintain such requirements.
No reason was given for releasing them, and it does not appear to have been requested in the application.
For the Council, Mr Reeds position seems to have shifted during the course of the appeal below.
Lewison LJ (paras 46 47) recorded his initial submission that conditions 2 and 3 should be treated as incorporated into the new permission; the reasonable reader of the decision notice could not be taken to understand that Lambeth was abandoning them.
However, this argument was not pursued in his oral submissions (judgment paras 48, 51), and he seems implicitly to have accepted that they would cease to be effective.
In this court this issue was not dealt with in any detail in the written submissions.
Questioned in argument, Mr Lockhart Mummery QC for the third respondent submitted that conditions 2 and 3, not having been repeated in the new permission, must be taken as having lapsed altogether.
In reply Mr Reed for the Council took a rather different position to that initially taken in the Court of Appeal.
His submission as I understood it was that the 2010 conditions, so far as still relevant, were not as such incorporated into the new permission; but they continued to have effect under the 2010 permission, so far as not inconsistent with anything in the new grant.
Although we have not heard full argument, my provisional view is that Mr Reeds current submission is correct.
It will always be a matter of construction whether a later permission on the same piece of land is compatible with the continued effect of the earlier permissions (see the principles discussed in Pioneer Aggregates (UK) Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment [1985] AC 132, 144).
In this case, following implementation of the 2010 permission, the conditions would in principle remain binding unless and until discharged by performance or further grant.
Conditions 2 and 3 were expressed to remain operative during continuation of the use so permitted.
The 2014 permission did not in terms authorise non compliance with those conditions, nor, it seems, did it contain anything inconsistent with their continued operation.
Accordingly, they would remain valid and binding not because they were incorporated by implication in the new permission, but because there was nothing in the new permission to affect their continued operation.
This approach to the interpretation of the decision notice seems to me consistent with the decision of Sullivan J in a case relied on by Mr Reed before the Court of Appeal: Reid v Secretary of State for Transport [2002] EWHC 2174 (Admin).
Permission for a transport depot had been granted subject to 12 conditions.
The landowner applied for development described as retention of the use of the land without compliance with condition 2 (improvements to public highway) .
The local authority responded with a notice referring to the terms of the application, and expressed in these terms notice of its decision to APPROVE Planning Permission for the application set out above subject to the following conditions: Conditions None.
Sullivan J held that the grant did not mean that the other conditions were no longer effective.
He said: 58.
There is an apparent conflict between the description of the proposed development, which refers not to an existing use but to the retention of a permitted use without compliance with one condition in the 1992 planning permission, and the words Conditions: None.
One is left wondering what is to happen to the remaining conditions on the 1992 planning permission.
Once it is accepted that both the application and the 1992 planning permission referred to in the application for permission may properly be considered for the purpose of construing the meaning of the 2002 permission, then the words Conditions: None mean, in that context, no additional conditions beyond those which had been imposed upon the 1992 permission.
Lewison LJ saw this as a case turning on the particular wording of permission, which was held to have the effect that the conditions attached to the previous planning permission continued to apply to the new one.
He saw it as of no assistance in the present case, particularly given Mr Reeds abandonment before the Court of Appeal of the argument that the conditions attached to the 2010 permission could be carried forward into the new permission (para 51).
As I read the judgment, however, Sullivan J did not intend to say that the other 11 conditions were by implication to be treated as included in the new permission, or that the old permission was superseded.
Rather the new permission, confined as it was to the retention of the use without complying with condition 2, and involving no inconsistency with the old permission and the remaining conditions, had no effect on their continuing effect as conditions subject to which the development had been carried out.
The words Conditions: None was indicating that there were to be no additional conditions beyond those already having effect under the earlier permission.
By contrast, in the present case, the specific conditions in the 2014 permission were intended to be additional both to the varied condition, and to the others remaining in effect under the 2010 permission.
Sullivan J added the following comment: 59.
I accept unreservedly that the drafting of the 2002 planning permission could have been much clearer.
The inspectors observations as to good practice should be heeded by all local planning authorities.
When issuing a fresh planning permission under section 73, it is highly desirable that all the conditions to which the new planning permission will be subject should be restated in the new permission and not left to a process of cross referencing.
Good practice was not followed in the present case.
The present case illustrates the wisdom of that advice, which is also reflected in the PPG.
Nothing in the present judgment is intended to detract from that advice, nor from the importance of ensuring that applications and grants under section 73 are couched in terms which properly reflect the nature of the statutory power.
Conclusions
For these reasons I would allow the appeal.
The precise wording of the order should be agreed between the parties, or subject to further submissions.
","This appeal concerns the permitted uses of a retail store in Streatham in the London Borough of Lambeth.
Planning permission was granted by the Secretary of State in 1985, but the use was limited by condition to sale of DIY goods and other specified categories, not including food.
The permitted categories were extended by later consents (under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the 1990 Act)).
The most recent was in 2014, which is in issue in this case.
In that permission, the proposed new wording for the permission included: The conditions in the 2014 permission did not refer to the restriction on the sale of food goods, or to conditions in the previous permission from 2010.
The second respondent (Aberdeen Asset Management) sought a certificate from the appellant Council determining that the lawful use of the store extended to sales of unlimited categories of goods including food.
A certificate to that effect was refused by the Council, but granted by a planning inspector on appeal, on the basis that no condition was imposed on the 2014 permission to restrict the nature of the retail use to specific uses.
This was upheld by the lower courts.
The Council, as the local planning authority, appeals to this court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
The certificate should be amended to exclude uses within the scope of the Proposed wording in the decision notice.
Lord Carnwath gives the lead judgment.
Section 73 of the 1990 Act envisages two situations: either (a) the grant of a new permission unconditionally or subject to revised conditions, or (b) refusal of permission, leaving the existing permission in place with its conditions unchanged.
It does not say what is to happen if the authority wishes to change some conditions but leave others in place.
Government guidance indicating that to assist with clarity planning decisions under section 73 should also repeat the relevant conditions
from the original planning permission was given as advice, rather than as a statement about the legal position [13].
Whatever the legal character of the document in question, the starting point for interpretation is to find the natural and ordinary meaning of the words there used, viewed in their particular context and in the light of common sense [19].
The 2014 permission needs to be seen through the eyes of a reasonable reader, who is assumed to start by taking the document at face value [28].
The wording of the operative part of the grant are clear and unambiguous.
The Council approves an application for the variation of condition as set out below, which is followed by precise and accurate descriptions of the relevant development, of the condition to be varied, and of the permission under which it was imposed.
That is followed by statements of the Original wording, then of the Proposed wording, the latter stating in terms that the store is to be used for the sale of non food goods only.
The obvious and only natural interpretation of those parts of the document is that the Council was approving what was applied for: the variation of one condition from the original wording to the proposed wording, in effect substituting one for the other.
There is nothing to indicate an intention to discharge the condition altogether, or to remove the restriction on the sale of food goods [29].
If section 73 gave no power to grant a permission in the form described, the logical consequence would be that there was no valid grant at all, not that there was a valid grant free from the proposed condition.
There is no issue now as to the validity of the grant as such, and all parties agree there was a valid permission for something.
That being the common position, the document must be taken as it is [32].
It has been normal and accepted usage to describe section 73 as conferring power to vary or amend a condition, so the reasonable reader would not see any difficulty in giving effect to the 2014 permission in the manner authorised by the section i.e. as the grant of a new permission subject to the condition as varied.
The absence of a reason for the condition does not affect its validity [33].
There are some internal inconsistencies in the second part of the notice, but reading the document as a whole, the second part can be given a sensible meaning without undue distortion.
It is explanatory of and supplementary to the first part.
The permitted development incorporating the amended condition is acceptable but only subject to the other conditions set out.
In other words, they are additional conditions [34 35].
This appeal is not concerned with the status of the conditions in the 2010 permission, but the courts provisional view is that the 2010 conditions were not incorporated into the new permission, but continued to have effect under the 2010 permission, so far as they are consistent with anything in the new grant.
The conditions remain valid and binding because there was nothing in the new permission to affect their continued operation [37 38].
Nothing in the present judgment is intended to detract from the advice, contained in the decision by Sullivan J in R (Reid) v Secretary of State for Transport [2002] EWHC 2174 (Admin), at paragraph 59, that it is highly desirable that all the conditions to which the new planning permission will be subject should be restated in the new permission and not left to a process of cross referencing [42].
"
uksc-2011-0244,"The issue on this appeal is whether and if so in what circumstances the Financial Services Authority (FSA) should, as a condition of obtaining a freezing injunction under section 380(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and/or section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (SCA), be required to give to the court a cross undertaking in damages in favour of third parties affected by the injunction.
The answer I would give is that there is no general rule that an authority like the FSA acting pursuant to a public duty should be required to give such an undertaking, and that there are no particular circumstances why it should be required to do so in the present case.
The issue has been argued as a matter of principle between the FSA and Barclays Bank plc (Barclays), a potentially affected third party.
However, a brief statement of the background is appropriate.
On 20th December 2010 proceedings were commenced by the FSA against three defendants (Sinaloa Gold plc, a person or persons trading as PH Capital Invest and a Mr Glen Lawrence Hoover) on the basis that (a) Sinaloa was promoting the sales of shares without being authorised to do so and without an approved prospectus, contrary to FSMA sections 21 and 85, (b) PH Capital Invest and Mr Hoover were knowingly engaged in this activity, and (c) PH Capital Invest was as an unauthorised person carrying on regulated activities in breach of FSMA section 19 in various other respects.
which Mr Hoover was the sole authorised signatory.
Before issuing these proceedings, the FSA had on 17th December 2010 obtained without notice an injunction freezing the defendants assets under sections 380(3) FSMA and/or 37(1) SCA.
Barclays were notified of the order on 20th December 2010, and the injunction was continued by David Richards J at a hearing on notice on 31st December 2010.
Sinaloa Gold plc had six bank accounts at Barclays, in respect of all of
As originally issued, Schedule B to the injunction, headed Undertakings given to the Court by the Applicant, read: (1) The Applicant does not offer a cross undertaking in damages. (4) The Applicant will pay the reasonable costs of anyone other than the Respondents which have been incurred as a result of this order including the costs of finding out whether that person holds any of the Respondent's assets and if the court later finds that this order has caused such person loss, and decides that such person should be compensated for that loss, the Applicant will comply with any order the court may make. (italics added) By the time the injunction was continued, the possible inconsistency between paragraphs (1) and (4) was observed, and the FSA was required to agree to add at the end of paragraph (1) the phrase save to the extent provided in paragraph (4) below, without prejudice to its right to apply to vary paragraph (4).
On 12th January 2011 the FSA applied to have the words which I have italicised in paragraph (4) removed.
Barclays intervened to oppose the application, which was refused by HHJ David Hodge QC on 25th January 2011 [2011] EWHC 144(Ch).
On 18th October 2011 the Court of Appeal reversed his decision and ordered a cross undertaking in the terms of paragraph (4) without the italicised words [2012] Bus LR 753.
The effect was to preserve the undertaking in respect of costs incurred by third parties (which the FSA did not dispute), but to eliminate any requirement that the FSA give an undertaking in respect of losses incurred by third parties.
Barclays now appeals by permission of this Court.
The FSA and FSMA
The FSA is governed by FSMA.
Schedule 1 to FSMA makes provision about its status, including an exemption from liability in damages (paragraph 12 below).
The FSA was given general functions which in discharging it must, so far as is reasonably possible, act in a way which is compatible with defined regulatory objectives and which it considers most appropriate for the purpose of meeting those objectives: FSMA, section 2(1) and (4).
Its general functions include making rules, preparing and issuing codes, giving general guidance and determining general policy and principles by reference to which to perform particular functions.
The regulatory objectives include maintaining market confidence in the UK financial system (section 3), protecting and enhancing the stability of the UK financial system (section 3A, as inserted by section 1(3) of the Financial Services Act 2010), securing the appropriate degree of protection for consumers (section 5) and reducing the extent to which it is possible for a business carried on by a regulated person or in contravention of the general prohibition to be used for a purpose connected with financial crime (section 6).
Section 19 in Part II of FSMA prohibits any person from carrying on, or
purporting to carry on, a regulated activity in the UK unless authorised (under sections 40 to 43 in Part IV) or exempt.
This is the general prohibition, for contravention of which penalties are set by section 23.
Section 21 contains specific restrictions on financial promotion, including communicating an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity in the course of business, with penalties for contravention being set by section 25.
Section 85 prohibits dealing in transferable securities without an approved prospectus.
Section 380(3) provides that, if, on the application of the FSA or the Secretary of State, the court is satisfied that any person may have contravened, or been knowingly concerned in the contravention of, a relevant requirement it may make an order restraining him from disposing of, or otherwise dealing with, any assets of his which it is satisfied he is reasonably likely to dispose of or otherwise deal with.
A relevant requirement includes a requirement which is imposed by or under this Act (section 380(6)(a)) and so includes the requirement under section 19 to be authorised or exempt before carrying on a regulated activity.
Under Part IV of FSMA, permission may be given subject to such requirements as the FSA thinks appropriate (section 43), which may include an assets requirement prohibiting the disposal of, or other dealing with, any of the permitted persons (As) assets or their transfer to a trustee approved by the FSA (section 48(3)).
Under section 45(4), the FSA may on its own initiative vary a previously included Part IV permission to include an assets requirement.
Under section 48(4) and (5), if the FSA imposes an assets requirement and gives notice to any institution with which a person (A) keeps an account, the notice has the effect that (a) the institution does not act in breach of any contract with A in refusing any instruction from A in the reasonably held belief that complying would be incompatible with the requirement and (b) if the institution complies with the instruction, it is liable to pay to the FSA an amount equal to that transferred from or paid out of As account.
In relation to authorised persons, the FSA thus enjoys a right to impose a freezing order without going to court and without any occasion arising on which a cross undertaking could be required of it.
The FSA also enjoys an exemption from liability in damages, set out in paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 to FSMA: (1) Neither the Authority nor any person who is, or is acting as, a member, officer or member of staff of the Authority is to be liable in damages for anything done or omitted in the discharge, or purported discharge, of the Authority's functions. (2) Neither the investigator appointed under paragraph 7 nor a person appointed to conduct an investigation on his behalf under paragraph 8(8) is to be liable in damages for anything done or omitted in the discharge, or purported discharge, of his functions in relation to the investigation of a complaint. (3) Neither sub paragraph (1) nor sub paragraph (2) applies (a) if the act or omission is shown to have been in bad faith; or (b) so as to prevent an award of damages made in respect of an act or omission on the ground that the act or omission was unlawful as a result of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.
Paragraph 19(1) of Schedule 1 would protect the FSA, if it was, for example, the subject of a claim by A on whom it had imposed an assets requirement under section 45(4), by an institution to which it had notified the imposition of such a requirement under sections 48(4) and (5) or by any other third person.
Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Schedule 1 require the FSA to establish a scheme for the independent investigation of complaints against it (other than complaints more appropriately dealt with in another way, e.g. by referral to the Upper Tribunal under the appeals procedure contained in Part IX of FSMA or by the institution of other legal proceedings), and the issue and, where appropriate, publication of reports on such complaints.
The present issue
The issue now before the Supreme Court raises for consideration: (a) whether and how far the position of the FSA, seeking an interim injunction pursuant to its public law function and duty, is to be equated with that of a person seeking such an injunction in pursuance of private interests; (b) whether and how far the position regarding the giving of any cross undertaking differs according to whether it is to protect a defendant or a third party; and (c) whether there is any coherent distinction between cross undertakings in respect of third party losses and costs.
Taking the first point, I propose to start with the requirements which apply when a claimant is pursuing private interests.
Since the first half of the 19th century such claimants have when seeking an interim injunction been required to give the usual undertaking.
That means an undertaking to abide by any order this Court may make as to damages in case the Court shall hereafter be of opinion that the Defendants . shall have sustained any by reason of this order which the [claimant] ought to pay: see e.g. Tucker v New Brunswick Trading Company of London (1890) 44 Ch D 249, 251.
The practice regarding defendants is reflected in CPR 1998, Practice Direction (PD) 25A 5.1(1), requiring, unless the court orders otherwise, an undertaking to pay any damages which the respondent sustains which the court considers the applicant should pay.
But modern practice, reflected in PD 25A 5.1A, also provides that, when the court orders an injunction it should consider whether to require an undertaking by the applicant to pay any damages sustained by a person other than the respondent, including another party to the proceedings or any other person who may suffer loss as a consequence of the order.
Asset freezing (formerly Mareva) injunctions were developed by the courts in the late 1970s and 1980s.
Because of their particular, potentially stringent effects, they are separately regulated in the rules.
PD 25A 6 annexes a sample wording which may be modified in any particular case.
In addition to an undertaking in the usual form in favour of the defendant, it includes an undertaking in favour of third persons in identical form to paragraph (4) of that originally required in this case (paragraph 6 above).
The history of the undertaking in favour of third persons can be traced back to a statement by Lord Denning MR in Prince Abdul Rahman Bin Turki Al Sudairy v Abu Taha [1980] 1 WLR 1268, 1273 and to decisions by Robert Goff J in Searose Ltd v Seatrain UK Ltd [1981] 1 WLR 894 and Clipper Maritime Co Ltd of Monrovia v Mineralimportexport [1981] 1 WLR 1262.
In Searose, Robert Goff J, building on Lord Dennings statement, held that, where a bank had to incur costs in identifying whether a bank account existed within the terms of a Mareva injunction, it should be entitled to an undertaking to cover its reasonable costs, before it incurred them.
In Clipper Maritime the freezing injunction obtained by the claimants covered cargo or bunkers belonging to the defendants Mineralimportexport on board a vessel which was on time charter to Mineralimportexport and which was in the port of Barry.
Its effect might have been to inhibit the port authority in its use of the port and to cause it loss of income.
An undertaking was required to cover any actual income lost to the port authority.
In the later case of Galaxia Maritime SA v Mineralimportexport [1982] 1 WLR 539, the defendants were again Mineralimportexport and a freezing injunction was initially granted to prevent them from removing from the jurisdiction (just before Christmas) a cargo on a third partys vessel which was only on voyage charter to Mineralimportexport.
The Court of Appeal categorically refused to continue the interim injunction on any terms, since it could effectively block the third partys vessel indefinitely.
Under the standard forms of injunction currently in use for both ordinary interim injunctions and freezing injunctions, the enforcement of the undertaking is expressed to be in the courts discretion.
There is little authority in this area.
Neill LJ undertook a useful review of the general principles in Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society v Ricketts [1993] 1 WLR 1545, 1551D 1552D.
The position regarding undertakings in favour of defendants has been more recently reviewed in Commercial Injunctions, by Steven Gee QC, 5th ed (2004 and First Supplement), paragraphs 11.017 11.032, while the authorities on undertakings in favour of third parties are covered in paragraphs 11.008 11.012.
An inquiry into damages will ordinarily be ordered where a freezing injunction is shown to have been wrongly granted, even though the claimant was not at fault: paragraph 11.023.
But, depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate for the court to await the final outcome of the trial before deciding whether to enforce: see the Cheltenham and Gloucester case, p.1552B.
However, Professor Adrian Zuckerman has pointed out (The Undertaking in Damages Substantive and Procedural Dimensions [1994] CLJ 546, 562) that it does not follow from a defendants success on liability that he did not in fact remove (or seek to remove) assets from the reach of the claimant, justifying an interim freezing order.
The court retains a discretion not to enforce the undertaking if the defendants conduct makes it inequitable to enforce: F Hoffmann La Roche & Co AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295, 361E, per Lord Diplock.
It seems likely that compensation is assessed on a similar basis to that upon which damages are awarded for breach of contract: Cheltenham and Gloucester, p.1552C D, per Neill LJ.
The position regarding third persons is necessarily different in certain respects.
The purpose of the cross undertaking is to protect them so long at least as they are innocent third persons not implicated in the alleged wrongdoing or conduct justifying the freezing order whether or not the freezing order was justified as against the defendant.
That purpose goes back to the orders first made in the Searose and Clipper Maritime cases.
I turn to the position of an authority acting in pursuit of public functions.
The leading authority is the Hoffmann La Roche case.
Following a report by the Monopolies Commission the Department of Trade and Industry made an order under the relevant monopolies legislation: the Regulation of Prices (Tranquilising Drugs) (no. 3) Order 1973 (SI 1973 No 720), setting maximum prices for certain drugs.
Hoffmann La Roche issued proceedings claiming that the Monopolies Commission report had been unfair and contrary to natural justice and was invalid, and that the Regulations based upon it were likewise ultra vires and invalid.
The Department issued proceedings, and sought an injunction to restrain Hoffmann La Roche from charging prices in excess of the Order prices under a provision in the primary legislation (section 11 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act 1948) which provided that compliance with any such order shall be enforceable by civil proceedings by the Crown for an injunction or for any other appropriate relief.
The issue argued was whether the Department should be required to give a cross undertaking in damages in order to obtain the order.
The House recognised the general rule requiring a cross undertaking as a condition of the grant of an interim injunction in ordinary litigation: see e.g. per Lord Reid at p 341B.
It recognised that, since the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, there was no continuing justification for the former blanket practice whereby the Crown was not required to give any such undertaking in any circumstances (even in cases where it was asserting proprietary or contractual rights which a private person could have and enforce): per Lord Reid at p 341C and Lord Diplock at p 362B H.
But it considered, by a majority, that the Crown remains in a position different from that of any private individual when it brings what Lord Diplock described as a law enforcement action: p 363B.
The majority did not express itself with one voice regarding the implications of this distinction.
Lord Reid thought special circumstances or special reason to be required before the Crown should have to expose itself by cross undertaking: p 341E and G. Lord Cross of Chelsea however accepted that it might be fair to require that the Crown give a cross undertaking where the defendants defence was that what he is doing or proposing to do was not prohibited by the order in question, but that, where as here the defence was that what was on the face of it the law of the land was not in fact the law, exceptional circumstances would be required before the court should countenance the possibility that the Crown might be deterred from applying for an interim injunction by the need to give a cross undertaking: p 371D G. Lord Morris of Borth y Gest also focused on the apparent unlawfulness of the sales in excess of the order prices which Hoffmann La Roche was threatening.
Lord Diplock saw no reason, since the Crown Proceedings Act, for a rigid rule that the Crown itself should never be required to give the usual undertaking in damages in a law enforcement action, but equally no basis for the converse proposition that the court . ought always to require an undertaking: p 364C D: this was because (p 364E): When . a statute provides that compliance with its provisions shall be enforceable by civil proceedings by the Crown for an injunction, and particularly if this is the only method of enforcement for which it provides, the Crown does owe a duty to the public at large to initiate proceedings to secure that the law is not flouted .
Lord Diplock continued (p 364F G): I agree therefore with all your Lordships that the practice of exacting an undertaking in damages from the Crown as a condition of the grant of an interlocutory injunction in this type of law enforcement action ought not to be applied as a matter of course, as it should be in actions between subject and subject, in relator actions, and in actions by the Crown to enforce or to protect its proprietary or contractual rights.
On the contrary, the propriety of requiring such an undertaking from the Crown should be considered in the light of the particular circumstances of the case.
In concluding that no cross undertaking should be required, Lord Diplock repeated that the Crown was seeking to enforce the law by the only means available under the governing statute, and he, like Lord Morris and Lord Cross, stressed that Hoffmann La Roche was threatening to breach an apparently valid order approved by each House of Parliament: pp 364H 365B.
On this basis, he also said (p 367A C): So in this type of law enforcement action if the only defence is an attack on the validity of the statutory instrument sought to be enforced the ordinary position of the parties as respects the grant of interim injunctions is reversed.
The duty of the Crown to see that the law declared by the statutory instrument is obeyed is not suspended by the commencement of proceedings in which the validity of the instrument is challenged.
Prima facie the Crown is entitled as of right to an interim injunction to enforce obedience to it.
To displace this right or to fetter it by the imposition of conditions it is for the defendant to show a strong prima facie case that the statutory instrument is ultra vires.
However, he went on (p 367C D): Even where a strong prima facie case of invalidity has been shown upon the application for an interim injunction it may still be inappropriate for the court to impose as a condition of the grant of the injunction a requirement that the Crown should enter into the usual undertaking as to damages.
For if the undertaking falls to be implemented, the cost of implementing it will be met from public funds raised by taxation and the interests of members of the public who are not parties to the action may be affected by it.
Lord Wilberforce, dissenting in Hoffmann La Roche, was unenthusiastic about English laws unwillingness to accept that a subject should be indemnified for loss sustained by invalid administrative action (p 359A), but rested his dissent ultimately on the fact that, without a cross undertaking, the Crown in Hoffmann La Roche would be put in a position where, if it ultimately lost the action, the injunction would have enabled it (through the National Health Service) to profit during the period while the injunction precluded Hoffmann La Roche from selling to the National Health Service at market, rather than order prices.
Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council v Wickes Building Supplies Ltd [1993] AC 227 was another case concerned with a claim to enforce apparently valid legislation, this time by a local authority and relating to Sunday trading.
Lord Goff of Chieveley at p 274C D read the speeches in Hoffmann La Roche as dismantling an old Crown privilege and substituting for it a principle upon which, in certain limited circumstances, the court has a discretion whether or not to require an undertaking in damages from the Crown as law enforcer.
In extending the principle to all public authorities, he said (p 274D E): The principle appears to be related not to the Crown as such but to [T]he the Crown when performing a particular function. considerations which persuaded this House to hold that there was a discretion whether or not to require an undertaking in damages from the Crown in a law enforcement action are equally applicable to cases in which some other public authority is charged with the enforcement of the law: see e.g. Lord Reid, at p. 341G, Lord Morris of Borth y Gest, at p. 352C, and Lord Cross of Chelsea, at p. 371B G.
In In re Highfield Commodities Ltd [1985] 1 WLR 149 Sir Robert Megarry V C interpreted Hoffmann La Roche as deciding that no cross undertaking should be required of the Crown unless the defendant showed special circumstances justifying the requirement.
In Attorney General v Wright [1988] 1 WLR 164 Hoffmann J regarded as undeniable (even if, to some eyes, not particularly attractive) the potency of the principle that Crown officials should not be inhibited from performing their duty to take action to enforce the law by the fear that public funds may be exposed to claims for compensation by people who have thereby caused [sic] loss (p 166C D).
On the facts, however, he required an undertaking to be given by the receiver of, and to be met out of the funds of, the charity for whose benefit the Attorney General was suing to recover property.
Although the Attorney General was not suing to protect any proprietary or contractual right of the Crown, he was suing in the proprietary interests of the charity, which could be expected to give an undertaking.
In Director General of Fair Trading v Tobyward Ltd [1989] 1 WLR 517, Hoffmann J said that, whatever one might say about the policy, it is well established that the usual practice is that no cross undertaking is required when the Crown is seeking an interim injunction to enforce the law (p 524E H).
In Securities and Investments Board v Lloyd Wright [1993] 4 All ER 210, Morritt J addressed the issues on the basis of defence counsels concession that it would not be appropriate that there should be a cross undertaking of damages in a law enforcement action (p 213H J), and in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Anchor Foods Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 1139 at p 1152C D, Neuberger J said that it would ordinarily not be right to require a cross undertaking in damages from Customs, but ordered one because of the unusual facts of this case, in which Customs was, to protect its right to VAT, seeking to halt a sale of business at an independent valuation to a new company.
Finally, the Court of Appeal in United States Securities and Exchange Commission v Manterfield [2009] EWCA Civ 27, [2009] Lloyds Rep FC 203 applied the line of authority including Kirklees, In re Highfield and Lloyd Wright when endorsing the exercise of the judges discretion to dispense with the giving of a cross undertaking by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Commission was seeking a freezing order in aid of Massachusetts proceedings brought in the interest of investors generally to recover assets obtained by Manterfield in the course of a fraudulent investment scheme involving the sale of limited partnership interests in an unregistered fund.
Presenting the present appeal for Barclays, Mr Richard Handyside QC did not mount a direct attack on Hoffmann La Roche itself.
Rather he submitted that it was distinguishable because it concerned enforcement of an apparently valid executive order in relation to which the only defence was that the order was invalid, and that the later authorities referred to in the preceding paragraph had read it too broadly.
Mr Handyside did however also refer to Professor Zuckermanns article, which was avowedly critical of the decision in Hoffmann Roche.
Professor Zuckermanns reasons included Lord Wilberforces, and he also argued that a cross undertaking can encourage greater care before interfering with a citizens liberty.
He questioned the weight placed in Hoffmann La Roche on the presumption of validity of the relevant law.
Mr Handyside submits that the same criticism applies, a fortiori, to the weight placed by Hoffmann J on the apparent strength of the complaint of misleading advertising on which the injunction was based in Tobyward.
There is considerable general force in this particular criticism of Hoffmann La Roche.
The purpose of a cross undertaking in favour of a defendant is to cover the possibility of loss in the event that the grant of an injunction proves to have been inappropriate.
To refuse to require a cross undertaking because it appears, however strongly, unlikely ever to be capable of being invoked misses the point.
The remoteness of the possibility of loss might indeed be thought to be a reason why the public authority would be unlikely to be inhibited from seeking injunctive relief by fear that public funds may be exposed to claims for compensation.
I note that, although Lord Diplock attached some significance to the strength of the Crowns case in Hoffmann La Roche, he did not confine his comments on the difference between private litigation and law enforcement action to cases where the Crowns case was founded on apparently well founded legislation; on the contrary: see paragraph 24 above.
In any event, however, this particular criticism does not impinge on the general distinction drawn in Hoffmann La Roche and subsequent cases between private litigation and public law enforcement action.
In private litigation, a claimant acts in its own interests and has a choice whether to commit its assets and energies to doing so.
If it seeks interim relief which may, if unjustified, cause loss or expense to the defendant, it is usually fair to require the claimant to be ready to accept responsibility for the loss or expense.
Particularly in the commercial context in which freezing orders commonly originate, a claimant should be prepared to back its own interests with its own assets against the event that it obtains unjustifiably an injunction which harms anothers interests.
Different considerations arise in relation to law enforcement action, where a public authority is seeking to enforce the law in the interests of the public generally, often in pursuance of a public duty to do so, and enjoys only the resources which have been assigned to it for its functions.
Other than in cases of misfeasance in public office, which require malice, and cases of breach of the Convention rights within section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, it remains the case that English law does not confer a general remedy for loss suffered by administrative law action.
That is so, even though it involves breach of a public law duty.
In the present context, the fact that an injunction is discharged, or that the court concludes after hearing extended argument that it ought not in the first place to have been granted, by no means signifies that there was any breach of duty on the public authoritys part in seeking it.
As I have said, Mr Handyside does not take issue with this general distinction, and the appeal has been argued accordingly.
Mr Handyside does, however, take issue with the way in which Hoffmann La Roche has been interpreted as indicating that public authority claims to interim injunctions should be approached.
Hoffmann la Roche has been understood at first instance as involving a usual or normal rule that a cross undertaking will not be required from the Crown.
Mr Handyside submits that this understanding goes further than justified.
In Hoffmann La Roche, only Lord Reid spoke of a general rule according to which special circumstances or reason must exist before a cross undertaking should be required from the Crown.
Lord Morris was silent.
But Lord Diplock said that the practice of exacting an undertaking ought not to be applied as a matter of course and should, on the contrary. be considered in the light of the particular circumstances of the case.
This was a more neutral formulation, but still indicates a need to identify particular circumstances before a cross undertaking is required.
Lord Morris and Lord Cross focused on the particular circumstance that the only defence involved a challenge to the validity of an apparently valid order.
However, I do not regard that as a satisfactory demarcation of any distinction between public and private claims: paragraph 29 above.
For reasons indicated in paragraph 31 above, there is in my view a more general distinction between public and private claims.
Ultimately, there is a choice.
Either the risk that public authorities might be deterred or burdened in the pursuit of claims in the public interest is accepted as a material consideration, or authorities acting in the public interest must be expected generally to back their legal actions with the public funds with which they are entrusted to undertake their functions.
That latter approach could not be adopted without departing from Hoffmann La Roche, and Hoffmann La Roche draws a distinction between public and private claims which depends upon accepting the former approach.
Hoffmann La Roche stands at least for the proposition that public authority claims brought in the public interest require separate consideration.
Consistently with the speeches of Lord Reid and Lord Diplock (and probably also of Lord Cross), it indicates that no cross undertaking should be exacted as a matter of course, or without considering what is fair in the particular circumstances of the particular case.
A starting point along these lines does not appear to me to differ significantly from the practice subsequently adopted at first instance: see paragraph 27 above.
I accept its general appropriateness.
Mr Handyside further submitted that, in whatever sense Hoffmann La Roche is understood, it concerned only the protection of defendants.
The present appeal concerns the protection of third persons, who, unless the contrary is shown, are to be taken as having no involvement in the breach of the law alleged against the defendants.
The present appeal certainly proceeds on the basis that Barclays had no such involvement.
However, the distinction which Mr Handyside suggests does not in my opinion hold good.
Speaking generally, a cross undertaking in relation to a defendant protects against the event that no injunction should have been granted, either when it was granted or in the light of the defendants ultimate success at trial.
While it is possible to conceive of a case in which an injunction was wrongly granted on the material then available, but the defendant is at trial found to have breached the law, it is unlikely that the cross undertaking would then be enforced.
A cross undertaking in relation to third persons protects against the event that an innocent third person, without involvement in whatever breach of the law is alleged against the defendant, suffers loss or expense through the grant of the injunction, whether this should or should not have occurred.
In either case, therefore, it is loss caused by the grant of an injunction in circumstances where the person incurring the loss is essentially innocent that is covered by the cross undertaking.
Finally, Mr Handyside submits that no sensible distinction can exist between a cross undertaking in respect of costs, which the FSA has accepted that Barclays should receive (paragraphs 6 and 7 above), and the cross undertaking in damages, which is at issue on this appeal.
The FSA has, he submits, in effect, undermined its own case by conceding the former.
This is not convincing.
First, the appeal raises an issue of general principle, which cannot be resolved by a concession in a particular case.
Second, there is to my mind a pragmatic basis for a distinction between specific costs and general loss.
The rationale of Hoffmann La Roche, that public authorities should be able to enforce the law without being inhibited by the fear of cross claims and of exposing financially the resources allocated by the state for their functions, apply with particular force to any open ended cross undertaking in respect of third party loss.
It does not apply in the same way to a cross undertaking in respect of third party expense.
Even in a private law context, this distinction may sometimes be relevant to bear in mind.
So Neuberger J thought in Miller Brewing Co v Mersey Docks & Harbour Co [2004] FSR 5, 81 paragraphs 44 45 (paragraphs not touched by criticism levelled at the actual decision in Mr Gees work on Commercial Injunctions, paragraph 11.015, into which it is unnecessary to go).
The present case
The present case resembles Hoffmann La Roche, Kirklees, Tobyward and Lloyd Wright.
It is a case of a public authority seeking to enforce the law by the only means available under the governing statute.
The FSA was acting under its express power to seek injunctive relief conferred by section 380(3).
It was acting in fulfilment of its public duties in sections 3 to 6 of FSMA to protect the interests of the UKs financial system, to protect consumers and to reduce the extent to which it was possible for a business being carried on in contravention of the general prohibition being used for a purpose connected with financial crime.
I therefore approach this appeal on the basis that there is no general rule that the FSA should be required to give a cross undertaking, in respect of loss suffered either by the defendants or by third parties.
It is necessary to consider the circumstances to determine whether a cross undertaking should be required in this particular case.
The circumstances include some further background considerations.
First, there is no general duty in English public law to indemnify those affected by action undertaken under legislative authority.
Innocent third parties may be affected in situations ranging from the Victorian example of trains run on an authorised railway line (Hammersmith and City Railway Company v Brand (1869) LR 4 HL 171) to the erection of a barrier on a pavement (Dormer v Newcastle upon Tyne Corp [1940] 2 KB 204) to police closure of a street following an incident.
Secondly, if one focuses attention on acts for which fault might be alleged to attach to the FSA, the FSA will be liable in the unlikely event of a misfeasance in public office or in the event that its conduct amounts to a breach of the Human Rights Act Convention rights.
But there is no basis in FSMA for treating the FSA as having a wider statutory or common law responsibility even to innocent third parties.
Thus, thirdly, if the FSA were to fail to take appropriate steps to shut down unlawfully conducted activity, innocent third persons might suffer loss, but they could have no claim against the FSA.
Fourthly, even in a case of positive action taken by the FSA affecting innocent third persons, the general protective duties and objectives of FSMA could not involve under FSMA or at common law any assumption of responsibility towards or any liability for breach of a duty of care enforceable at the instance of third persons: see e.g. Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council [2004] UKHL 15, [2004] 1 WLR 1057, Jain v Trent Strategic Health Authority [2009] UKHL 4, [2009] 1 AC 853 and Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc [2006] UKHL 28, [2007] 1 AC 181.
Paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 to FSMA in any event provides expressly that they do not.
The present appeal concerns the fourth situation, in that the FSA was taking positive action to shut down what it alleged to be unlawful activity.
An interim injunction obtained in such a situation may cause innocent third persons loss.
They clearly could not complain about loss arising from an unlawful scheme being closed down.
But, if the scheme proved after all to be lawful, they might be seen to have sustained loss which they should not in a perfect world have suffered.
However, the FSA has powers under Part IV of FSMA allowing it without any application to the court to freeze the assets of an authorised person, in a way which could equally cause loss to innocent third persons.
If the exercise of a Part IV freezing power should subsequently transpire to have been inappropriate, no basis exists upon which such third persons could claim to be indemnified in respect of such loss.
Indeed paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 to FSMA would again clearly exclude the FSA from any risk of liability: see paragraph 12 above.
There would be an apparent imbalance, if the FSA were required to accept potential liability under a cross undertaking when it addresses the activities of unauthorised persons and has therefore to seek the courts endorsement of its stance in order for a freezing order to issue.
The Respondent sought also to gain assistance from paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 to FSMA.
A cross undertaking is colloquially described as being in damages, and liability under it is measured on ordinary damages principles.
But it is clear that it does not involve a liability for damages in a conventional legal sense.
The cross undertaking is to the court.
Liability under it, when the court in its discretion determines that the cross undertaking should be enforced, is in a sum assessed by the court, albeit using similar principles to those by which it measures damages.
Accordingly, it is common ground that paragraph 19 cannot directly apply to prevent the FSA from being required to give, or from enforcement of, a cross undertaking.
On the other hand, as the Court was told without contradiction, the enactment of paragraph 19 was not based and did not follow upon any consideration of the possibility that the FSA might be required to give a cross undertaking before being granted an injunction under section 380(3).
That possibility was, so far as appears, not in the legislators mind, one way or the other.
In Lloyd Wright (paragraph 27 above), Morritt J considered in a context paralleling the present a predecessor to paragraph 19 which existed in the form of section 187(3) of the Financial Services Act 1986.
He rejected a submission of the Securities and Investment Board that this prevented the court from requiring a cross undertaking.
But he went on (p 214h): Rather, it seems to me to be a clear pointer in the exercise of the discretion, which the court undoubtedly has, to indicate that no such cross undertaking should be required where the designated agency is, in fact, seeking to discharge functions exercisable pursuant to a delegation under the 1986 Act.
It seems to me that that is a matter which, in the exercise of my discretion, I should take into account in concluding that no cross undertaking should be required.
It is unnecessary on this appeal to express any view on the correctness of treating paragraph 19 as a clear pointer in a context where that paragraph cannot ex hypothesi apply.
In the light of the factors identified in paragraphs 36 to 38, there is on any view no reason to move away from the starting position, which is that the FSA should not have to give any cross undertaking in order to obtain an injunction under section 380(3).
HHJ Hodge QC considered that such a cross undertaking in favour of innocent third parties should be required as a matter of course, from the moment when any freezing order was first granted on an ex parte basis (para 66).
The Court of Appeal was in my view right to disagree and substituted for the undertaking as originally given an undertaking in the limited form (i.e. excluding the italicised words) indicated in paragraphs 6 and 7 above.
I would therefore dismiss this appeal.
Further observations
A further word is appropriate regarding the positions at the initial stage, where injunctive relief is sought on an ex parte (or without notice) basis, and at the later stage, when the matter comes before the court on notice to both parties as well perhaps as to third persons, such as Barclays.
Normally, there would only be a very short period before an on notice hearing could occur, and normally one would expect any third person affected by an injunction to become aware of this risk, even if not given formal notice of the injunction by the FSA.
Loss could in theory be sustained by either a defendant or a third person in that short period.
But any cross undertaking required as a condition of the grant of interim injunctive relief on a without notice basis would have to be in general and unqualified terms, and therefore be of the kind which could cause most concern to a regulator worried about risk and resource implications.
The present appeal concerns the position of the FSA at the without notice and on notice stages.
The starting position at each stage should in my view be that no cross undertaking should be required unless circumstances appear which justify a different position.
Any inhibition on the part of a public authority about giving an undertaking is likely to be greater, rather than less, at a without notice stage.
To require a blanket undertaking in favour of third parties at that stage would provide no incentive to third parties to come forward and identify any real concerns that they might have.
The better approach is in my view to regard the starting position, that no cross undertaking should be required, as being as applicable at the without notice stage as it is at the on notice stage.
A defendant or a third party who is or fears being adversely affected by an injunction obtained under section 380(3) can and should be expected to come forward, to explain the loss feared and to apply for any continuation of the injunction to be made conditional on such cross undertaking, if any, as the court may conclude should in all fairness be required to meet this situation.
Finally, whenever the court is considering whether to order an interim injunction without any cross undertaking, it should bear in mind that this will mean that the defendant or an innocent third party may as a result suffer loss which will be uncompensated, even though the injunction later proves to have been unjustified.
This consideration was rightly identified by Neuberger J in Miller Brewing at paragraph 40.
Conclusion
For the reasons given in paragraphs 1 to 41, I would dismiss this appeal.
","On 20 December 2010, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), acting in pursuance of its public duties under sections 3 to 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), made a without notice application for a freezing injunction against Sinaloa Gold and PH Capital Invest under section 380(3) of FSMA.
The FSA alleged that both companies were involved in promoting the sale of shares in Sinaloa without proper authorisation and an approved prospectus and that PH Capital Invest had breached FSMA in various other respects.
Schedule B to the injunction stated that the FSA gave no cross undertaking in damages.
However, under Schedule B, the FSA undertook to cover both costs and losses incurred by third parties as a result of the injunction.
The undertaking in respect of third party losses was inadvertent and the FSA applied to have it removed.
Barclays with whom Sinaloa Gold plc had six bank accounts intervened to oppose this application.
The application to have the undertaking removed was refused in the High Court.
However, this decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal.
The effect of the Court of Appeals decision was to preserve the undertaking in respect of third party costs but eliminate the undertaking in respect of third party losses.
Barclays appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
There is no general rule that an authority such as the FSA, acting pursuant to a public law duty, should be required to give a cross undertaking in respect of losses incurred by third parties.
Further, there are no particular circumstances which mean that the FSA should be required to give such a cross undertaking on the facts of this case.
The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Mance.
Whilst there is no continuing justification for the former blanket practice whereby the Crown was not required to give a cross undertaking in any circumstances, a general distinction still exists between private claims and law enforcement actions [33].
In a private claim, a claimant seeking an injunction will ordinarily be expected to give a cross undertaking in damages to the defendant(s) and to third parties.
This can be justified on the basis that such a claimant should be prepared to back its own interest with its own assets against the event that it obtains the injunction unjustifiably with the result that harm is caused to the interest of another [30].
However, different considerations arise in relation to law enforcement actions, where a public authority is seeking to enforce the law in the interests of the public generally, often in pursuance of a public duty to do so, and enjoys only the resources which have been assigned to it for its functions [31].
In these circumstances public authorities cannot generally be expected to back their legal actions with the public funds with which they are entrusted for the purpose of undertaking their functions [33].
Such a requirement may inhibit public officials from fulfilling their public duties for fear of exposing public funds to claims for compensation.
The position regarding the giving of any cross undertaking cannot differ according to whether it is intended to protect a defendant or a third party [14, 34].
In both instances the cross undertaking covers the loss caused by the grant of an injunction in circumstances where the person incurring the loss is essentially innocent [34].
A pragmatic distinction can be drawn between an undertaking in respect of costs and an undertaking in damages.
Public authorities should be able to enforce the law without being inhibited by the fear of cross claims and the exposure of their resources, and this applies with particular force to any open ended undertaking in respect of third party loss.
It does not apply with the same force to a more limited cross undertaking in respect of third party costs [35].
There are no special circumstances why the FSA should be required to give a cross undertaking in respect of losses suffered by third parties on the particular facts of this case.
In a case such as the instant one, where the FSA takes positive action to shut down allegedly unlawful activity, it does not in the course of so doing assume any responsibility towards or liability for breach of a duty of care enforceable at the instance of third parties [37 38].
The FSA enjoys a further power to freeze the assets of a permitted person, without making any application to a court, under Part IV of the FSMA.
In the exercise of its powers under Part IV the FSA is excluded from any risk of liability by virtue of paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 to FSMA.
There would therefore be an apparent imbalance were the FSA required to accept potential liability in cases such as the instant one concerned with the activities of unauthorised persons [37 38].
"
uksc-2010-0039,"This appeal raises a question as to the scope of the exceptions to the principle that statements made in the course of without prejudice negotiations are not admissible in evidence (the without prejudice rule).
Specifically, the question is whether facts which (a) are communicated between the parties in the course of without prejudice negotiations and (b) would, but for the without prejudice rule, be admissible as part of the factual matrix or surrounding circumstances as an aid to construction of an agreement which results from the negotiations, should be admissible by way of exception to the without prejudice rule.
The dispute between the parties relates to a series of forward freight agreements (FFAs) and is set against the background of the extraordinary volatility of the freight markets in 2008.
Capesize bulk carriers are large vessels, so called because they were historically too large to pass through the Suez Canal.
The Baltic Exchange index of daily rates of time charter hire for such vessels fell from about US$200,000 per day in May 2008 to US$3,000 per day in December 2008.
Each FFA was a swap agreement which consisted of a bet on whether the settlement rate (being the average of the published rates, as stated in the relevant index, for each index publication day in the relevant settlement month) would, on specified future settlement dates, be higher or lower than the contract rate as defined in the FFA.
Under each FFA the seller bet that the market rate on the settlement dates would be lower than the contract rate and the buyer bet that it would be higher.
If it was higher on a given settlement day, the seller was obliged to pay the difference between the two rates multiplied by the contract period, which was usually the number of days in the month.
If it was lower the buyer was obliged to pay the seller the appropriate amount.
The relevant FFAs had settlement days at the end of one or more months within the period May to December 2008.
At the end of each month all settlement sums due under all the FFAs were to be netted off and payment made by the indebted party under the net position to the other party. (I use the word bet because it was used by the parties in the agreed statement of facts and issues and because it appears to me to be accurate, but in doing so I do not intend to suggest that the FFAs were unenforceable or that FFAs are not a commonly used method of hedging against market fluctuations.)
All the FFAs were on the same underlying terms.
As at the end of May 2008 the appellants, whom I will together call TMT, were short against the market and, as a result of the netting off process, owed the respondent (Oceanbulk) more than US$40m for that month and were likely to owe a further US$30m for the following month.
If Oceanbulk had terminated the FFAs on the basis of an event of default, TMT would have been potentially liable for some US$300 to 400m by way of liquidated damages.
TMT failed to pay the May 2008 instalment when it fell due and sought time for payment.
The parties entered into settlement negotiations which were expressed to be without prejudice.
They were between the parties representatives and solicitors.
The negotiations were partly in writing but included two lengthy meetings on 19 and 20 June 2008 which were attended both by the parties representatives and their solicitors.
The parties entered into a written settlement agreement dated 20 June, in which they agreed (among other things): (a) to crystallise 50 per cent of each of the FFAs for 2008 based on the difference between the contract rate and the average of the ten day closing prices for the relevant Baltic indices from 26 June 2008; and (b) to co operate to close out the 50 per cent balance of the open 2008 FFAs against the market on the best terms achievable by 15 August 2008.
There is no issue between the parties as to the existence or terms of the settlement agreement.
It is common ground that all the terms of the agreement between them are accurately recorded in the written settlement agreement.
For that reason neither party seeks rectification of it.
There is however a dispute between the parties as to the true construction of one of the terms of the agreement.
The issue which divides the parties in this appeal is whether it is permissible to refer to anything written or said in the course of the without prejudice negotiations as an aid to the interpretation of the agreement.
The issues
Construction of the settlement agreement
Oceanbulks claim is based on the alleged breach by TMT of clause 5 of the agreement, which provides as follows: In respect of FFA open contracts between TMT interests and [Oceanbulk] for 2008, the parties shall crystallise within the ten trading days following 26 June 2008, as between them, 50 per cent of those FFAs at the average of the ten days closing prices for the relevant Baltic Indices from 26 June 2008 and will co operate to close out the balance of 50 per cent of the open FFAs for 2008 against the market on the best terms achievable by 15 August 2008.
The parties crystallised 50 per cent of the contracts within ten days following 26 June.
There is accordingly no dispute about that part of the clause.
However, Oceanbulk says that TMT is in breach of the second part of the clause (the co operation term) on the basis that, so it is said, TMT did not co operate to close out the balance of 50 per cent of the open FFAs for 2008 against the market on the best terms achievable by 15 August.
By way of damages Oceanbulk claims the difference between the sums it says would have been owed by TMT had the FFAs been closed out by 15 August, when the market was still in Oceanbulks favour, and the amount that is said to be due to TMT under the FFAs as a result of those positions having remained open.
The loss arises (in part at least) out of the dramatic fall in the market to which I have referred.
Oceanbulks case is that, on the true construction of the co operation term, the parties obligation was to close out the open FFAs bilaterally, that is as between Oceanbulk and TMT.
TMTs case is that the meaning of the term depends upon a fact which it says was in the contemplation of both parties: viz that the FFAs between Oceanbulk and TMT were sleeved by Oceanbulk.
In para 5 of his judgment Andrew Smith J (the judge) quoted Oceanbulks summary of what the parties meant by sleeving, which the parties have agreed is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal.
It is in these terms: Sleeving is an arrangement by which one party (party B) will, at the request of another party (party A), enter into a specific FFA trade with a third party (party C) and party B will then replicate that position back to back with party A.
The usual reasons for such an arrangement are that (i) party C would not be willing to trade with party A (eg because of perceived counterparty risk) and/or (ii) party A does not wish to reveal to the market that he is seeking that position, eg because he is concerned that he will move the market.
However, once the contracts have been concluded then (absent eg an agency arrangement), the two contracts are independent and each party acts as a principal: the contracts do not necessarily remain coupled.
In para 18(1)(ii) of the re re amended defence and counterclaim TMT pleads that, in the context of the relevant negotiations, the words co operate to close out against the market mean that TMT would (if Oceanbulk so requested) assist Oceanbulk to agree fixed figures payable by Oceanbulk to counterparties to close out Oceanbulks opposite market positions; that Oceanbulk would then close out those positions; and that thereafter the FFAs between Oceanbulk and TMT would be crystallised at rates to be agreed.
As it is put in the agreed statement of facts and issues, there is therefore a dispute as to whether the closing out process envisaged by the co operation term was bilateral (on Oceanbulks case) or trilateral (on TMTs case).
The phrase opposite market position is defined in para 18(1)(i) of TMTs re re amended defence and counterclaim by references to sleeves.
TMT pleads that both parties understood that, in respect of all or substantially all the FFAs between Oceanbulk and TMT, Oceanbulk held an opposite position with other participants in the FFA market so that the liabilities TMT had to Oceanbulk were sleeved by Oceanbulk in that they were equal in amount to liabilities Oceanbulk had to counterparties under equivalent swap agreements.
In support of its case that the parties understood that the FFAs were sleeved, TMT relies upon four representations made or allegedly made by Mr Pappas on behalf of Oceanbulk.
They are pleaded in para 18(1)(i) of the re re amended defence and counterclaim and are summarised in the agreed statement of facts and issues. i) In an email dated 1 June 2008 from Mr Pappas to Mr Su of TMT he said that Oceanbulk was expecting US$40.5m from TMT on Friday, 5 June and that most of this position is in any case due to sleeves we did for you when you asked us in the past to assist.
It is common ground that this was an open communication and that it is arguably admissible in evidence on the issue of construction as part of the factual matrix. ii) TMT says that at a meeting on 5 June Mr Pappas said that he had sleeved TMTs trading at Mr Sus request.
It is common ground that this was an open meeting and that, to the extent that any such representation was made, it is arguably admissible in evidence on the same basis.
In an email dated 10 June from Mr Pappas to Mr Su he said that Oceanbulk had to pay US$40.5m on TMTs behalf against zero receipts.
The judge held that this email was sent without prejudice and there was no appeal against that finding. iii) iv) TMT says that at meetings on 19 and 20 June Mr Pappas again asserted (or allowed the negotiations to proceed on the assumption) that the FFAs were sleeved.
It is common ground that these meetings were without prejudice.
The issue between the parties is whether TMT are entitled to rely upon representations or alleged representations iii) and iv) as an aid to interpretation of the agreement.
Oceanbulk seeks to exclude the evidence relating to them on the ground that they were made in the course of without prejudice negotiations.
The construction of clause 5 will of course be a matter for the trial judge.
At para 35 of his judgment the judge expressed the view that the evidence was potentially of significant probative value and might possibly be crucial upon an issue of construction that is central to these proceedings.
By contrast, in the Court of Appeal, Longmore LJ said at para 22 that it was not entirely easy to see how the facts relied upon by TMT assisted the construction of clause 5.
It is not for this court to express a view on that question in this appeal.
For present purposes it is sufficient to note that, at any rate at this interlocutory stage, Oceanbulk does not seek to exclude the evidence simply on the ground that it does not form part of the admissible factual matrix.
It follows that it must be assumed for the purpose of this appeal that, subject to the question whether it is excluded by the without prejudice rule, the evidence will be admissible at the trial on the issue of construction of the agreement.
Indeed, given the conclusion reached by the judge, it must be assumed that (in the judges phrase already quoted) the evidence is potentially of significant probative value and might possibly be crucial upon an issue of construction that is central to these proceedings.
The judge held that the evidence was admissible notwithstanding the without prejudice rule.
The majority of the Court of Appeal (Longmore and Stanley Burnton LJJ) allowed Oceanbulks appeal, holding that the evidence was not admissible.
Ward LJ agreed with the judge and thus dissented.
This appeal is brought with the permission of this court.
Estoppel
pleads an estoppel in these terms: In para 18(1)(ia) of the re re amended defence and counterclaim TMT In its amended reply and defence to counterclaim Oceanbulk has denied that all the transactions were in fact sleeved. [TMT] will say that for the reasons pleaded in para 18(1)(i) above Oceanbulk is estopped from denying that the swap agreements Oceanbulk had entered into with [TMT] were sleeved transactions; alternatively Oceanbulk is estopped from denying that in negotiating and entering into the settlement agreement the parties were proceeding on the common assumption that they were sleeved transactions.
In support of that plea TMT seeks to rely upon representations iii) and iv).
Oceanbulk says that such reliance is excluded by the without prejudice rule.
Remoteness
Essentially the same issues arise under this head.
In para 27(2)(iii) of the re re amended defence and counterclaim TMT denies that Oceanbulk is entitled to recover the loss and damage it asserts because: (1) As pleaded in para 18 above, clause 5 of the settlement agreement was agreed in reliance upon and on the basis of Mr Pappass representation or representations on behalf of Oceanbulk and the parties understood that the swap agreements between Oceanbulk and [TMT] were sleeved transactions with the Oceanbulk opposite market positions; and (2) Accordingly, it was or should have been in the parties reasonable contemplation that closing out the 2008 FFAs left the risk of the market rising and the benefit of the market falling on [TMT] but no risk or benefit on Oceanbulk because Oceanbulk was (until completion of the closing out process) protected by Oceanbulks opposite market positions; accordingly, the loss which Oceanbulk seeks to claim is too remote and/or is not loss for which [TMT]
had assumed responsibility
TMT seeks to rely upon representations iii) and iv) in support of the case that Oceanbulks loss is too remote to be recoverable and/or that it is not a loss for which TMT assumed responsibility.
Oceanbulk says that TMT is not entitled to rely upon those representations for the same reasons as stated above, namely that they were made (if at all) in the course of without prejudice negotiations.
Without prejudice the legal principles
The approach to without prejudice negotiations and their effect has undergone significant development over the years.
Thus the without prejudice principle, or, as it is usually called, the without prejudice rule, initially focused on the case where the negotiations between two parties were regarded as without prejudice to the position of each of the parties in the event that the negotiations failed.
The essential purpose of the original rule was that, if the negotiations failed and the dispute proceeded, neither party should be able to rely upon admissions made by the other in the course of the negotiations.
The underlying rationale of the rule was that the parties would be more likely to speak frankly if nothing they said could subsequently be relied upon and that, as a result, they would be more likely to settle their dispute.
Thus in Walker v Wilsher (1889) 23 QBD 335 at 337 Lindley LJ asked what was the meaning of the words without prejudice in a letter written without prejudice and answered the question in this way: I think they mean without prejudice to the position of the writer of the letter if the terms he proposes are not accepted.
If the terms proposed in the letter are accepted a complete contract is established, and the letter, although written without prejudice, operates to alter the old state of things and to establish a new one.
It is now well settled that the rule is not limited to such a case.
This can be seen from a series of decisions in recent years, including most clearly from Cutts v Head [1984] Ch 290, Rush & Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council [1989] AC 1280, Muller v Linsley & Mortimer [1996] PNLR 74, Unilever plc v The Procter & Gamble Co [2000] 1 WLR 2436 and most recently Ofulue v Bossert [2009] UKHL 16, [2009] AC 990.
In particular, in Unilever Robert Walker LJ (with whom Simon Brown LJ and Wilson J agreed) set out the general position with great clarity at pp 2441 2444 and 2448 2449.
He first quoted from Lord Griffiths speech in Rush & Tompkins, with which the other members of the appellate committee agreed.
Rush & Tompkins is important because it shows that the without prejudice rule is not limited to two party situations or to cases where the negotiations do not produce a settlement agreement.
It was held that in general the rule makes inadmissible in any subsequent litigation connected with the same subject matter proof of any admissions made with a genuine intention to reach a settlement and that admissions made to reach a settlement with a different party within the same litigation are also inadmissible, whether or not settlement is reached with that party.
The passage quoted by Robert Walker LJ is at p 1299 of the report of Rush & Tompkins as follows: The without prejudice rule is a rule governing the admissibility of evidence and is founded upon the public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences rather than litigate them to a finish.
It is nowhere more clearly expressed than in the judgment of Oliver LJ in Cutts v Head [at] 306: That the rule rests, at least in part, upon public policy is clear from many authorities, and the convenient starting point of the inquiry is the nature of the underlying policy.
It is that parties should be encouraged so far as possible to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and should not be discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations (and that includes, of course, as much the failure to reply to an offer as an actual reply) may be used to their prejudice in the course of the proceedings.
They should, as it was expressed by Clauson J in Scott Paper Co v Drayton Paper Works Ltd (1927) 44 RPC 151, 156, be encouraged fully and frankly to put their cards on the table.
The public policy justification, in truth, essentially rests on the desirability of preventing statements or offers made in the course of negotiations for settlement being brought before the court of trial as admissions on the question of liability.
The rule applies to exclude all negotiations genuinely aimed at settlement whether oral or in writing from being given in evidence.
Robert Walker LJ observed at p 2442D that, while in that well known passage the rule was recognised as being based at least in part on public policy, its other basis or foundation is in the express or implied agreement of the parties themselves that communications in the course of their negotiations should not be admissible in evidence if, despite their negotiations, a contested hearing ensues.
Robert Walker LJ further noted that these two justifications for the rule are referred to in some detail by Hoffmann LJ in Muller v Linsley & Mortimer.
At pp 2442 and 2443 he quoted two substantial passages from the judgment of Hoffmann LJ in that case which it is not necessary to repeat here because in this appeal the issue is not so much about the scope of the rule as about the extent of the exceptions to it.
It is therefore sufficient to quote two paragraphs from the judgment of Robert Walker LJ which show that the rule is not limited to admissions but now extends much more widely to the content of discussions such as occurred in this case.
He said this at pp 2443H 2444C: Without in any way underestimating the need for proper analysis of the rule, I have no doubt that busy practitioners are acting prudently in making the general working assumption that the rule, if not sacred (Hoghton v Hoghton (1852) 15 Beav 278, 321), has a wide and compelling effect.
That is particularly true where the without prejudice communications in question consist not of letters or other written documents but of wide ranging unscripted discussions during a meeting which may have lasted several hours.
At a meeting of that sort the discussions between the parties representatives may contain a mixture of admissions and half admissions against a partys interest, more or less confident assertions of a partys case, offers, counter offers, and statements (which might be characterised as threats, or as thinking aloud) about future plans and possibilities.
As Simon Brown LJ put it in the course of argument, a threat of infringement proceedings may be deeply embedded in negotiations for a compromise solution.
Partial disclosure of the minutes of such a meeting may be, as Leggatt LJ put it in Muller, a concept as implausible as the curates egg (which was good in parts).
Finally, at pp 2448 2449 Robert Walker LJ expressed his conclusions on the cases as follows: [they] make clear that the without prejudice rule is founded partly in public policy and partly in the agreement of the parties.
They show that the protection of admissions against interest is the most important practical effect of the rule.
But to dissect out identifiable admissions and withhold protection from the rest of without prejudice communications (except for a special reason) would not only create huge practical difficulties but would be contrary to the underlying objective of giving protection to the parties in the words of Lord Griffiths in Rush & Tompkins [at p 1300] to speak freely about all issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise and, for the purpose of establishing a basis of compromise, admitting certain facts.
Parties cannot speak freely at a without prejudice meeting if they must constantly monitor every sentence, with lawyers or patent agents sitting at their shoulders as minders.
The without prejudice rule is thus now very much wider than it was historically.
Moreover, its importance has been judicially stressed on many occasions, most recently perhaps in Ofulue, where the House of Lords identified the two bases of the rule and held that communications in the course of negotiations should not be admissible in evidence.
It held that the rule extended to negotiations concerning earlier proceedings involving an issue that was still not resolved and refused, on the ground of legal and practical certainty, to extend the exceptions to the rule so as to limit the protection to identifiable admissions.
The speeches of the majority contain a number of references to the importance of the rule which are relied upon on behalf of Oceanbulk.
I take some examples.
Lord Hope said at para 12: The essence of [the rule] lies in the nature of the protection that is given to parties when they are attempting to negotiate a compromise.
It is the ability to speak freely that indicates where the limits of the rule should lie.
Far from being mechanistic, the rule is generous in its application.
It recognises that unseen dangers may lurk behind things said or written during this period, and it removes the inhibiting effect that this may have in the interests of promoting attempts to achieve a settlement.
It is not to be defeated by other considerations of public policy which may emerge later, such as those suggested in this case, that would deny them that protection.
In para 2 Lord Hope had said that where a letter is written without prejudice during negotiations conducted with a view to a compromise, the protection that these words claim will be given to it unless the other party can show that there is a good reason for not doing so.
In para 43 Lord Rodger recognised the breadth of the without prejudice rule and rejected the proposed exception.
So too did Lord Walker.
He said at para 57 that he would not restrict the without prejudice rule unless justice clearly demands it.
This seems to me to be entirely consistent with the approach of Lord Griffiths in Rush & Tompkins at p 1300C, where he said that the rule is not absolute and that resort may be had to the without prejudice material for a variety of reasons where the justice of the case requires it.
See also per Lord Neuberger at para 89, endorsing the passage from the judgment of Robert Walker LJ in Unilever at pp 2448 2449 (referred to above).
The exceptions to the without prejudice rule
The cases to which I have referred (and others) show that, because of the importance of the without prejudice rule, its boundaries should not be lightly eroded.
The question in this appeal is whether one of the exceptions to the rule should be that facts identified during without prejudice negotiations which lead to a settlement agreement of the dispute between the parties are admissible in evidence in order to ascertain the true construction of the agreement as part of its factual matrix or surrounding circumstances.
This issue must be put in the context of the exceptions which have already been permitted to the rule.
In this connection I again turn to the illuminating judgment of Robert Walker LJ in Unilever.
Having set out the general principles at pp 2443 2444 (quoted above), which included the general working assumption that the rule has a wide and compelling effect, he said at p 2444C D that there are nevertheless numerous occasions on which the rule does not prevent the admission into evidence of what one or both parties said or wrote in the course of without prejudice negotiations.
Robert Walker LJ then set out (at pp 2444D 2446D) a list of what he called the most important instances.
He described them thus (omitting some of the references): (1) when the issue is whether without prejudice communications have resulted in a concluded compromise agreement, those communications are admissible. (2) Evidence of the negotiations is also admissible to show that an agreement apparently concluded between the parties during the negotiations should be set aside on the ground of misrepresentation, fraud or undue influence.
Underwood v Cox (1912) 4 DLR 66, a decision from Ontario, is a striking illustration of this. (3) Even if there is no concluded compromise, a clear statement which is made by one party to negotiations and on which the other party is intended to act and does in fact act may be admissible as giving rise to an estoppel.
That was the view of Neuberger J in Hodgkinson & Corby Ltd v Wards Mobility Services [1997] FSR 178, 191 and his view on that point was not disapproved by this court on appeal. (4) Apart from any concluded contract or estoppel, one party may be allowed to give evidence of what the other said or wrote in without prejudice negotiations if the exclusion of the evidence would act as a cloak for perjury, blackmail or other unambiguous impropriety But this court has, in Forster v Friedland and Fazil Alizadeh v Nikbin, [1993 CAT 205], warned that the exception should be applied only in the clearest cases of abuse of a privileged occasion. (5) Evidence of negotiations may be given (for instance, on an application to strike out proceedings for want of prosecution) in order to explain delay or apparent acquiescence.
Lindley LJ in Walker v Wilsher [at] 338, noted this exception but regarded it as limited to the fact that such letters have been written and the dates at which they were written.
But, occasionally, fuller evidence is needed in order to give the court a fair picture of the rights and wrongs of the delay. (6) In Mullers case (which was a decision on discovery, not admissibility) one of the issues between the claimant and the defendants, his former solicitors, was whether the claimant had acted reasonably to mitigate his loss in his conduct and conclusion of negotiations for the compromise of proceedings brought by him against a software company and its other shareholders.
Hoffmann LJ treated that issue as one unconnected with the truth or falsity of anything stated in the negotiations, and as therefore falling outside the principle of public policy protecting without prejudice communications.
The other members of the court agreed but would also have based their decision on waiver. (7) The exception (or apparent exception) for an offer expressly made 'without prejudice except as to costs' was clearly recognised by this court in Cutts v Head, and by the House of Lords in Rush & Tompkins, as based on an express or implied agreement between the parties.
It stands apart from the principle of public policy (a point emphasised by the importance which the new Civil Procedure Rules, Part 44.3(4), attach to the conduct of the parties in deciding questions of costs).
There seems to be no reason in principle why parties to without prejudice negotiations should not expressly or impliedly agree to vary the application of the public policy rule in other respects, either by extending or by limiting its reach.
In Cutts v Head Fox LJ said (at p 316) what meaning is given to the words without prejudice is a matter of interpretation which is capable of variation according to usage in the profession.
It seems to me that, no issue of public policy being involved, it would be wrong to say that the words were given a meaning in 1889 which is immutable ever after. (8) In matrimonial cases there has developed what is now a distinct privilege extending to communications received in confidence with a view to matrimonial conciliation:
Although it is not included in that list, it is not in dispute between the parties that another of the exceptions to the rule is rectification.
A party to without prejudice negotiations can rely upon anything said in the course of them in order to show that a settlement agreement should be rectified.
It was so held at first instance in Canada in Pearlman v National Life Assurance Co of Canada (1917) 39 OLR 141 and in New Zealand in Butler v Countrywide Finance Ltd (1992) 5 PRNZ 447.
Neither case contains much reasoning but both courts treated the point as self evident.
In my opinion the parties correctly recognised such an exception because it is scarcely distinguishable from the first exception.
No sensible line can be drawn between admitting without prejudice communications in order to resolve the issue of whether they have resulted in a concluded compromise agreement and admitting them in order to resolve the issue of what that agreement was.
This can be seen most clearly where the alleged agreement is oral but, in my opinion, must equally apply where the agreement is partly oral and partly in writing and where the agreement is wholly in writing but the issue is whether it reflects the common understanding of the parties.
It was submitted on behalf of Oceanbulk that none of those exceptions applies here and that the general principle that one party should not be permitted to cross examine the other party (or its witnesses) on matters disclosed or discussed in without prejudice negotiations should be applied in its full rigour.
Although it was correctly accepted that the point for decision in this appeal was not decided in Unilever or any of the other cases, it was submitted that the decided cases, especially Unilever and Ofulue, strongly point the way.
By contrast, it was submitted on behalf of TMT that facts which (a) are communicated between the parties in the course of without prejudice negotiations, (b) form part of the factual matrix or surrounding circumstances and (c) would, but for the without prejudice rule, be admissible as an aid to construction of a settlement agreement which results from the negotiations should be admissible in evidence by way of exception to the rule because the agreement cannot otherwise be properly construed in accordance with the well recognised principles of contractual interpretation and because there is no distinction in principle between this exception (the interpretation exception) and, for example, the rectification exception.
Should the interpretation exception be recognised as an exception to the without prejudice rule?
I have reached the conclusion that this question should be answered in the affirmative for these reasons.
The principles which govern the correct approach to the interpretation of contracts have been the subject of some development, or at least clarification, in recent years as a result of a number of important decisions of the House of Lords.
The position was clearly stated by Lord Steyn in R (Westminster City Council) v National Asylum Support Service [2002] UKHL 38, [2002] 1 WLR 2956.
He summarised the position thus in para 5: The starting point is that language in all legal texts conveys meaning according to the circumstances in which it was used.
It follows that the context must always be identified and considered before the process of construction or during it.
It is therefore wrong to say that the court may only resort to evidence of the contextual scene when an ambiguity has arisen.
In regard to contractual interpretation this was made clear by Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381, 1384 1386, and in Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989, 995 996.
Moreover, in his important judgment in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912 913, Lord Hoffmann made crystal clear that an ambiguity need not be established before the surrounding circumstances may be taken into account.
As Lord Hoffmann himself put it in para 14 of his speech in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38, [2009] AC 1101, in every case in which the interpretation of the language used in the contract is in issue, the question is what a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would have been available to the parties would have understood them to be using the language in the contract to mean.
In Chartbrook the House of Lords considered and rejected the submission that what at para 42 Lord Hoffmann called the exclusionary rule, which excludes evidence of what was said or done in the course of negotiating an agreement for the purpose of drawing inferences about what the contract means, should now be abolished.
It accordingly remains part of English law.
The exclusionary rule does not exclude such evidence for all purposes.
Lord Hoffmann put it thus in para 42: It does not exclude the use of such evidence for other purposes: for example, to establish that a fact which may be relevant was known to the parties, or to support a claim for rectification or estoppel.
These are not exceptions to the rule.
They operate outside it.
It is not in dispute that, where negotiations which culminate in an agreement are not without prejudice, the exclusionary rule applies to the correct approach to the construction of the agreement.
Nor is it in dispute that in those circumstances evidence of the factual matrix is admissible as an aid to interpretation even where the evidence formed part of the negotiations.
The distinction between objective facts and other statements made in the course of negotiations was clearly stated by Lord Hoffmann in para 38 of Chartbrook: Whereas the surrounding circumstances are, by definition, objective facts, which will usually be uncontroversial, statements in the course of pre contractual negotiations will be drenched in subjectivity and may, if oral, be very much in dispute.
Trial judges frequently have to distinguish between material which forms part of the pre contractual negotiations which is part of the factual matrix and therefore admissible as an aid to interpretation and material which forms part of the pre contractual negotiations but which is not part of the factual matrix and is not therefore admissible.
This is often a straightforward task but sometimes it is not.
In my opinion this problem is not relevant to the question whether, where the pre contractual negotiations that form part of the factual matrix are without prejudice, evidence of those negotiations is admissible as an aid to construction of the settlement agreement.
The two questions are, as I see it, entirely distinct.
In these circumstances, I see no reason why the ordinary principles governing the interpretation of a settlement agreement should be any different regardless of whether the negotiations which led to it were without prejudice.
The language should be construed in the same way and the question posed by Lord Hoffmann should be the same, namely what a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would have been available to the parties would have understood them to be using the language in the contract to mean.
That background knowledge may well include objective facts communicated by one party to the other in the course of the negotiations.
As I see it, the process of interpretation should in principle be the same, whether the negotiations were without prejudice or not.
In both cases the evidence is admitted in order to enable the court to make an objective assessment of the parties intentions.
The parties entering into such negotiations would surely expect the agreement to mean the same in both cases.
I would not accept the submission that to hold that the process of interpretation should be the same in both cases would be to offend against the principle underlying the without prejudice rule.
The underlying principle, whether based in public policy or contract, is to encourage parties to speak frankly and thus to promote settlement.
As I see it, the application in both cases of the same principle, namely to admit evidence of objective facts, albeit based on what was said in the course of negotiations, is likely to engender settlement and not the reverse.
I would accept the submission made on behalf of TMT that, if a party to negotiations knows that, in the event of a dispute about what a settlement contract means, objective facts which emerge during negotiations will be admitted in order to assist the court to interpret the agreement in accordance with the parties true intentions, settlement is likely to be encouraged not discouraged.
Moreover this approach is the only way in which the modern principles of construction of contracts can properly be respected.
Any other approach would be to introduce an unprincipled distinction between this class of case and two others which have already been accepted as exceptions to the without prejudice rule.
I have already expressed the view that the rectification exception is correctly accepted because no sensible line can be drawn between admitting without prejudice communications in order to resolve the issue whether they have resulted in a concluded compromise agreement, which was the first exception identified by Robert Walker LJ in Unilever, and admitting them in order to resolve the issue what that agreement was.
There is also no sensible basis on which a line can be drawn between the rectification case and this type of case.
This can clearly be seen by a consideration of Sir Richard Buxtons article at [2010] CLJ 253 entitled Construction and Rectification after Chartbrook, where he compares the fifth principle identified by Lord Hoffmann in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society (the ICS case) and the principles of rectification.
It is not necessary to set out in full the five principles which Lord Hoffmann set out in that case at [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912H 913E.
However, his fourth and fifth principles were in these terms: (4) The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words.
The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean.
The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax: see Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] AC 749. 5) The rule that words should be given their natural and ordinary meaning reflects the common sense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents.
On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have had.
In his article Sir Richard Buxton expresses the view at p 256 that the fifth principle was revolutionary because it overrode the previous understanding that, rectification apart, the court could not depart from the words of a document to find an agreement different from that stated in the document.
Whether that is so or not, Sir Richard is in my opinion correct when he notes that the principles enshrined in ICS, especially the fifth principle, point to the close relationship between interpretation and rectification.
He notes at p 257 the essence of rectification as described in the judgment of Slade LJ (with whom Oliver and Robert Goff LJJ agreed) in Agip SpA v Navigazione Alta Italia SpA (The Nai Genova) [1984] 1 Lloyds Rep 353 at 359: In principle, the remedy of rectification is one permitted by the Court, not for the purpose of altering the terms of an agreement entered into between two or more parties, but for that of correcting a written instrument which, by a mistake in verbal expression, does not accurately reflect their true agreement.
Sir Richard then says that a closer expression of the process necessarily envisaged by principle 5 of ICS could scarcely be found.
I am not sure that I would put it quite as high as Sir Richard does but I entirely agree with him that the problems with which both the principles of rectification and the principles of construction (as explained in recent cases) grapple are closely related.
This is an important factor in leading to the conclusion that evidence of what was said or written in the course of without prejudice negotiations should in principle be admissible, both when the court is considering a plea of rectification based on an alleged common understanding during the negotiations and when the court is considering a submission that the factual matrix relevant to the true construction of a settlement agreement includes evidence of an objective fact communicated in the course of such negotiations.
For these reasons I would hold that the interpretation exception should be recognised as an exception to the without prejudice rule.
I would do so because I am persuaded that, in the words of Lord Walker in Ofulue (at para 57), justice clearly demands it.
In doing so I would however stress that I am not seeking either to underplay the importance of the without prejudice rule or to extend the exception beyond evidence which is admissible in order to explain the factual matrix or surrounding circumstances to the court whose responsibility it is to construe the agreement in accordance with the principles identified in ICS and Chartbrook.
In particular nothing in this judgment is intended otherwise to encourage the admission of evidence of pre contractual negotiations.
Conclusion
For these reasons, I would hold that evidence in support of representations iii) and iv) is in principle admissible as part of the factual matrix or surrounding circumstances on the true construction of the agreement.
It is I think common ground that it follows that it is also in principle admissible on the issues of estoppel and remoteness.
In short I have reached a different conclusion from the majority of the Court of Appeal but essentially the same conclusion as was reached by Andrew Smith J at first instance and by Ward LJ in the Court of Appeal.
For the reasons I have given I would allow the appeal.
LORD PHILLIPS
I agree with the reasoning and the conclusion of Lord Clarke.
The principle to be derived from this appeal can be shortly stated.
When construing a contract between two parties, evidence of facts within their common knowledge is admissible where those facts have a bearing on the meaning that should be given to the words of the contract.
This is so even where the knowledge of those facts is conveyed by one party to the other in the course of negotiations that are conducted without prejudice.
This principle applies both in the case of a contract that results from the without prejudice negotiations and in the case of any other subsequent contract concluded between the same parties.
Accordingly I would allow this appeal.
","This appeal concerns the scope of the exceptions to the principle that statements made in the course of without prejudice negotiations are not admissible in evidence (the without prejudice rule).
The issue is whether it is permissible to refer to anything written or said in the course of the without prejudice negotiations to help interpret any agreement which results from the negotiations.
The appellants, TMT Asia Limited and others, and the respondent, Oceanbulk Shipping & Trading SA, had entered into a number of forward freight agreements.
When the appellants failed to pay a sum due under those agreements, the parties entered into settlement negotiations which were expressed to be without prejudice.
The negotiations resulted in a written settlement agreement in respect of the sum due.
The respondent brought a claim for damages against the appellants alleging breach of a clause of the settlement agreement.
In their defence the appellants sought to rely on statements made during the without prejudice negotiations in support of their interpretation of the clause.
The respondent contended that reliance on the statements was precluded by the without prejudice rule.
The High Court held that the evidence was admissible for the purpose of determining how the terms of the settlement agreement were to be construed notwithstanding the without prejudice rule.
The majority of the Court of Appeal (Longmore and Stanley Burnton LJJ), however, allowed Oceanbulks appeal, holding that the evidence was not admissible.
The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal.
The substantive judgment was given by Lord Clarke, with whom the other Justices agreed.
Lord Clarke observed that the without prejudice rule was now very much wider than it had been historically and extended to admissions made with a genuine intention to reach a settlement, including any admissions made to reach a settlement with a different party within the same litigation, and applied whether or not settlement was reached with that party: [19] [29].
The without prejudice rule was an important rule that founded upon the public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences, as well as the express or implied agreement of the parties themselves that communications in the course of their negotiations should not be admissible in evidence: [24].
Because of the importance of the without prejudice rule, its boundaries should not be lightly eroded.
Nevertheless, the authorities
clearly established that resort might be had to without prejudice material by way of exception to the rule where the justice of the case required it: [30] [33].
The central issue in the present case was whether one of the exceptions to the rule should be that facts which (a) are communicated between the parties in the course of without prejudice negotiations, (b) form part of the factual matrix or surrounding circumstances and (c) would, but for the without prejudice rule, be admissible as an aid to construction of a settlement agreement which results from the negotiations should be admissible in evidence by way of exception to the rule (the interpretation exception): [35].
Lord Clarke reached the conclusion that justice clearly demanded that the interpretation exception should be recognised as an exception to the without prejudice rule for two principal reasons: [36] and [46].
Without recourse to the without prejudice material the agreement could not be properly construed in accordance with the well recognised principles identified in Investors Compensations Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896 and Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38, [2009] AC 1101 that objective facts which emerge during negotiations are admissible as part of the factual matrix in order to assist courts to interpret an agreement in accordance with the parties true intentions.
The process of interpretation of a settlement agreement should in principle be the same, whether negotiations are without prejudice or not, and permitting recourse to the without prejudice material for this purpose was the only way in which the modern principles of contractual interpretation could be properly respected: [36] [41].
Any other approach would introduce an unprincipled distinction between this class of case and two other exceptions to the without prejudice rule.
The first such exception, which has already been accepted, is that resort might be had to without prejudice material in order to resolve the issue whether negotiations had resulted in a concluded compromise agreement.
The second such exception (which has not yet been accepted) followed from the first, namely that if a party could have resort to without prejudice material to see whether negotiations had resulted in a concluded settlement agreement, then a party could also rely on such material in order to show that a settlement agreement should be rectified.
There was no sensible basis on a which a line could be drawn between admitting without prejudice communications in order to consider a plea of rectification and admitting them as part of the factual matrix relevant to the true construction of a settlement agreement: [42] [45].
Lord Clarke stressed that nothing in the judgment was intended to underplay the importance of the without prejudice rule or to encourage the admission of evidence of pre contractual negotiations beyond that which is admissible in order to explain the factual matrix or surrounding circumstances: [46].
"
uksc-2015-0238,"The Mental Capacity Act 2005 established a comprehensive scheme for decision making on behalf of people who are unable to make the decision for themselves.
The decision maker whether a carer, donee of a power of attorney, court appointed deputy or the court stands in the shoes of the person who is unable to make the decision known as P and makes the decision for him.
The decision has to be that which is in the best interests of P.
But it is axiomatic that the decision maker can only make a decision which P himself could have made.
The decision maker is in no better position than P. So what is the decision maker to do if he has reached the conclusion that a particular course of action is in the best interests of P but the body who will be required to provide or fund that course of action refuses to do so? Specifically, what is the role of the Court of Protection where there is a dispute between the providers or funders of health or social care services for a person who lacks the capacity to make the decision for himself and members of his family about what should be provided for him?
The facts
MN is a profoundly disabled young man, born in November 1993, so now in his early twenties.
In the words of the trial judge, Eleanor King J, at [2013] EWHC 3859 (COP), [2014] COPLR 11, para 6, he has severe learning and physical disabilities together with autism and an uncommon epileptic condition resulting in frequent seizures and risk of sudden death.
A nurse has to be available at all times to administer emergency drugs to MN if the need arises.
MN had poor muscle tone and uses a wheelchair.
He is doubly incontinent.
MN has the cognitive ability of a child aged less than 1 year.
He has no speech but can express his feelings by facial expression, sounds and gestures.
MN needs help with feeding as he is vulnerable to choking; he requires 2:1 care with his personal care and accessing the community.
Overall MN has to have his carers nearby at all times and during the night MN has one sleeping member of staff and one member of staff who stays awake to look after him.
MN is one of six siblings.
He has two brothers, BN and DN, who are also profoundly disabled and live in residential care.
He has two sisters who continue to live with their parents and another brother who lives independently.
As Bracewell J put it in care proceedings in the Family Division: To care for three such children, requiring constant 24 hour supervision is a Herculean task which this family as a team has undertaken with love and total commitment.
The closeness of the family is striking.
The physical care and attention to safety has been exemplary.
All the family have been involved with every aspect of minute by minute care and supervision.
There is no doubt that love and commitment have been shown to these children to the highest degree.
Nevertheless, despite these heroic efforts, the family were unable to cater for all their childrens needs, nor were they able to co operate with the authorities in doing so.
Hence the need for care proceedings.
A care order was made in respect of MN in December 2001 when he was just eight years old.
Bracewell J found that his father had a long history of obstruction of professionals, of refusal to co operate with authority and of being intimidating to anyone with whom he disagreed.
At its height, he received a custodial sentence for assaulting a social worker.
An application to discharge the care order was refused in July 2005 when MN was 11.
Bracewell J found that history had repeated itself in the intervening years.
Accordingly, MN was still in the care of the local authority in August 2011.
He was due to reach the age of 18 in November 2011, on which date the care order would come to an end (Children Act 1989, section 91(12)).
The local authority, predicting that the parents would not see eye to eye with the authorities about what would then be best for MN, issued proceedings in the Court of Protection, seeking orders that: (1) MN reside in such accommodation and receive such education and care as directed by the local authority. (2) MNs contact with his mother, father and other family members be regulated by the local authority and be supervised by such persons when appropriate as the local authority directed.
On MNs 18th birthday, responsibility for his care was taken over by the National Health Service, now the local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) responsible for commissioning care for him.
MN has been assessed as having a primary health need (under regulation 21 of the National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012, SI 2012/2996).
Two days later, with the permission of the Court, he moved to the residential care home where he now lives.
It was not in dispute that MN lacks the capacity both to conduct this litigation and to make decisions about his residence, education or the arrangements for his care or contact with his family.
Declarations to that effect have been made by consent.
He is represented by the Official Solicitor in these proceedings.
The Official Solicitor instructed an independent social worker to report on MNs best interests in respect of his residence, care, education and contact.
The social worker has produced three reports in the course of these protracted proceedings.
His position since 2011 has been that the care home where MN lives provides a safe, settled and supportive environment for him.
The parents have for the time being accepted that this is where he should stay, although it is clear that their ultimate aim is for him to come and live with them.
Despite their difficulties in working with MNs father and mother, the care home has instigated much more relaxed arrangements for contact with MN.
At the time of the hearing before Eleanor King J, the plan was that, providing they gave the home one hours notice (as did the families of all the other residents), they could visit whenever they chose during the day.
There are also periodic meetings at a caf and arrangements for him to meet his brothers BN and DN, who are also in residential care.
Thus, by the time of the hearing, the issues between the CCG and the parents had narrowed to two.
First, the parents wished for MN to come and visit them in their home, some six miles away from his care home.
An occupational therapist had assessed the home and concluded that it could accommodate MN and his wheelchair for a short visit.
But trained carers would have to go with him, be allowed into the home to settle him down, and wait outside while he was there (the parents have been reluctant to allow professionals into their home).
One of the carers would have to be trained to administer emergency medication if required.
Only the care home manager and her deputy were willing to do this, the rest of her staff fearing that the parents would not co operate, would interfere with the care they provided for MN and would be aggressive and intimidating towards them.
Hence the care home was unwilling to facilitate MNs visits to the family home, which would therefore require alternative carers to be trained and paid to do so.
Second, MNs mother wished to be allowed to assist the care home staff with his intimate care when she was visiting him there.
The independent social worker thought that MNs interaction with his mother in this way could form an important element in his quality of life, provided that she was able to work with the staff.
Once again, the care home was not willing to allow this.
This was due partly to fears as to the mothers co operation but also because the parents had declined an offer of the necessary training in manual handling.
MN is a grown man whose limbs can thrash around, particularly if he has a fit, which can happen at any time without warning.
The final hearing of the application, initially made by the local authority but now maintained by both the CCG (as lead applicant) and the local authority, was listed for three days in November 2013.
Voluminous evidence no fewer than 2,029 pages, including 1,289 pages of expert evidence, contained in five lever arch files and position statements had been filed.
The independent social worker was due to attend.
The CCG had written in October making its final proposals for contact between MN and his family.
The CCGs position was that it was not in MNs best interests for his mother to be involved in his personal care or for him to have visits to the family home.
The staff were unwilling to facilitate this and the CCG was not prepared to fund alternatives.
The Official Solicitor, for MN, supported the CCGs position.
The parents disputed their position and the reasons for it.
In particular, they claimed that the care homes fears about lack of co operation were unwarranted and that the mother was now prepared to undergo the necessary training.
At 11.32 pm on the day before the hearing was due to begin, counsel for the local authority emailed the other parties to give notice of her intention to argue that the Court of Protection had no jurisdiction to decide the issues.
The matters that the parents wanted were not on the table given that the CCG had said that it was not willing to allow or to arrange them, or to commission staff or to fund the necessary resources.
These were public law decisions which could only be challenged by way of judicial review.
The Court of Protection could only decide between the available options, making a choice that MN could make if he were able, and it was inappropriate to use the proceedings to try and obtain a best interests declaration in order to influence a public law decision.
It was, to say the least, unfortunate that the legal issue was raised so late in the day.
It had been foreshadowed in a position statement from the local authority in August 2013 but at a directions hearing later that month directions were given for the filing of further evidence and the parties had prepared for a three day trial of the disputed issues of fact.
No skeleton argument raising a preliminary issue of law had been filed.
The parents came to court expecting the court to consider the contact issue over three days in which witnesses would be called and cross examined, after which the court would decide whether what they wanted or what the authorities proposed was in MNs best interests.
They could be forgiven for feeling a burning sense of injustice at what took place instead.
On the first day, Eleanor King J heard argument on the legal issue, which she labelled jurisdictional issues in her judgment.
Counsel for the parents raised no objection, being aware of the issue and familiar with the authorities.
Written submissions on human rights issues were also made on behalf of the father and responded to jointly by the CCG and local authority.
The judge then spent the next day writing a judgment, correctly described by Sir James Munby P in the Court of Appeal as detailed and careful: [2015] EWCA Civ 411; [2016] Fam 87, para 50.
She delivered this on the third day (and perfected it later).
She accepted the argument put forward by the local authority and CCG and declined to embark upon a hearing of the evidence or resolving the factual disputes.
Her conclusion was that the Court of Protection has no greater powers than the patient would have if he were of full capacity.
As she explained, at para 53: If MN had capacity, but required the type of nursing care he currently needs due only to his physical needs, he might wish his mother to assist with his personal care.
The care providers may, as here, be unwilling to allow this for whatever reason; perhaps health and safety issues or difficult relationships with MNs mother.
MN with capacity would have the following options: (i) accept the conditions of residence at the care providers establishment, (ii) privately fund his care elsewhere, or (iii) seek to negotiate with the ACCG in the hope of them agreeing to fund his removal to a different residential unit which would allow his mother to assist with his personal care.
What MN with capacity would not be able to do is to force, by way of court order or otherwise, the care providers to agree to his mother coming into their facility and assisting with his intimate care.
Judicial review was the only proper vehicle through which to challenge unreasonable or irrational decisions made by care providers and other public authorities.
In rare cases where a public authority might be acting in breach of convention rights by refusing to fund a particular form of care that could be raised in the Court of Protection by way of a formal application under section 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
In this case, as contact at the family home was not an available option now or in the foreseeable future, the court should not embark upon a best interests analysis of contact at the parents house as a hypothetical possibility.
Hence she was satisfied that the contact plan now proposed by the CCG was in MNs best interests.
She therefore made a comprehensive order, among other things, declaring (1) that it was in MNs best interests to continue to reside and receive care at his current care home or, should that come to an end for any reason or the CCG or public body responsible for his residence and care decide that it is no longer in his interests, to move to and reside and receive care at a placement identified by them; and (2) that it was in MNs best interests to have contact with his parents and other members of his family in accordance with the detailed plan set out in a schedule.
Both parents appealed to the Court of Appeal.
The President observed that the appeal raised fundamental questions as to the nature of the Court of Protections jurisdiction and, in particular, the approach it should adopt when a care provider is unwilling to provide, or to fund, the care sought, whether by the patient or, as here, by the patients family (para 9).
In his extensive review of the authorities, he took as his starting point the principle in A v Liverpool City Council [1982] AC 363, that the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to children should not be used to circumvent or challenge the statutory powers and duties of local authorities in relation to children in their care (para 11).
He concluded that the judge was right in all respects and essentially for the reasons she gave (para 79).
He gave four reasons why the Court of Protection should not embark on the kind of process for which the parents contended: first, it is not its proper function to embark upon a factual inquiry into some abstract issue the answer to which cannot affect the outcome of the proceedings before it; second, it should not embark upon such an enquiry in order to provide a platform or springboard for possible future proceedings in the administrative court; third, such an exercise runs the risk of confusing the different perspectives and principles governing the exercise by the Court of Protection of its functions and the exercise by a public authority of its functions; and fourth, it would risk exposing the public authority to impermissible pressure (para 82).
This appeal
The father, with the mothers support, now appeals to this Court.
On behalf of the father, Ms Kerry Bretherton QC makes essentially the argument that she made below.
The Court of Protection has power under section 16(2)(a) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to make a decision on any matter in relation to which P lacks the capacity to decide.
Among the examples given in section 17 of the use of the courts powers under section 16 in relation to personal welfare is deciding what contact, if any, P is to have with any specified person.
Hence the court has jurisdiction to make that decision.
Any decision made on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be made in his best interests.
Only once that decision is made should the funding options be considered.
She accepts that the court has no power to order the CCG to fund what the court considers to be in Ps best interests.
But the CCG can be expected to give careful consideration to the courts findings on disputed issues of fact, such as, in this case, the willingness of the parents to co operate with the authorities and the care home staff and what would actually be required to make their proposals viable.
If the CCG maintains its refusal to fund whatever the court thinks best, that can be challenged in judicial review proceedings, albeit only on the usual judicial review grounds, or under the Human Rights Act 1998 on human rights grounds.
In other words, as Eleanor King J put it, Best interests first; Judicial Review second (para 51).
Otherwise, a public authority would be able to cut off the Court of Protections best interests inquiry at the outset, simply by refusing to provide or fund anything other than its own proposals.
Ms Weereratne QC, on behalf of the mother, supports that case.
She emphasises that there were factual disputes relevant to the two issues in the case which were important to MNs quality of life; that the individuals preferences are at the centre of the care planning process and that it is the function of the Court of Protection to substitute for the preferences of a person who cannot decide or articulate them for himself; and that this approach would be more consistent with the equality and non discrimination principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which are taken into account by the European Court of Human Rights in its interpretation of the Convention rights: see, most recently, AN v Lithuania, Application No 17280/08, Judgment of 31 May 2016, where the court cited article 12 of the Convention (para 69) and held that where a measure of protection is necessary, it should be proportionate to the degree of incapacity and tailored to the individuals circumstances and needs (para 124).
The approach adopted in the courts below was supported, albeit with nuanced variations, by Mr Hugh Southey QC on behalf of the CCG and Mr Richard Gordon QC on behalf of the Official Solicitor as litigation friend of MN.
Despite the wealth of authority cited in the courts below, the applicable principles are readily established from a combination of the fundamental purpose and specific provisions of the 2005 Act and the decisions of this Court and its predecessor in the House of Lords.
The Mental Capacity Act 2005
The Mental Capacity Act 2005 had its origins in a project begun by the Law Commission in 1989, with the encouragement of, among others, the Mental Health Sub Committee of The Law Society.
The Commission published four Consultation Papers: Mentally Incapacitated and Decision Making: An Overview (CP No 119, 1991); Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Decision Making: A New Jurisdiction (CP No 128, 1993); Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Decision Making: Medical Treatment and Research (CP No 129, 1993); and Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Other Vulnerable Adults: Public Law Protection (CP No 130, 1993).
The Commissions Report, Mental Incapacity (Law Com No 231), was published in 1995.
This was followed by a Consultation Paper issued by the Lord Chancellors Department, Who Decides? Making Decisions on behalf of Mentally Incapacitated Adults (1997, Cm 3803), which followed closely the Law Commissions proposals.
The Governments conclusions were set out by the Lord Chancellors Department in Making Decisions: The Governments proposals for making decisions on behalf of mentally incapacitated adults (1999, Cm 4465).
This adopted most of the principles put forward and recommendations made by the Law Commission.
After pre legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Incapacity Bill (Session 2002 03, HL 189, HC 1083), the Bill which became the Mental Capacity Act was passed by 2005 and came into force in 2007.
Both the Law Commissions and the Governments consultations revealed wide spread support for legislation along the lines proposed amongst health and social care professionals, carers and voluntary organisations catering for mentally disabled adults and their families and carers, as well as among lawyers and the judiciary.
The Law Commissions project had begun before the decision of the House of Lords in In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1.
At that time, there was no person with legal authority to make decisions on behalf of an adult who was unable to make them for himself, unlike the parent of a child who lacked the competence to do so.
There was no jurisdiction in any court to appoint such a person or to take the decision itself.
The old but little used power of the old Court of Protection to appoint a committee of the person was abolished when the Mental Health Act 1959 came into force.
But there was no statutory procedure under the 1959 Act to take its place.
A person who did have capacity was not able to appoint another person to make decisions about his personal welfare, as opposed to his property and affairs, should he lose capacity in the future.
Hence, the decision in In re F was greeted with great relief, especially among health care professionals.
The House of Lords held that the defence of necessity meant that it was lawful for such professionals and other carers to do what was in the best interests of a person who lacked the capacity to decide for himself whether it should be done.
That principle has found its way, with qualifications, into section 5 of the 2005 Act.
The House of Lords also held that the High Court had an inherent jurisdiction to make declarations in advance that a particular course of action would, or would not, be lawful in accordance with that principle.
Nevertheless, there was still support for legislation.
This would have four main purposes: it would place the necessity principle on a statutory footing; it would clarify the tests, both for incapacity and for the best interests principle; it would provide for lasting powers of attorney in relation to personal welfare decisions as well as decisions relating to property and affairs; and it would provide a new jurisdiction, in a newly constituted Court of Protection, with powers actually to take decisions on behalf of people unable to take them for themselves, or to appoint deputies to do so, as well as to make declarations as to whether or not they lacked that capacity and as to whether or not a particular course of action or inaction would be lawful.
Since that time, the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court has been held to encompass situations in which the necessity doctrine does not arise, because there is no tort to which a defence is required, but there is still jurisdiction to declare whether something is, or is not, in a persons best interests: see St Helens Borough Council v PE [2006] EWHC 3460 (Fam); [2007] 2 FLR 1115.
It has also been held that the 2005 Act has not abolished the inherent jurisdiction, which continues to exist alongside the new jurisdiction: see Westminster City Council v C [2008] EWCA Civ 198; [2009] Fam 11.
Nevertheless, the great majority of cases are brought in the Court of Protection.
It will be apparent from the above account that the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection (and for that matter the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court relating to people who lack capacity) is limited to decisions that a person is unable to take for himself.
It is not to be equated with the jurisdiction of family courts under the Children Act 1989, to take children away from their families and place them in the care of a local authority, which then acquires parental responsibility for, and numerous statutory duties towards, those children.
There is no such thing as a care order in respect of a person of 18 or over.
Nor is the jurisdiction to be equated with the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court.
Both may have their historical roots in the ancient powers of the Crown as parens patriae over people who were then termed infants, idiots and the insane.
But the Court of Protection does not become the guardian of an adult who lacks capacity and the adult does not become the ward of the court.
So what powers does the court have? By section 15(1) and (2) it has power to make declarations as to (a) whether a person has or lacks capacity to make a decision specified in the declaration; (b) whether a person has or lacks capacity to make decisions on such matters as are described in the declaration; (c) the lawfulness or otherwise of any act (including an omission or course of conduct) done, or yet to be done, in relation to that person.
It will be seen from this that the Act focusses on capacity in relation to a specific decision or matter.
This is consistent with the underlying principles of the Act.
By section 1(2), a person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks it.
Under section 2(1), the question is whether a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter.
There will be people, of whom MN is probably one, who lack capacity in relation to virtually every decision in their life.
But the Act recognises that capacity is variable and may fluctuate.
A person may be perfectly capable of taking some decisions but not others.
A person may be perfectly capable of taking the decision at some times or in some circumstances but not in others.
In the Court of Appeal in this case, Sir James Munby P pointed out that the still inveterate use of orders in the form of declaratory relief might be thought to be in significant part both anachronistic and inappropriate (para 88).
The scope of the declarations which may be made by the Court of Protection under section 15 may be narrower than the scope of those which may be made in the High Court: see XCC v AA [2012] EWHC 2183 (COP); [2013] 2 All ER 988.
But the Court of Protection has the much wider powers of making decisions and appointing deputies under section 16 (para 88).
And declarations have no coercive effect (para 90).
All in all, he concluded it might be thought that, unless the desired order clearly falls within the ambit of section 15 , orders are better framed in terms of relief under section 16 (para 91).
With respect, this is a view that I share.
Section 16 applies if a person (P) lacks capacity in relation to a matter or matters concerning (a) Ps personal welfare, or (b) Ps property and affairs (section 16(1)).
The court may then (a) by making an order, make the decision or decisions on Ps behalf in relation to the matter or matters, or (b) appoint a person (a deputy) to make decisions on Ps behalf in relation to the matter or matters (section 16(2)).
But (a) a decision by the court is to be preferred to the appointment of a deputy to make a decision, and (b) the powers conferred on a deputy should be as limited in scope and duration as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances (section 16(4)).
This approach is consistent with the least restrictive alternative principle, enacted in section 1(6): Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the persons rights and freedom of action.
It also points up another distinction between the 2005 Act and the Children Act 1989: the 2005 Act does not contemplate as a norm the conferring of the full gamut of decision making power, let alone parental responsibility, over an adult who lacks capacity.
Note that a court order under section 16(2)(a) simply makes the decision.
There is no need to declare that the decision made is in Ps best interests, and that may be another reason for preferring orders to declarations.
Section 16 also confers various ancillary powers upon the court (sections 16(5), (7) and (8)).
It also provides that the court may make the order, give the directions or make the appointment on such terms as it considers are in Ps best interests, even though no application is before the court for an order, directions or an appointment on those terms (section 16(6)).
In this respect, the powers of the court do resemble those of the family courts in relation to children, as do its more flexible procedures (of which more later).
Section 17(1) provides that: The powers under section 16 as respects Ps personal welfare extend in particular to (a) deciding where P is to live; (b) deciding what contact, if any, P is to have with any specified persons; (c) making an order prohibiting a named person from having contact with P; (d) giving or refusing consent to the carrying out or continuation of a treatment by a person providing health care for P; (e) giving a direction that a person responsible for Ps health care allow a different person to take over that responsibility.
This is not an exhaustive list and there are various limitations on the powers of deputies (sections 17(2), 20).
But it is worth noting that section 17(1) does not say, for example, (a) deciding that a named care home must accommodate P, or (b) deciding that a particular person must go and see P whether he wants to or not, or (d) deciding that a person providing health care must provide a particular treatment for P, or (e) deciding that a named person must take over responsibility for Ps health care.
This is consistent with what was said in the Law Commissions report (Law Com No 231), at para 8.19: Some consultees asked whether the courts power to make an order about where the person should live might provide a route to challenge a care plan made by a local social services authority under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.
We trust it is clear from the draft Bill that the court only has power to make any decision which the person without capacity could have made.
Its role is to stand in the shoes of the person concerned.
If that person has no power, under the community care legislation, to demand the provision of particular services then the court can do no such thing on his or her behalf.
The Government echoed this in its white paper, Making Decisions (Cm 4465), at para 7.18: The Law Commission stressed that the court should have no powers to make decisions which the person without capacity could not have made, even if they had retained their capacity.
The court could not, for example, refuse basic care.
It is also consistent with what was said in this Court in Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust v James [2013] UKSC 67; [2014] AC 591, at para 18: The judge began in the right place.
He was careful to stress that the case was not about a general power to order how the doctors should treat their patient.
This Act is concerned with enabling the court to do for the patient what he could do for himself if of full capacity, but it goes no further.
On an application under this Act, therefore, the court has no greater powers than the patient would have if he were of full capacity.
Of course, there are circumstances in which a doctors common law duty of care towards his patient requires him to administer a particular treatment, but it is not the role of the Court of Protection to decide that.
Nor is that court concerned with the legality of NHS policy or guidelines for the provision of particular treatments.
Its role is to decide whether a particular treatment is in the best interests of a patient who is incapable of making the decision for himself.
Eleanor King J provided an excellent example of how that principle applies to the circumstances of this particular case, in the passage quoted at para 14 above.
Of course, a person who has the capacity to take a decision for himself may do so for a good reason, a bad reason or no reason at all.
The 2005 Act reflects this by providing, in section 1(4), that A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision.
Courts and people who take decisions on behalf of a person who is unable to take them for himself, on the other hand, have to take such decisions in the best interests of that person.
Section 1(5) provides that An act done, or decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests.
Section 4 then goes into some detail about the steps which must be taken to arrive at the conclusion as to what is in his best interests.
These include considering his past and present wishes and feelings, the beliefs and values likely to influence his decision if he had capacity, and other factors which he would be likely to consider if able to do so (section 4(6)).
In other words, it is a decision about what would be best for this particular individual, taking into account, so far as practicable, his individual characteristics, likes and dislikes, values and approach to life.
He must also be involved in the decision as far as reasonably practicable (section 4(4)).
So how is the courts duty to decide what is in the best interests of P to be reconciled with the fact that the court only has power to take a decision that P himself could have taken? It has no greater power to oblige others to do what is best than P would have himself.
This must mean that, just like P, the court can only choose between the available options.
In this respect, the Court of Protections powers do resemble the family courts powers in relation to children.
The family court must also decide what is in the best interests of the child although in the Children Act 1989 this concept is not express but implicit in the courts duty to regard the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration (1989 Act, section 1(1)).
But the court cannot oblige an unwilling parent to have the child to live with him or even to have contact with him, any more than it can oblige an unwilling health service to provide a particular treatment for the child.
This was explained in the case of Holmes Moorhouse v Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council [2009] UKHL 7; [2009] 1 WLR 413, at para 30: When any family court decides with whom the children of separated parents are to live, the welfare of those children must be its paramount consideration: the Children Act 1989, section 1(1).
This means that it must choose from the available options the future which will be best for the children, not the future which will be best for the adults.
It also means that the court may be creative in devising options which the parents have not put forward.
It does not mean that the court can create options where none exist. (Emphasis supplied)
The Holmes Moorhouse case is important for another reason.
It demonstrates how the family court is operating on a different plane and on different principles from a public authority which is deciding how to exercise its statutory powers and duties to provide services.
The parents of three children had separated, the mother remaining in the matrimonial home and the father being ordered to leave.
The family court made a shared residence order, by consent, that the children should live with each parent.
The father then applied to the local authority to be housed under its duties to the homeless under Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996.
These duties vary depending, among other things, upon whether an applicant is in priority need.
Those in priority need include A person with whom dependent children reside or might reasonably be expected to reside (section 189(1)(b)).
The father argued that it was reasonable to expect the children to live with him as the family court had ordered that they should.
The local authority decided that it was not.
The Court of Appeal held that the shared residence order meant that it was.
The House of Lords disagreed.
Lord Hoffmann explained, at para 14, that the questions for the family court and for the local authority were not the same: The question which the housing authority therefore had to ask itself was whether it was reasonably to be expected, in the context of a scheme for housing the homeless, that children who already had a home with their mother should be able also to reside with the father.
In answering this question, it would no doubt have to take into account the wishes of both parents and the children themselves.
It would also have to have regard to the opinion of a court in family proceedings that shared residence would be in the interests of the children.
But it would nevertheless be entitled to decide that it was not reasonable to expect children who were not in any sense homeless to be able to live with both mother and father in separate accommodation.
The authority was entitled to take into account the fact that housing was a scarce resource, the claims of other applicants and the scale of its responsibilities, when deciding the issue of reasonableness for this purpose.
Nor should a family court use its own powers as a way of putting pressure upon the local authority to decide in a particular way.
Other service providing powers and duties also have their own principles and criteria, which do not depend upon what is best for the service user, although that will no doubt be a relevant consideration.
The Care Act 2014, which is not relevant in this particular case but will be relevant in many which come before the Court of Protection, creates a scheme of individual entitlement to care and support for people in need of social care.
But it has its own scheme for assessing those needs (section 9) and its own scheme for determining eligibility (section 13) and then deciding how those eligible needs should be met (section 24).
The Act even provides for the possibility of introducing appeals to a tribunal (section 72), although this has not yet been done.
The National Health Service also has its own processes for assessing need and eligibility, albeit not in a legislative context which recognises individual legal entitlement.
Decisions can, of course, be challenged on the usual judicial review principles.
Decisions on health or social care services may also engage the right to respect for private (or family) life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but decisions about the allocation of limited resources may well be justified as necessary in the interests of the economic well being of the country (see McDonald v United Kingdom [2015] 60 EHRR 1).
Here again, therefore, the legal considerations, both for the public authority and for the court, are different from those under the 2005 Act.
Discussion
So how does all this fit together in a case such as this? It is perhaps unfortunate that the issue was described in the Court of Protection as one of jurisdiction and that term was used in the statement of facts and issues before this Court.
The issue is not one of jurisdiction in the usual sense of whether the court has jurisdiction to hear the case.
After all, the Court of Protection made the orders which it was asked to make in this case and no one has suggested that it had no jurisdiction to do so.
It was seized of an application properly made by the authorities responsible for providing services for MN.
The context was a care order giving the local authority parental responsibility for him which was about to come to an end.
No doubt if there had been no dispute with the family about his care, there would have been no need to make an application.
Section 5 of the 2005 Act gives a general authority, to act in relation to the care or treatment of P, to those caring for him who reasonably believe both that P lacks capacity in relation to the matter and that it will be in Ps best interests for the act to be done.
This will usually suffice, unless the decision is so serious that the court itself has said it must be taken to court.
But if there is a dispute (or if what is to be done amounts to a deprivation of liberty for which there is no authorisation under the deprivation of liberty safeguards in Schedule A1 to the 2005 Act) then it may be necessary to bring the case to court, as the authorities did in this case.
The court clearly has jurisdiction to make any of the orders or declarations provided for in the Act.
The question is not strictly one of jurisdiction but of how the case should be handled in the light of the limited powers of the court.
What may often follow such an application will be a process of independent investigation, as also happened in this case, coupled with negotiation and sometimes mediation, in which modifications are made to the care plan and areas of dispute are narrowed, again as happened in this case.
But it does not follow that the court is obliged to hold a hearing to resolve every dispute where it will serve no useful purpose to do so.
The Court of Protection has extensive case management powers.
The Court of Protection Rules do not include an express power to strike out a statement of case or to give summary judgment, but such powers are provided for in the Civil Procedure Rules, which apply in any case not provided for so far as necessary to further the overriding objective.
The overriding objective is to deal with a case justly having regard to the principles contained in the 2005 Act (Court of Protection Rules 2007, rule 3(1)).
Dealing with a case justly includes dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues and allocating to it an appropriate share of the courts resources (rule 3(3)(c) and (f)).
The Court will further the overriding objective by actively managing cases (rule 5(1)).
This includes encouraging the parties to co operate with one another in the conduct of the proceedings, identifying the issues at an early stage, deciding promptly which issues need a full investigation and hearing and which do not, and encouraging the parties to use an alternative dispute resolution procedure if appropriate (rule 5(2)(a), (b)(i), (c)(i), and (e)).
The courts general powers of case management include a power to exclude any issue from consideration and to take any step or give any direction for the purpose of managing the case and furthering the overriding objective (rule 25(j) and (m)).
It was held in KD and LD v Havering London Borough Council [2010] 1 FLR 1393 that the court may determine a case summarily of its own motion, but their power must be exercised appropriately and with a modicum of restraint.
The court is clearly entitled to take the view that no useful purpose will be served by holding a hearing to resolve a particular issue.
In reaching such a decision, many factors might be relevant.
In a case such as this, for example: the nature of the issues; their importance for MN; the cogency of the parents demands; the reasons why the CCG opposed those demands and their cogency; any relevant and indisputable fact in the history; the views of MNs litigation friend; the consequence of further investigation in terms of costs and court time; the likelihood that it might bring about further modifications to the care plan or consensus between the parties; and generally whether further investigation would serve any useful purpose.
In this case, consideration along those lines would no doubt have produced the following conclusions.
The issues had been narrowed.
They were important for MN but not as important as the basic question of where he should live.
There were good reasons, not least in the history, for thinking that the parents wishes were impracticable and that the CCG had good reasons for rejecting them.
The Official Solicitor supported this.
In the light of the length of time the proceedings had already taken, and the modifications to the care plan which had been made in the course of them, it was unlikely that investigation would bring about further modifications or consensus.
And it would be disproportionate to devote any more of the courts scarce resources to resolving matters.
Case management along these lines does not mean that a care provider or funder can pre empt the courts proceedings by refusing to contemplate changes to the care plan.
The court can always ask itself what useful purpose continuing the proceedings, or taking a particular step in them, will serve but that is for the court, not the parties, to decide.
Conclusion
This was not a case in which the court did not have jurisdiction to continue with the planned hearing.
It was a case in which the court did not have power to order the CCG to fund what the parents wanted.
Nor did it have power to order the actual care providers to do that which they were unwilling or unable to do.
In those circumstances, the court was entitled to conclude that, in the exercise of its case management powers, no useful purpose would be served by continuing the hearing.
I accept that Eleanor King J did not put it in quite these terms (no doubt reflecting the way the issue was argued before her).
However, that is the substance of what she was doing and she was entitled in the circumstances to do it.
I would therefore dismiss this appeal and uphold the orders she made, albeit not for precisely the same reasons.
","The issue in this appeal is the role of the Court of Protection where there is a dispute between the providers or funders of health or social care services for a person who lacks the capacity to make decisions for himself and members of his family about what should be provided for him.
N is a profoundly disabled man, now in his twenties, who is part of a large, close and loving family.
His disabilities require that carers are in attendance throughout the day and night.
His parents have been unable to co operate with the authorities in meeting his needs and a care order was made in respect of N when he was eight.
This necessarily came to an end when he was eighteen.
Shortly before that point, the local authority issued proceedings in the Court of Protection seeking orders pursuant to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (the MCA) that it was in Ns best interests for N to reside in a care home and for contact with his parents to be regulated and supervised by the local authority.
Responsibility for his care passed to the National Health Service when he turned 18.
It was not in dispute that N lacked the capacity to make decisions about his residence or contact with his family, nor that for the time being the care home provides a safe and settled environment for N.
By the time of the hearing the issues between Ns parents and the respondent clinical commissioning group had narrowed to whether N could visit the family home and whether his mother could assist care home staff with his intimate care when she was visiting him there.
The respondent considered that neither was in Ns best interests: the first would require additional trained carers which it was not prepared to fund, and the care home staff had concerns about the second, after the parents had declined an offer of the necessary training in manual handling.
At the hearing the respondent argued that the Court of Protection, on Ns behalf, could only decide between the available options and that it was inappropriate to try to obtain a best interests declaration to put pressure on the respondent to make further funding available.
The judge agreed that she could not consider the parents proposals for this reason, and she declared that the contact plan proposed by the respondents was in Ns best interests.
The Court of Appeal upheld the judges decision.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Ns parents appeal.
Although the Court of Protection had jurisdiction to continue with the planned hearing, it did not have power to order the respondent to fund the parents plan, nor to order the actual care providers to do that which they were unwilling or unable to do.
The judge had therefore been entitled to conclude that no useful purpose was served by continuing the hearing.
Lady Hale, with whom all the Justices agree, gives the only judgment.
The jurisdiction of the Court of Protection is limited to decisions that a person (P) could take if he had the capacity to do so.
It is not to be equated with the jurisdiction of the courts to make orders in respect of children: under the MCA the court does not become the guardian of an adult who lacks capacity and the adult does not become the ward of the court [24].
The MCA focuses on capacity in relation to a specific decision or matter.
Rather than granting declaratory relief available under section 15, it is better if possible for the court to make orders under section 16 [26].
There is scope under section 16 for the court to make a decision on Ps behalf, or to appoint a deputy to make such decisions, and the courts powers set out in section 17 include the power to decide where P is to live and what contact, if any, P is to have with any specified persons.
These powers do not extend to decisions compelling third parties to accommodate, or meet, or to provide services or treatments for P [29].
The fact that the court has no greater power to take a decision than P would have had himself means that it too can only choose between the available options.
It resembles the inability of the family court in children cases to oblige an unwilling parent to have the child to live with him, or to oblige an unwilling health service to provide a particular treatment for the child [35].
Nor can the court use its powers to put pressure upon a local authority to make particular decisions in exercise of its statutory powers and duties to provide public services.
Such decisions can instead be challenged on judicial review principles, where the legal considerations for the public authority and for the court will be different from those under the MCA [37].
It was unfortunate in Ns case that the issue was described as one of jurisdiction since the Court of Protection clearly has jurisdiction to make declarations and orders under the MCA.
The question was rather how Ns case should be handled in the light of the limited powers of the court [38].
The court has wide case management powers, which include the identification of issues which need full investigation, and it is entitled to take the view that no useful purpose will be served by holding a hearing to resolve other issues [41].
In this case, there were good reasons for thinking that Ns parents wishes were impracticable and that the respondent had good reasons for rejecting them.
The Official Solicitor supported the respondent.
It was unlikely that investigation would bring about any further modifications or consensus and it would be disproportionate to devote any more of the courts scarce resources to resolving matters [42].
Accordingly, since the court did not have power to order the respondent to fund what Ns parents wanted, nor to order the actual care providers to do that which they were unwilling or unable to do, the judge was entitle to conclude (as in substance she had) that no useful purpose would be served by continuing the hearing [44].
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
"
uksc-2017-0096,"This appeal is concerned with the interpretation of a policy of motor insurance.
The question is whether the policy confers on the insured owner of a vehicle an indemnity against liability for damage caused to the property of a third party which was caused by his acts when he was carrying out substantial repairs to his car in the commercial premises of his employer.
The appeal also raises questions about the meaning of the phrase, damage caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place in section 145 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which defines the compulsory insurance requirements for the use of vehicles on such places.
The factual background
The facts behind this appeal can be stated briefly.
In 2010 Mr Thomas Holden was a mechanical fitter employed by the appellants, R & S Pilling, who traded as Phoenix Engineering (Phoenix).
He was the owner of a car and held a motor insurance policy (the Policy) with the respondents (UKI).
On 11 June 2010 Mr Holdens car failed its MOT because of corrosion to its underside.
On the following day, he asked his employer, Phoenix, if he could use the loading bay in its premises to carry out work on his car in the hope that he could enable it to pass its MOT.
He intended to weld some plates onto the underside of the car to deal with the corrosion.
His employer agreed.
He disconnected his car battery to make sure there were no live circuits.
He then used a fork lift truck to lift the car onto the drivers side to gain access to the underside of the vehicle.
He first used a grinder to prepare the underside for welding and then welded a plate under the drivers side.
He then re connected the battery, started the car and moved it round the other way before again disconnecting the battery, and lifting it up to expose the underside on the passengers side of the vehicle.
He started welding but then stood up to answer a phone call.
When he did so, he saw flames inside the car: sparks from the welding had ignited flammable material inside the car, including the seat covers.
As the fire spread, it set alight some rubber mats which were lying close to the car.
The fire then took hold in Phoenixs premises and in adjoining premises and caused substantial damage before it was put out.
Phoenix was insured against property damage and public liability by AXA which had to pay out over 2m to Phoenix and the owner of the adjoining premises.
AXA made a subrogated claim in Phoenixs name against Mr Holden.
Mr Holdens only insurance policy which arguably might cover Phoenixs claim (the claim) is the Policy.
As a result, UKI brought an action seeking a declaration that it is not liable to indemnify Mr Holden against the claim, and AXA, denying this, counterclaimed for an indemnity.
Mr Holden was named as first defendant in the action but has taken no part in the proceedings because he is not at risk: AXA has undertaken to limit its recovery to such sum, if any, as it can obtain from UKI.
The real dispute is therefore between the two insurance companies.
At its simplest, UKI says that the Policy does not respond to third party claims involving the car while the car is being repaired on private premises, such as Phoenixs garage.
Phoenix contends that the Policy covers accidents involving the car off road and that in any event the repair of the car can properly be described either as the use of it, or as arising out of its use, on a road or other public place.
The question is the correct interpretation of the Policy against the background of domestic and EU legislation which imposes compulsory third party insurance in respect of motor vehicles.
The motor insurance policy
The documents which are relevant to Mr Holdens insurance cover are (a) the policy set out in UKIs policy booklet, (b) the certificate of motor insurance (the certificate), (c) the motor insurance schedule (the schedule) and (d) the motor proposal confirmation (the confirmation).
The policy booklet instructed the insured that he must read the four documents as a whole.
The policy booklet set out in section A the insurance cover in relation to the insureds liability to other people.
It provided in clause 1a: Cover for you We will cover you for your legal responsibility if you have an accident in your vehicle and: you kill or injure someone; you damage their property; or you damage their vehicle.
Clause 2 provided the following cover for other people: We will also provide the cover under section 1a for: anyone insured by this policy to drive your vehicle, as long as they have your permission; anyone you allow to use but not drive your vehicle, for social or domestic purposes; anyone who is in or getting into or out of your vehicle; The booklet listed what was not covered under section A, including liability for more than 20m for any claim or series of claims for loss of or damage to property, and also liability caused by acts of terrorism, unless such cover was compulsory under the Road Traffic Acts.
The booklet contained general exceptions and stated: 1.
Who uses your vehicle We will not cover any injury, loss or damage which takes place while your vehicle is being: driven or used by anyone not allowed to drive it, or used for any purpose not allowed by the Certificate of Motor Insurance or Schedule; or driven by someone who does not have a valid driving licence or is breaking the conditions of their driving licence.
This exception does not apply if your vehicle is: with a member of the motor trade for maintenance or repair; stolen or permission; or being parked by an employee of a hotel, restaurant or car parking service. taken away without your The general exceptions also excluded damage caused by war etc unless we have to provide cover under the Road Traffic Acts.
The certificate identified Mr Holden as the policy holder and specified the use limitations as use for social, domestic and pleasure purposes.
It also contained a certificate of the Chief Executive of the insurers in these terms: I hereby certify that the Policy to which this Certificate relates satisfies the requirements of the relevant law applicable in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Island of Guernsey, the Island of Jersey and the Island of Alderney.
The motor insurance schedule specified among other things the sections of the booklet which applied to the Policy and the details of the car.
The confirmation, which has no bearing on this appeal, set out in summary form details of the policy holder, the Policy, the car and method of payment of premium.
The context of compulsory insurance
i) Domestic provision: the Road Traffic Act 1988
It has, since 1930, been a statutory requirement that a driver has third party liability insurance in respect of the use of his or her vehicle on the road and it is a criminal offence if one does not.
The current statute is the Road Traffic Act 1988 (the RTA).
Section 143 of the RTA provides that it is an offence to use a motor vehicle on a road or other public place unless there is in force in relation to the use of the vehicle by that person such a policy of insurance or such security in respect of third party risks as complies with Part VI of the RTA.
Section 145 of the RTA, which like section 143 falls within Part VI, sets out the conditions which the policy of insurance must satisfy.
It provides, so far as relevant: (1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Part of this Act, a policy of insurance must satisfy the following conditions. (3) Subject to subsection (4) below, the policy (a) must insure such person, persons or classes of persons as may be specified in the policy in respect of any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to property caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place in Great Britain (Emphasis added) At the relevant time, section 145(4)(b) provided that such a policy was not required to provide insurance in respect of damage to property of more than 1m.
Section 145(3)(a) was amended by the Motor Vehicles (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/726) to add the words or other public place which I have emphasised, in order to comply with the EU directives on motor insurance, which were later consolidated in the Directive which I describe below.
Section 143 was amended in the same way.
The amendments responded to the decision of the House of Lords in Clarke v General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corpn plc and Cutter v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 1647, which had held that a road did not include a car park or other public place.
The current wording of section 145(3) is to that extent implementing the relevant EU legislation.
ii) The EU Motor Insurance Directive
Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 (the Directive) consolidates various earlier EU directives and ensures that civil liability arising out of the use of motor vehicles is covered by insurance.
Recital (2) of the Directive states: Insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles (motor insurance) is of special importance for European citizens, whether they are policyholders or victims of an accident.
It is also a major concern for insurance undertakings as it constitutes an important part of non life insurance business in the Community.
Motor insurance also has an impact on the free movement of persons and vehicles.
It should therefore be a key objective of Community action in the field of financial services to reinforce and consolidate the internal market in motor insurance.
Article 3, so far as relevant, provides: Compulsory insurance of vehicles Each member state shall, subject to article 5, take all appropriate measures to ensure that civil liability in respect of the use of vehicles normally based in its territory is covered by insurance.
The extent of the liability covered and the terms and conditions of the cover shall be determined on the basis of the measures referred to in the first paragraph.
The insurance referred to in the first paragraph shall cover compulsorily both damage to property and personal injuries.
Article 12(3) provides: The insurance referred to in article 3 shall cover personal injuries and damage to property suffered by pedestrians, cyclists and other non motorised users of roads who, as a consequence of an accident in which a motor vehicle is involved, are entitled to compensation in accordance with national civil law.
The prior judgments
In a judgment dated 19 February 2016 ([2016] EWHC 264 (QB); [2016] 4 WLR 38) which the Master of the Rolls correctly described as clear and careful, Judge Waksman QC, sitting as a Judge of the High Court (Queens Bench Division), held that UKI was entitled to the declaration which it sought.
He interpreted the Policy as extending beyond roads and public places so that its cover extended to the location of the accident on private property, if the other requirements of the Policy were made out.
But he concluded that those requirements were not made out because the accident had not arisen out of the use of the car.
The undertaking of the repair of the car was not using it: it was not being operated but was immobile and partly off the ground so that it could be worked on (para 63).
He also rejected Phoenixs argument on causation, that the fire arose out of Mr Holdens use of the car because he had been driving it before carrying out the repair or because he would be driving it after the repair.
He held (para 66): The fire was caused by and arose out of the allegedly negligent repair of the car by the use of grinders and welders without taking any precautions with regard to flammable materials in the car itself.
The Court of Appeal (the Master of the Rolls, and Beatson and Henderson LJJ) allowed Phoenixs appeal ([2017] EWCA Civ 259; [2017] QB 1357).
The Court, recognizing that the wording of clause 1a of the policy booklet was inadequate and that the policy booklet had to be read together with the certificate, held that the Policy should be read to cover the requirements of section 145(3) of the RTA, as the certificate states.
The Policy did not have the geographical limitations of the statutory provision nor was the sum insured restricted to 1m.
Section 145(3) extended the cover of clause 1a without imposing its statutory geographical limitations and did not require the owner to be in the car at the time of the accident as the express terms of clause 1a provided.
The clause as so extended covered repairs which were commonplace for drivers.
The court accordingly construed the opening words of clause 1a to mean: We will cover you for your legal responsibility if there is an accident involving your vehicle (emphasis added).
This entailed substituting there is for you have and replacing the preposition in in the express terms of the clause with the present participle involving.
As a secondary argument, the Master of the Rolls held that the repairs amounted to the use of the car under section 145(3).
He stated that that interpretation was consistent with the objective of the Directive in the light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Vnuk v Zavarovalnica Triglav dd (Case C 162/13) [2016] RTR 10, which was to protect victims of accidents caused by vehicles.
He held that a purposive interpretation of section 145(3)(a) to cover use of a car consistent with its normal function was consistent with English authorities which held that there may be use of a car when it is parked or immobilised.
The Master of the Rolls set out the following summary in para 68 of his judgment: The following propositions as to the meaning of use of the vehicle in section 145(3)(a) of the RTA can be derived from the Directive, the CJEU jurisprudence and the English authorities. (1) Use is not confined to the actual operation of the car in the sense of being driven. (2) There may be use of a car when it is parked or even immobilised and incapable of being driven in the immediate future. (3) Use of a vehicle includes anything which is consistent with the normal function of the vehicle. (4) Damage or injury may arise out of the use of the car if it is consequential, rather than immediate or proximate, provided that it is, in a relevant causal sense, a contributing factor.
The Master of the Rolls therefore concluded that Judge Waksman had made an error of principle in holding that the repair of a car is not using it for the purposes of section 145(3)(a) of the RTA.
Henderson LJ agreed with this judgment and added that he found that Commonwealth authorities from Australia and Canada, some of which take a broader approach to the interpretation of motor insurance policies, were also of assistance.
Beatson LJ agreed with both judgments.
UKI appeals to this court.
Discussion
Having regard to the statutory requirements and the terms of the certificate, the Policy must be construed so that the third party cover meets the requirements of the RTA.
The parties are agreed on that and they are plainly correct, because this can be done in this case without resort to rectification.
So far as relevant to this appeal, the RTA requires Mr Holden to be insured to cover any liability in respect of damage to property caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place .
The principal question in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal went beyond the bounds of what is required to be read into the Policy to achieve this end in holding that clause 1a of section A of the policy booklet should be read to state: We will cover you for your legal responsibility if there is an accident involving your vehicle.
In support of the view that the Court of Appeal was in error, UKI advances an argument for the first time in this court.
It submits that there is no need to read any term into clause 1a in order to include the RTA cover because the Policy provides cover in two strands.
First, there is the provision of clause 1a, whose words should be given their ordinary meaning so as to cover accidents occurring when the driver is in the vehicle wherever it is located, and, secondly and separately, there is the promise in the certificate that the Policy satisfies the requirements of the relevant law in the United Kingdom, which for present purposes is the RTA.
Phoenix challenges that assertion, submitting that the Policy follows a standard structure of insurance policies, with insuring clauses which define the cover, followed by exclusions and then by conditions.
The reader therefore looks to the insuring clause to determine the scope of cover before examining the extent of the exclusions and the conditions of cover.
The certificate, it is submitted, is simply a declaration of compliance and does not operate as an additional insuring clause.
Phoenix submits that Judge Waksman and the Court of Appeal were correct in focusing on the correct construction of clause 1a.
It is necessary therefore, first, to examine UKIs two strands argument and, secondly, if it is necessary to read words into clause 1a, to address what they are.
The two strands submission
The two strands approach can find some support in the Policys opening statement: Your policy is made up of: the Motor Proposal Confirmation; this Policy Booklet; the Certificate of Motor Insurance; and the Schedule.
You must read all these documents as a whole.
The documents must be read as a whole.
But what is the role of each document? It is clear from the certificate which I have quoted in para 9 above that UKI intended the Policy to meet the terms of the RTA.
But is the needed cover provided by the certificate or by a corrective interpretation of the insuring clause?
I am not persuaded by the two strands approach which UKI advocates.
The certificate is relevant to and forms part of the Policy because it alone states the limitations as to use which the Policy imposes (para 9 above).
Thus it is readily understandable why UKI requires the policy holder to read the four documents as a whole.
But the wording of the Chief Executives certificate distinguishes between the Certificate of Motor Insurance and the Policy when it speaks of the Policy to which this Certificate relates.
It certifies the legal effect of the Policy without purporting to provide additional cover.
My concern is also that the two strands approach does not fit in easily with the provisions of the RTA which draw a distinction between an insurance policy and an insurance certificate.
The certificate is the product of section 147 of the RTA and the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks) Regulations 1972 (SI 1972/1217) as amended (the 1972 Regulations).
Section 147 provides that an insurer issuing a motor insurance policy must deliver to the insured a certificate of insurance in the form prescribed by the 1972 Regulations.
The certificate serves as evidence of the existence of the policy, because, for example, a driver may be required by a police constable to produce the certificate (section 165) and a person against whom a claim is made must give the claimant such particulars of the policy as are specified in the certificate (section 154).
The RTA defines policy of insurance in section 161 in a non exclusive way, stating that it includes a covering note.
But the RTA also speaks of policy as something separate from the certificate of motor insurance.
For example, in section 147 the insurer issuing a policy must also deliver the certificate.
In section 144A, which creates the offence of keeping a vehicle which does not meet the insurance requirements, subsection (3) defines the first condition of meeting the insurance requirements in these terms: The first condition is that the policy or security, or the certificate of insurance or security which relates to it, identifies the vehicle by its registration mark as a vehicle which is covered by the policy or security.
The RTAs treatment of an insurance policy as a distinct concept from a certificate of insurance points against the two strands approach.
Further, if the certificate, although distinct, were interpreted as a separate contractual basis for insurance cover, questions would arise as to whether an insurer may avoid liability for a risk covered only by a certificate of insurance in circumstances in which it is barred from so doing in relation to cover under a policy.
Section 151 imposes a duty on insurers to satisfy judgments obtained against persons insured against third party risks up to the maximum at the relevant time of 1m (now 1.2m).
The section applies to judgments relating to a liability which section 145 requires to be covered by insurance and it is a liability covered by the terms of the policy (subsection (2)(a)).
In deciding whether the terms of the policy cover the liability the section disregards any requirement in the policy that the driver have a valid driving licence (section 151(3)).
The obligation to pay exists even if the insurer was entitled to avoid or cancel the policy or had avoided or cancelled it (section 151(5)).
In short, section 151 focuses on the liability covered by the terms of the policy and excludes certain terms of the policy and the avoidance or cancellation of the policy.
It does not envisage liability covered by the certificate or the avoidance or cancellation of the certificate.
I am therefore not prepared to adopt the two strands approach.
But the outcome of the appeal does not depend upon the two strands submission because I am persuaded that the Court of Appeal erred in interpreting clause 1a to include the words there is an accident involving your vehicle in place of the phrase you have an accident in your vehicle.
Reading terms into clause 1a
Three questions arise in relation to the arguments about the interpretation and application of clause 1a.
First, one must ask what is the extent of the insurance cover which section 145(3)(a) requires.
Secondly, one must ask what words should be read into the clause 1a.
And the third question is whether Mr Holdens accident falls within the wording of the clause as so interpreted.
i) What section 145(3)(a) of the RTA requires
The first question requires the court to interpret the statutory requirement that the damage to property has been caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place.
This involves the interpretation of the noun use and also of the causal phrase caused by, or arising out of.
Both predated the various EU Motor Insurance Directives and were the subject of English and Welsh judicial decisions.
In English case law use has been interpreted to extend beyond driving a vehicle so that an owner had to have third party insurance if he had the use of the vehicle on a road.
Thus, a person who left his broken down vehicle on a public road, without a battery and without any petrol in its tank, was convicted of unlawfully using the car without there being in force a third party insurance under section 35(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1930, which is the precursor of section 143(1) of the RTA: Elliott v Grey [1960] 1 QB 367, 372 per Lord Parker CJ.
Similarly, in Pumbien v Vines [1996] RTR 37, a motorist was convicted under section 143(1) of the RTA when he parked his vehicle on a public road for over seven months during which time the rear brakes seized, the tyres deflated and the gearbox ceased to contain any oil.
The statutory concept of use in this context is that the owner has an element of control, management or operation of the vehicle while it is on the road: Brown v Roberts [1965] 1 QB 1, 15 per Megaw J.
The good sense of having a broad interpretation of use in the requirement for compulsory third party insurance is clear as leaving an immobilised car on a public road may create a hazard for other road users, for example if the vehicle was left close to a blind corner.
Similar considerations apply to protect members of the public in other places to which the public have access, such as car parks.
The mischief is that an uninsured owner may not be able to compensate members of the public, who can be expected to be on a road or at a public place and who suffer personal injury or damage to property as a result of the presence of the vehicle in that place.
It is necessary also to consider the jurisprudence of the CJEU on the Directive as section 145(3)(a) should be interpreted in the light of the wording and purpose of the Directive so long as that is not contra legem: see for example, Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz (Cases C 397/01 to C 430/01) [2005] 1 CMLR 44, paras 108 114, and Dominguez v Centre Informatique de Centre Ouest Atlantique (Case C 282/10) [2012] 2 CMLR 14, paras 24 and 25.
Both Judge Waksman and the Court of Appeal discussed the CJEUs interpretation of the Directive in their reasoning.
Judge Waksman concluded that section 145(3)(a) was not compatible with the Directive; the Court of Appeal gave what I see as a strained interpretation to use to achieve such compatibility.
Recent case law of the CJEU has demonstrated a need for Parliament to reconsider the wording of section 145(3)(a) of the RTA to comply with the Directive.
As the courts below recognized, in Vnuk the CJEU held that the objective of the First to Third Directives was to protect injured parties to an accident caused by a vehicle in the course of its use, if that use is consistent with the normal function of that vehicle (para 56).
As a result, the CJEU ruled that the concept of use of vehicles in article 3(1) of the First Directive (which is materially in the same terms as article 3 of the current Directive) covers any use of a vehicle that is consistent with the normal function of that vehicle (para 59 and the dispositif).
In that case, the accident occurred when a tractor was reversing in a farmyard in order to place a trailer, to which it was attached, in a barn and the trailer struck a ladder on which the claimant was standing, causing him to fall.
The CJEU, rejecting the contention that the article covered only use of a vehicle on a public road, held that article 3(1) of the First Directive could apply to the manoeuvre of the tractor in the farmyard.
Since the judgment of the Court of Appeal was handed down in this case, the Grand Chamber of the CJEU has revisited the meaning of use of vehicles in article 3(1) of the First Directive in Rodrigues de Andrade v Salvador (Case C 514/16), 28 November 2017.
The accident in that case occurred when an agricultural tractor, which had a drum with a herbicide spraying device mounted on its back, was stationary but its engine was running to drive the spray pump for the herbicide.
A landslip, which was caused by among other things the vibrations of the tractor engine and the spray, carried the tractor away, causing it to fall down terraces and crush a worker who was working on the vines below.
The Grand Chamber held that the concept of use of vehicles covers any use of a vehicle as a means of transport (para 38).
The fact that a vehicle was stationary or that its engine was not running at the time of the accident did not preclude the use falling within the scope of its function as a means of transport (para 39).
But the concept of use of vehicles did not cover a circumstance in which the tractors principal function, at the time of the accident, was not to serve as a means of transport but to generate, as a machine for carrying out work, the motive power necessary to drive the pump of a herbicide sprayer (para 42 and the dispositif).
The judgments in Vnuk and Andrade were confirmed in a judgment of the Sixth Chamber of the CJEU, which concerned article 3 of the Directive, in Torreiro v AIG Europe Ltd (Case C 334/16) 20 December 2017, [2018] Lloyds Rep IR 418, which affirmed that in EU law the location of the use of the vehicle under the Directive is not confined to a road or other public place as had been understood in prior English jurisprudence.
I am not persuaded that section 145(3)(a) can be read down to comply with the jurisprudence of the CJEU.
In R (RoadPeace Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport [2017] EWHC 2725 (Admin), [2018] 1 WLR 1293, Ouseley J (paras 73 and 99) recorded and accepted the view of the Secretary of State for Transport and the Motor Insurers Bureau that section 145(3)(a) could not be read down and that there required to be amending legislation.
In Lewis v Tindale [2018] EWHC 2376 (QB) Soole J reached the same conclusion (paras 42 58) because reading down would go against the grain and thrust of the legislation, because it raised policy ramifications which were not within the institutional competence of the courts, and because it would necessarily impose retrospective criminal liability under section 143.
I agree.
It is important to note that EU law does not require a national court, hearing a dispute between private persons, to disapply the provisions of national law and the terms of an insurance policy, which follows national law, when it is unable to interpret national law in a manner that is compatible with a provision of a directive which is capable of producing direct effect: see judgment of the Grand Chamber of the CJEU in Smith v Meade (Case C 122/17) 7 August 2018 (paras 49, 55, 57 and the dispositif).
In that case, the requirement for third party motor insurance cover in Irish road traffic legislation did not comply with the Directive.
A motor insurance policy, which was a contract between private persons, reflected the Irish legislation.
The CJEU held that the terms of the insurance policy were not to be disapplied, notwithstanding the failure to provide the cover which the Directive required; the person disadvantaged by this failure could instead seek compensation from the member state (para 56).
On this basis, it is the cover required by the RTA, and not the extended cover which the CJEU jurisprudence now requires, which is to be read into the Policy.
The relevant use therefore is use on a road or other public place.
The matter does not stop with the interpretation of the words use of the vehicle.
It is also necessary to consider the causal phrase caused by, or arising out of the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place.
The addition of the words arising out of after caused makes it clear that there can be a causal link between use of a vehicle on a road and damage resulting from that use which occurs elsewhere.
In Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd v Lister [1956] 2 QB 180, a case which concerned the interpretation of identical words in section 36(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1930, the majority of the Court of Appeal (Birkett and Romer LJJ) held that an accident which occurred in the yard of a slaughterhouse did not arise out of use on the road.
Romer LJ (pp 211 212) opined that to hold that the accident arose out of use on a road would be stretching the language of the section beyond permissible limits.
He gave the following example to illustrate his understanding of the meaning of the statutory words: An accident is caused by the use of a vehicle on a road if it runs over a pedestrian at a zebra crossing; an accident arises out of the use of a vehicle on a road if it skids off the road and injures a pedestrian who is walking on the pavement.
Birkett LJ expressed a similar view (pp 204 205) in rejecting the idea that the accident arose out of the use of the lorry on the road because the lorry had to be driven on the road to get to the yard.
Denning LJ took a different view, holding that because the lorry was engaged in operations incidental or ancillary to a journey on the road, the accident arose out of the use of the vehicle on the road.
I agree with the majority in Romford in their interpretation of the relevant statutory words.
Their interpretation was followed in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal in Inman v Kenny [2001] EWCA Civ 35; [2001] PIQR P18.
Were an accident similar to that in Romford to occur once the RTA has been amended to comply with the CJEU jurisprudence in Vnuk and Andrade, the result of that case would probably be different.
But that does not affect the meaning of the words caused by, or arising out of the use of the vehicle.
There must be a reasonable limit to the length of the relevant causal chain.
In Malcolm v Dickson 1951 SC 542, a case about remoteness of damage in a negligence claim, Lord Birnam stated (p 544): It is of course logically possible, as every schoolboy knows, to trace the loss of a battle, or even of a kingdom, to the absence of a nail in a horses shoe.
But strict logic does not appear to me to be a safe guide in the decision of questions such as this.
I agree.
Mr Eklund QC, who appeared for UKI, submitted that Dunthorne v Bentley [1999] Lloyds Rep 560 was wrongly decided.
I would not so hold.
The case did not turn on a point of law but on the application of the law to a particular set of facts.
The Court of Appeal held in that case that the trial judge was entitled to conclude that Mrs Bentley had crossed the road and so caused the accident while she was seeking help from a colleague to continue her journey, shortly after she had run out of petrol and had parked her car at the side of the road.
The judge was entitled to conclude that the accident had arisen out of her use of the car on the road.
Mr Dunthornes claim was close to the line, as Hutchison LJ recognized, but it is not apparent to me that the outcome of that borderline case was wrong, having regard to the close connection in time, place and circumstance between the use of the car on the road and the accident.
In summary, section 145(3) of the RTA must be interpreted as mandating third party motor insurance against liability in respect of death or bodily injury of a person or damage to property which is caused by or arises out of the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place.
The relevant use occurs where a person uses or has the use of a vehicle on a road or public place, including where he or she parks an immobilised vehicle in such a place (as the English case law requires), and the relevant damage has to have arisen out of that use.
ii) What term should be read into clause 1a
In Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38; [2009] AC 1101, the House of Lords construed a formal commercial contract to cure a linguistic mistake.
The House, in the leading speech which Lord Hoffmann delivered, stated that where the context and background of a contract drove the court to the conclusion that something must have gone wrong with the language that the parties had used, the court did not have to attribute to the parties an intention which a reasonable person would not have understood them to have had.
He emphasised that it required a strong case to persuade a court that something must have gone wrong with the language (paras 14 15).
For the court to adopt a corrective construction, it should be clear that something has gone wrong with the language and it should be clear what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant. (para 25)
In this case, there is an apparent contradiction between the terms of clause 1a, if those words are given their ordinary meaning, and the promise in the certificate (para 9 above) that the Policy satisfies the requirements of UK law, including the RTA.
If, as I have concluded, the certificate is not effective to create the needed cover, there can be no doubt that it is necessary to interpret the insuring clause in the Policy so that it meets the requirements of section 145(3)(a) of the RTA by correcting the mistake in clause 1a.
This is one of those rare cases where the mistake is clear as is the intended meaning, so that a party to the agreement does not need to apply for rectification of the Policy.
The policy booklet is written in plain language for the benefit of the policy holder and lacks the precision which one might expect from a detailed commercial contract.
For example, the statement in clause 1a that UKI will give cover for the insureds liability if you have an accident in your vehicle if read strictly would not cover an accident caused by the insured opening his car door and stepping out of the car.
Yet clause 2, which appears to address the Brown judgment to which I referred in para 34 above, provides such cover for passengers getting out of the car.
It was not disputed that clause 1a should be construed as covering the insured driver stepping out of his vehicle.
Nor is it disputed that the clause must be construed so that it meets the requirements of the RTA.
But the alteration of the clause which the Court of Appeal favoured was much more radical.
In identifying the needed correction, I derive no assistance from the fact that the Policy gives extensive first party cover and cover overseas or from the fact that the maximum sum available under the Policy for third party cover far exceeds the statutory minimum.
The correction which is needed is to enable the cover to extend beyond what is expressly provided for to that which the RTA requires.
If, as is the case, the express terms of the Policy in some respects exceed what the RTA requires, those terms must be given effect.
Construction of clause 1a to expand its cover to meet the requirements of the RTA cannot cut back that which is expressly conferred.
But that which is to be added to correct the omission is that which is needed to make the cover comply with the RTA and no more.
In my view the Court of Appeal erred in not adopting this approach.
Its formulation did not confine the Policys cover to the express terms of clause 1a and such additions as were needed to meet requirements of RTA.
Instead, the formulation we will cover you if there is an accident involving your vehicle expands the cover significantly beyond both the express terms of the clause and the requirements of the RTA by removing the statutory causal link between the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place and the accident.
Indeed, the interpretation which the Court of Appeal favours appears to go beyond that which EU law currently requires.
Dealing briefly with other arguments which Phoenix has raised, I see no basis for the operation against UKI of the contra proferentem rule in this context.
The necessity for corrective construction arises from the fact that the terms to meet the legal requirements, which the Chief Executives certificate vouched, have not been expressed in the insuring clause.
There is no doubt as to what those terms are as the statutory provision provides them.
Nor do I derive any assistance by reference to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/2083) (the 1999 Regulations).
The requirement in regulation 7 of the 1999 Regulations (now section 69 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015) that the interpretation most favourable to the consumer is to prevail where there is doubt about the meaning of a written term of a contract applies, for example, in the circumstances which I have discussed in para 48 above.
But I am not persuaded that it can apply where the court, having recognized a mistake in the language used, is applying a corrective construction by reading into the clause words, which have not been expressed, to correct the mistake.
It is important to recall that a corrective interpretation is available only if it is clear what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant (para 46 above).
Nor can the fact that UKI has amended the terms of the Policy to extend its cover since the events which gave rise to the claim in this case assist the process of construction of the terms of the Policy.
In my view the appropriate corrective construction of clause 1a to give effect to the requirements of the RTA is to add the words or if there is an accident caused by or arising out of your use of your vehicle on a road or other public place.
The clause would therefore read: We will cover you for your legal responsibility if you have an accident in your vehicle or if there is an accident caused by or arising out of your use of your vehicle on a road or other public place and Clause 2 of the Policy, which I quote in para 7 above, extends this cover to the other people which it specifies, including a person insured by the policy who is driving with the permission of the insured. iii) Does Mr Holdens accident fall within clause 1a as so interpreted?
In my view, neither English domestic case law nor the jurisprudence of the CJEU supports the view that the carrying out of significant repairs to a vehicle on private property entails the use of the vehicle.
The English case law which interprets use in the RTA as having the use of makes good sense in the context of vehicles which have been left on a road or in a public place, where members of the public are likely to encounter them, but less sense if applied without qualification to vehicles located on private property.
In ordinary language one would not speak of a person who is conducting substantial repairs to a stationary vehicle as using that vehicle, but the presence of a vehicle on a road or other public place while the owner was carrying out such repairs would, in my view, fall within the mischief which section 145(3)(a) addresses.
EU law now requires the extension of compulsory third party insurance to vehicles on private property to cover use of the vehicles as a means of transport, a concept which can include parked vehicles.
I am not persuaded that a vehicle which is on its side being repaired on private property, such as a garage, is being used as a means of transport as the CJEU jurisprudence requires.
But it is not necessary to decide that point because, as the CJEU has held in Smith v Meade (para 55 above) national legislation governs and the repair did not take place on a road or other public place.
Turning to the statutory phrase, arising out of the use of the vehicle on the road, Phoenixs argument is that Mr Holdens repairs met the causal requirement either because the disrepair of the car was the result of its use or because the repair was a precursor to his getting the car back on the road as a means of transport.
The repairs, Phoenix submitted, were ancillary and incidental to the use of the car and thus the damage to its property and that of its neighbour arose out of the use of the car.
I do not accept this submission because the causal connection is too remote: viz my discussion of the Romford case in paras 42 and 43 above.
It is likely that the prior use of the car as a means of transport was either a but for cause or (for example, if, without washing the underside after use on a road, the car was parked on a private driveway or in a garage for a prolonged period) a contributory cause of the disrepair of the vehicle which necessitated the repairs.
I would accept that the repairs may properly be said to have arisen out of the use of the car as they were a response to the disrepair of that vehicle.
But it does not follow that the property damage which is the subject of Phoenixs claim was caused by or arose out of the use of the vehicle as the RTA requires.
In agreement with Judge Waksman, I consider it to be an artificial analysis to say that the property damage, which Phoenix and its neighbour suffered, was caused by or arose out of the use of the vehicle.
As he stated (para 66 of his judgment), [t]he fire was caused by and arose out of the allegedly negligent repair of the car by the use of grinders and welders without taking any precautions with regard to flammable materials in the car itself.
It was Mr Holdens alleged negligence in carrying out the repairs and not the prior use of the car as a means of transport which caused the relevant damage.
In my view, Phoenixs claim clearly falls on the wrong side of the line.
I have not overlooked the Commonwealth cases to which this court and the courts below were referred.
Some, like Elias v Insurance Corpn of British Columbia (1992) 95 DLR (4th) 303 and Pilliteri v Priore (1997) 145 DLR (4th) 531, in which repair was treated as a use of a vehicle, concerned differently worded legislation which referred to damage arising out of the ownership, use or operation of a vehicle.
The Australian cases, which Judge Waksman analysed in paras 52 57 of his judgment, appear to turn on their particular facts and two of the cases draw a distinction between repairs where the car is being prepared for use on the one hand and, on the other, circumstances in which the car is driven or some part of its mechanism is used in the course of repairs.
Like the Master of the Rolls, I do not find the Commonwealth cases helpful.
Because Mr Holden was not in his car when the accident occurred (as the express terms of clause 1a require) and because, for the reasons which I have given, the RTA does not require third party insurance cover in the circumstances of the accident in this case (with the result that the corrective interpretation does not assist Phoenix), UKI is entitled to the declaration which Judge Waksman gave in his order of 8 April 2016.
Conclusion
I would allow the appeal.
","Mr Holden accidentally set fire to his car while repairing it at the premises of his employer, Phoenix Engineering.
The fire caused 2 million of damage to Phoenix and its neighbours premises.
Phoenixs insurer (Axa) paid out and has agreed not to pursue Mr Holden personally for the money, but only his car insurance provider (Churchill).
Axa says that Mr Holden is covered by his car insurance policy's third party liability cover but Churchill says he is not.
Clause 1a of the policy says we will cover you for your legal responsibility if you have an accident in your vehicle and: you kill or injure someone; [or] you damage their property .
As required by law, the policy also includes a certificate that it satisfies the requirements of relevant legislation, which includes the Road Traffic Act 1988 (RTA).
Under the RTA, car insurance policies must provide cover in respect of any liability incurred in respect of damage to property caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place.
The High Court held that the policy did not cover Mr Holden's accident because it had arisen out of the negligent way in which it was being repaired and not out of the use of the car.
The Court of Appeal (CA) allowed his appeal.
It held that the wording of clause 1a was inadequate and had to be read with the certificate that the policy provided the cover required by law.
As the policy had no geographical limitations, no such limitations were to be imposed in extending its cover to meet the statutory requirements.
It accordingly construed the opening words of clause 1a to mean we will cover you for your legal responsibility if there is an accident involving your vehicle.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
Lord Hodge gives the only judgment.
Having regard to the statutory requirements and the terms of the certificate, which disclose the insurers intention, the policy must be construed so that the third party cover meets the requirements of the RTA [24].
As the certificate did not purport to provide any additional cover in itself, and because the relevant legislation treats a certificate of insurance as distinct from a policy, it is therefore necessary to read words into clause 1a.
However, the CA went too far by doing so in such a way as to extend cover to any accident involving Mr Holden's vehicle [25 31].
The first step is to ask what caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place means.
In English case law, the statutory word use has been interpreted broadly to cover any situation where the owner has an element of control, management or operation of the vehicle on the road or in a public place.
The reason is that even a parked car may be a hazard on a road or in such a place [32 34].
The words caused by, or arising out of the use of further extend the required cover, but there must be a reasonable limit to the causal chain [42 45].
The concept of use in EU law goes further, and is not confined to a road or other public place.
It extends to any use of a vehicle as a means of transport.
To comply with EU law, Parliament may need to reconsider the wording of the RTA.
But the RTA cannot be read down to comply by excising the words on a road or other public place because this would go against the grain and thrust of the legislation.
It is therefore the cover required by the RTA, not EU law, that must be read into the policy [35 41].
Where the context and background of a contract drives the courts to the conclusion that something has gone wrong with the language used, it may adopt a corrective construction where it is clear what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant [46 47].
Here, the necessary correction is to extend the cover beyond what was expressly provided to that which the RTA requires, and no more [48 49].
The CA erred in not adopting this approach: the formulation involving your vehicle expanded the cover significantly beyond both the express terms of the clause and the requirements of the RTA, by removing the statutory causal link between use of the vehicle on a road or other public place and the accident [50].
Nor does the statutory rule that the interpretation most favourable to the consumer must prevail apply to a situation such as this, where the court is correcting a mistake in the language used and there is no doubt about the parties intended meaning [51].
The appropriate corrective construction is therefore to read the clause as if it said we will cover you for your legal responsibility if you have an accident in your vehicle or if there is an accident caused by or arising out of your use of your vehicle on a road or other public place and [52].
Mr Holden's accident does not fall within clause 1a as so interpreted.
A vehicle being repaired on private property is not being used [53].
Furthermore, although the attempted repairs may have arisen out of the use of the car, the property damage did not.
It was Mr Holden's alleged negligence in carrying out the repairs, not the prior use of the car as a means of transport, that caused the relevant damage [54 55].
"
uksc-2010-0127,"This appeal raises a short question of construction of shipbuilders refund guarantees given pursuant to six shipbuilding contracts (the Contracts).
The Contracts, which were all dated 11 May 2007, were between each of the first to sixth claimants (the Buyers) and Jinse Shipbuilding Co Ltd (the Builder).
Under the Contracts the Builder agreed to build and sell one vessel to each of the Buyers.
The price of each vessel was US$33,300,000, payable in five equal instalments of US$6,660,000 due at specified points of time, with the final instalment payable on delivery.1 By Article X.8 of the Contracts it was a condition precedent to payment by the Buyers of the first instalment that the Builder would deliver to the Buyers refund guarantees relating to the first and subsequent instalments in a form acceptable to the Buyers financiers.
As envisaged by Article X.8, by letter dated 22 August 2007 the respondent, Kookmin Bank (the Bank), issued six materially identical Advance Payment Bonds (the Bonds), one to each of the Buyers.
The seventh claimant (the Assignee) is the assignee of the benefit of the Bonds.
On 29 August 2007, the Buyers each paid the first instalment of US$6,660,000 due under the Contracts.
On 29 September 2007, the first claimant paid the second instalment of US$6,660,000 under the contract to which it is a party.
In 2008 the Builder experienced financial difficulties and in late January 2009 it entered into and/or became subject to a debt workout procedure under the Korean Corporate Restructuring Promotion Law 2007.
On 25 February 2009 the Buyers wrote to the Builder notifying it that this development triggered Article XII.3 of the Contracts and demanding an immediate refund of all the instalments paid, together with interest at 7% per annum.
The Builder refused to make any refund on the ground that Article XII.3 of the Contracts had not been triggered as alleged.
The dispute between the Buyers and the Builder has been submitted to arbitration pursuant to Article XIV.3 of the Contracts. 1 There was subsequently a small reduction in the overall price and a corresponding reduction in the final instalment for each vessel but that is immaterial to the issues in the appeal.
On 23 April 2009, the Buyers wrote to the Bank demanding repayment under the Bonds of the instalments paid under the Contracts.
The Bank refused to pay.
It did so initially on the ground that it was not obliged to pay pending resolution of the dispute between the Buyers and the Builder.
That argument was subsequently rejected by Simon J (the Judge) and there was no appeal to the Court of Appeal against that part of his order: [2009] EWHC Civ 2624 (Comm).
The Bank subsequently raised a separate, and logically prior, argument that, on their true construction, the Bonds did not cover refunds to which the Buyers were entitled pursuant to Article XII.3 of the Contracts.
That argument was also rejected by the Judge, who gave summary judgment for the Assignee, but succeeded in the Court of Appeal, which gave summary judgment for the Bank against the Buyers and the Assignee.
In the Court of Appeal Sir Simon Tuckey agreed with the Judge but the majority, comprising Thorpe and Patten LJJ, held the Banks argument to be correct: [2010] EWCA Civ 582.
The orders of the Judge and the Court of Appeal were made on 29 October 2009 and 27 May 2010 respectively.
The Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal.
The Buyers appeal to this Court pursuant to permission granted by the Court.
The issue is whether, on the true construction of paragraph 3 of the Bonds, the Buyers are entitled to payment under the Bonds in respect of refunds to which they are entitled under Article XII.3 of the Contracts.
No one suggested that the successful parties should not have summary judgment in their favour.
The Bonds
I begin with the Bonds because it was common ground that all depends upon the true construction of the Bonds and that the terms and meaning of the Contracts are only relevant to the extent that they inform the true construction of the Bonds.
The paragraphs in the letter comprising the Bonds were not numbered but both the Judge and the Court of Appeal referred to them by number for convenience of reference and I will do the same.
As so numbered the relevant parts of each Bond were these: [1] We refer to the Contract entered into between the Builder and yourselves for the construction and delivery of the Vessel to be delivered before [31 July 2009].
Other terms and expressions used in this Bond shall have the same meaning as in the Contract, a copy of which has been provided to us. [2] Pursuant to the terms of the Contract, you are entitled, upon your rejection of the Vessel in accordance with the terms of the Contract, your termination, cancellation or rescission of the Contract or upon a Total Loss of the Vessel, to repayment of the pre delivery instalments of the Contract Price paid by you prior to such termination or a Total Loss of the Vessel (as the case may be) and the value of the Buyer's Supplies delivered to the Shipyard (if any) together with interest thereon at the rate of . (7%) per annum (or . (10%) per annum in the case of a Total Loss of the Vessel) from the respective dates of payment by you of such instalments to the date of remittance by telegraphic transfer of such refund. [3] In consideration of your agreement to make the pre delivery instalments under the Contract and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged), we hereby, as primary obligor, irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to pay to you, your successors and assigns, on your first written demand, all such sums due to you under the Contract (or such sums which would have been due to you but for any irregularity, illegality, invalidity or unenforceability in whole or in part of the Contract) PROVIDED THAT the total amount recoverable by you under this Bond shall not exceed US $[26,640,000] . plus interest thereon at the rate of . (7%) per annum (or . (10%) per annum in the case of a Total Loss of the Vessel) from the respective dates of payment by you of such instalments to the date of remittance by telegraphic transfer of such refund. [4] Payment by us under this Bond shall be made without any deduction or withholding, and promptly on receipt by us of a written demand (substantially in the form attached) signed by two of your directors stating that the Builder has failed to fulfil the terms and conditions of the Contract and as a result of such failure, the amount claimed is due to you and specifying in what respects the Builder has so failed and the amount claimed.
Such claim and statement shall be accepted by us as evidence for the purposes of this Bond alone that this amount claimed is due to you under this Bond. [5] Our liability under this Bond shall not be affected by (v) any insolvency, re organisation or dissolution of the Builder, or (vi) any other matter or thing which may operate to discharge or reduce our liability hereunder.
The Bonds further provided that they were assignable, that they were governed by English law and that all disputes arising out of them were to be determined by the Commercial Court.
The resolution of the issue between the parties depends upon the true construction of paragraph [3].
The Bank promised to pay on demand all such sums due to you under the Contract.
The question is what was meant by such sums.
Only two possibilities were suggested.
The Buyers said (and the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey held) that the expression such sums referred back to the pre delivery instalments in the first line.
They said that the purpose of the Bond was to guarantee the refund of pre delivery instalments and that the promise was therefore to refund pre delivery instalments.
By contrast the Bank said (and Thorpe and Patten LJJ held) that the expression such sums was a reference back to the sums referred to in paragraph [2], namely the repayment of the pre delivery instalments paid prior to a termination of the Contract or a Total Loss of the vessel and the value of the Buyers Supplies in the case of a Total Loss.
On the Buyers analysis the Bond guaranteed pre delivery instalments which were repayable under Article XII.3 in the case of any insolvency event, whereas on the Banks analysis it did not.
The Contracts
It is common ground that the terms of the Contracts are relevant to the true construction of the Bonds.
They are referred to in the Bonds and provide the immediate context in which the Bonds were entered into.
They are thus plainly an important aid to the meaning of the Bonds.
Article X of the Contracts provided, so far as material as follows: ARTICLE X: PAYMENT 5.
REFUND BY THE BUILDER The payments made by the Buyer to the Builder prior to delivery of the Vessel shall constitute advances to the Builder.
If the Vessel is rejected by the Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Contract, or if the Buyer terminates, cancels or rescinds this Contract pursuant to any of the provisions of this Contract specifically permitting the Buyer to do so, the Builder shall forthwith refund to the Buyer in US dollars, the full amount of total sums paid by the Buyer to the Builder in advance of delivery together with interest thereon as herein provided within thirty (30) banking days of acceptance of rejection.
The interest rate of the refund shall be seven per cent (7%) per annum If the Builder is required to refund to the Buyer the installments paid by the Buyer to the Builder as provided in this Paragraph, the Builder shall return to the Buyer all of the Buyer's Supplies as stipulated in Article XIII which were not incorporated into the Vessel and pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the cost to the Buyer of those Buyer's Supplies incorporated into the Vessel. 6.
TOTAL LOSS If there is a total loss or a constructive total loss of the Vessel prior to delivery thereof, the Builder shall proceed according to the mutual agreement of the parties hereto either: (a) to build another vessel in place of the Vessel so lost . provided that the parties hereto shall have agreed in writing to a reasonable cost and time for the construction or (b) to refund to the Buyer the full amount of the total sums paid by the Buyer to the Builder under the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this Article and the value of Buyer's Supplies delivered to the Shipyard, if any, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum .
If the parties hereto fail to reach such agreement within two (2) months after the Vessel is determined to be a total loss or constructive total loss, the provisions of (b) hereinabove shall be applied. 8.
The Builder shall as a condition precedent to payment by the Buyer of the first installment deliver to the Buyer an assignable letter of guarantee issued by a first class Korean Bank . to Buyer's Financiers for the refund of the first installment, and at the same time, together with the letter of guarantee relating to the first installment, Builder shall also deliver to the Buyer an assignable letter of guarantee issued by a first class Korean Bank . for the refund of the respective installments following the way of the payment stipulated in this Article.
The refund guarantees by the Builder to the Buyer shall be indicated pre delivery installments plus interest as aforesaid to the Buyer under or pursuant to paragraph 5 above in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A which is yet to be agreed In the event that the Refund Guarantees, for all installments, have not been provided to the Buyer in a form acceptable to the Buyers financiers and have not been issued by an entity acceptable to REFUND GUARANTEE Buyers financiers, by the 31st of August 2007 then the Buyer may cancel this Contract without penalty on either side.
It is common ground that no form of guarantee was in fact annexed to the Contracts.
Article XII provided, so far as relevant: ARTICLE XII: BUILDERS DEFAULT 3.
If the Builder shall apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee or liquidator, shall be adjudicated insolvent, shall apply to the courts for protection from its creditors, file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or take advantage of any insolvency law, or any action shall be taken by the Builder having an effect similar to any of the foregoing or the equivalent thereof in any jurisdiction, the Buyer may by notice in writing to the Builder require the Builder to refund immediately to the Buyer the full amount of all sums paid by the Buyer to the Builder on account of the Vessel and interest thereon at seven percent (7%) per annum on the amount to be refunded to the Buyer, computed from the respective date such sums were paid by the Buyer to the date of remittance of the refundable amount to the Buyer and immediately upon receipt of such notice the Builder shall refund such amount to the Buyer.
Following such refund the Builder may, but shall not be obliged to, by notice in writing to the Buyer given within ten (10) business days terminate this contract.
If the Builder does not so terminate the Contract the Buyer's obligation to pay further installments prior to delivery of the Vessel under Article X 2(a),(b),(c) and (d) shall be suspended and the full Contract price shall be paid to the Builder upon delivery of the Vessel in the manner contemplated by Article X paragraph 2(e).
The Contracts contained a number of provisions which entitled the Buyer to cancel the contract, namely Articles III.1 and XII.1 (delay) and Article III.2(b), 3(c), 4(d) and 5(d) (insufficient speed, excessive fuel consumption, deficient deadweight or cargo capacity).
Some of those provisions specifically entitled the Buyer to a refund of all advance payments following cancellation.
Others did not, although in such cases Article X.5 would apply and have the same effect.
The Contracts also contained in Article XIII further detailed provisions relating to Buyers Supplies.
The correct approach to construction
For the most part, the correct approach to construction of the Bonds, as in the case of any contract, was not in dispute.
The principles have been discussed in many cases, notably of course, as Lord Neuberger MR said in Pink Floyd Music Ltd v EMI Records Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 1429; [2011] 1 WLR 770 at para 17, by Lord Hoffmann in Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] AC 749, passim, in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912F 913G and in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] 1 AC 1101, paras 21 26.
I agree with Lord Neuberger (also at para 17) that those cases show that the ultimate aim of interpreting a provision in a contract, especially a commercial contract, is to determine what the parties meant by the language used, which involves ascertaining what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant.
As Lord Hoffmann made clear in the first of the principles he summarised in the Investors Compensation Scheme case at page 912H, the relevant reasonable person is one who has all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.
The issue between the parties in this appeal is the role to be played by considerations of business common sense in determining what the parties meant.
Sir Simon Tuckey said at para 19 of his judgment that there was no dispute about the principles of construction and the Bank so submitted in its skeleton argument.
However, I do not think that is quite correct.
At para 18 Sir Simon identified the question of construction substantially as set out in para 9 above and said at para 19: There is no dispute about the principles of construction to be applied in order to answer this question.
The court must first look at the words which the parties have used in the bond itself.
The shipbuilding contract is of course the context and cause for the bond but is nevertheless a separate contract between different parties.
If the language of the bond leads clearly to a conclusion that one or other of the constructions contended for is the correct one, the Court must give effect to it, however surprising or unreasonable the result might be.
But if there are two possible constructions, the Court is entitled to reject the one which is unreasonable and, in a commercial context, the one which flouts business common sense.
This follows from the House of Lords decisions in Wickman Machine Tools Sales Limited v Schuler AG [1974] AC 235, where at 251 Lord Reid said: The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration.
The more unreasonable the result, the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more necessary it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear. and The Antaios [1984] AC 191, where at 201 Lord Diplock said: If detailed and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business common sense it must yield to business common sense.
As I read his judgment, Patten LJ did not put the question in quite the same way.
This can be seen from paras 35 to 44 of his judgment.
At para 35 he referred to Sir Simon Tuckeys approach at para 19 (as quoted above).
He also referred to para 18(iii) of the Judges judgment, where the Judge described the Banks construction of the Bond as having the surprising and uncommercial result of the guarantee not being available to meet the Builders repayment obligations in the event of insolvency.
Patten LJ noted that the Judge appeared to have taken that into account as a factor in favour of the Buyers construction of paragraph [3] of the Bonds.
Patten LJ added that the Judges approach was the same as that of Sir Simon Tuckey.
Patten LJ then referred to the cases mentioned above and expressed his conclusion in principle thus at para 42: In this case (as in most others) the Court is not privy to the negotiations between the parties or to the commercial and other pressures which may have dictated the balance of interests which the contract strikes.
Unless the most natural meaning of the words produces a result which is so extreme as to suggest that it was unintended, the Court has no alternative but to give effect it its terms.
To do otherwise would be to risk imposing obligations on one or other party which they were never willing to assume and in circumstances which amount to no more than guesswork on the part of the Court.
Finally, at paras 43 and 44, Patten LJ quoted from the speeches of Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381, 1384 5 and of Lord Hoffmann in Chartbrook at para 20, where they discussed the reason for the rule excluding evidence of pre contractual negotiations.
In particular they stressed the irrelevance of the parties subjective intentions and noted that the mere fact that a term in the contract appears to be particularly unfavourable to one party or the other is irrelevant.
As Lord Hoffmann put it, the term may have been agreed in exchange for some concession made elsewhere in the transaction or it may simply have been a bad bargain.
I entirely accept those caveats.
However, it seems to me to be clear that the principle stated by Patten LJ in para 42 is different from that stated by the Judge in his para 18(iii) and by Sir Simon Tuckey in para 19.
It is not in my judgment necessary to conclude that, unless the most natural meaning of the words produces a result so extreme as to suggest that it was unintended, the court must give effect to that meaning.
The language used by the parties will often have more than one potential meaning.
I would accept the submission made on behalf of the appellants that the exercise of construction is essentially one unitary exercise in which the court must consider the language used and ascertain what a reasonable person, that is a person who has all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract, would have understood the parties to have meant.
In doing so, the court must have regard to all the relevant surrounding circumstances.
If there are two possible constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other.
This conclusion appears to me to be supported by Lord Reids approach in Wickman quoted by Sir Simon Tuckey and set out above.
I am of course aware that, in considering statements of general principle in a particular case, the court must have regard to the fact that the precise formulation of the proposition may be affected by the facts of the case.
Nevertheless, there is a consistent body of opinion, largely collated by the Buyers in an appendix to their case, which supports the approach of the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey.
Where the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply it.
This can be seen from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Co operative Wholesale Society Ltd vs National Westminster Bank plc [1995] 1 EGLR 97.
The court was considering the true construction of rent review clauses in a number of different cases.
The underlying result which the landlords sought in each case was the same.
The court regarded it as a most improbable commercial result.
Where the result, though improbable, flowed from the unambiguous language of the clause, the landlords succeeded, whereas where it did not, they failed.
The court held that ordinary principles of construction applied to rent review clauses and applied the principles in The Antaios (Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB) [1985] AC 191.
After quoting the passage from the speech of Lord Diplock cited above, Hoffmann LJ said, at p 98: This robust declaration does not, however, mean that one can rewrite the language which the parties have used in order to make the contract conform to business common sense.
But language is a very flexible instrument and, if it is capable of more than one construction, one chooses that which seems most likely to give effect to the commercial purpose of the agreement.
The court also comprised Leggatt and Simon Brown LJJ.
Simon Brown LJ at p 101 said that, having regard to the improbable result for which the landlords contended, only the most unambiguous of such clauses could properly be found to bear the landlords construction and that in the case of only one of the leases did the clause unambiguously achieve the improbable result for which the landlords contend.
The case is of interest because Simon Brown LJ considered that, of the other three cases, one unambiguously failed to achieve the result sought by the landlords, whereas, of the other two, he said this at p 102: For my part, I would accept that the more obvious reading of both favours the landlords construction.
I am persuaded, however, that they are capable of being, and therefore, for the reasons already given, should be, construed differently.
That case is therefore an example of the adoption and application of the principle endorsed by the Judge and by Sir Simon Tuckey.
See also International Fina Services AG v Katrina Shipping Ltd, The Fina Samco [1995] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 344, where Neill LJ said at page 350 it was necessary when construing a commercial document to strive to attribute to it a meaning which accords with business common sense.
In 1997, writing extra judicially (Contract Law: Fulfilling the reasonable expectations of honest men) in 113 LQR 433, 441 Lord Steyn expressed the principle thus: Often there is no obvious or ordinary meaning of the language under consideration.
There are competing interpretations to be considered.
In choosing between alternatives a court should primarily be guided by the contextual scene in which the stipulation in question appears.
And speaking generally commercially minded judges would regard the commercial purpose of the contract as more important than niceties of language.
And, in the event of doubt, the working assumption will be that a fair construction best matches the reasonable expectations of the parties.
I agree.
He said much the same judicially in Society of Lloyds v Robinson [1999] 1 All ER (Comm) 545, 551: Loyalty to the text of a commercial contract, instrument, or document read in its contextual setting is the paramount principle of interpretation.
But in the process of interpreting the meaning of the language of a commercial document the court ought generally to favour a commercially sensible construction.
The reason for this approach is that a commercial construction is likely to give effect to the intention of the parties.
Words ought therefore to be interpreted in the way in which a reasonable commercial person would construe them.
And the reasonable commercial person can safely be assumed to be unimpressed with technical interpretations and undue emphasis on niceties of language.
Similar assistance is at hand nearer at home.
In Gan Insurance Co Ltd v Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd [2001] CLC 1103, 1118 1119; [2011] EWCA Civ 1047; [2001] 2 All ER (Comm) 299, Mance LJ said: 13.
Construction, as Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in Arbuthnott v Fagan [1995] CLC 1396 at p 1400 is thus a composite exercise, neither uncompromisingly literal nor unswervingly purposive.
To para (5), one may add as a coda words of Lord Bridge in Mitsui Construction Co Ltd v A G of Hong Kong (1986) 33 BLR 14, cited in my judgment in Sinochem International Oil (London) Ltd v Mobil Sales and Supply Corp [2000] CLC 878 at p 885.
Speaking of a poorly drafted and ambiguous contract, Lord Bridge said that poor drafting itself provides: no reason to depart from the fundamental rule of construction of contractual documents that the intention of the parties must be ascertained from the language that they have used interpreted in the light of the relevant factual situation in which the contract was made.
But the poorer the quality of the drafting, the less willing the court should be to be driven by semantic niceties to attribute to the parties an improbable and unbusinesslike intention, if the language used, whatever it may lack in precision, is reasonably capable of an interpretation which attributes to the parties an intention to make provision for contingencies inherent in the work contracted for on a sensible and businesslike basis. 16 . in my judgment the subclause has no very natural meaning and is, at the least, open to two possible meanings or interpretations one the judge's, the other that it addresses two separate subject matters.
In these circumstances, it is especially important to undertake the exercise on which the judge declined to embark, that is to consider the implications of each interpretation.
In my opinion, a court when construing any document should always have an eye to the consequences of a particular construction, even if they often only serve as a check on an obvious meaning or a restraint upon adoption of a conceivable but unbusinesslike meaning.
In intermediate situations, as Professor Guest wisely observes in Chitty on Contracts (28th edn) vol 1, para. 12 049, a balance has to be struck through the exercise of sound judicial discretion.
More generally, in Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd: The Starsin [2004] 1 AC 715, para 10 Lord Bingham referred to the rule to which Lord Halsbury LC alluded in Glynn v Margetson & Co [1893] AC 351, 359, that a business sense will be given to business documents.
The business sense is that which businessmen, in the course of their ordinary dealings, would give the document.
Three other cases merit brief reference.
The same approach was adopted by Arden LJ in In the Matter of Golden Key Ltd (In Receivership) [2009] EWCA Civ 636, paras 29 and 42 and by this Court in In Re Sigma Finance Corporation (in administrative receivership) [2009] UKSC 2; [2010] 1 All ER 571, where Lord Mance said at para 12 that the resolution of an issue of interpretation in a case like the present was an iterative process, involving checking each of the rival meanings against other provisions of the document and investigating its commercial consequences.
Finally, it is worth setting out two extracts from the judgment of Longmore LJ in Barclays Bank plc v HHY Luxembourg SARL [2010] EWCA Civ 1248; [2011] 1 BCLC 336, paras 25 and 26: 25.
The matter does not of course rest there because when alternative constructions are available one has to consider which is the more commercially sensible.
On this aspect of the matter Mr Zacaroli has all the cards. 26.
The judge said that it did not flout common sense to say that the clause provided for a very limited level of release, but that, with respect, is not quite the way to look at the matter.
If a clause is capable of two meanings, as on any view this clause is, it is quite possible that neither meaning will flout common sense.
In such circumstances, it is much more appropriate to adopt the more, rather than the less, commercial construction.
In my opinion Longmore LJ has there neatly summarised the correct approach to the problem.
That approach is now supported by a significant body of authority.
As stated in a little more detail in para 21 above, it is in essence that, where a term of a contract is open to more than one interpretation, it is generally appropriate to adopt the interpretation which is most consistent with business common sense.
For these reasons I prefer the approach of the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey to that of Patten LJ, which is to my mind significantly different on this point.
Application to the facts
As indicated above, two possible interpretations of paragraph [3] of the Bonds were advanced.
It was conceded on behalf of the Bank in the Court of Appeal that both constructions were arguable.
I did not understand Mr Guy Philipps QC to resile from that position on behalf of the Bank in this Court.
In any event, in my judgment there are indeed two possible interpretations.
The strength of the Banks interpretation is that it is not easy to see the point of paragraph [2] of the Bonds if the Buyers interpretation of paragraph [3] is correct.
On the other hand, the Buyers interpretation is straightforward.
It is that, reduced to its essentials, the Banks promise in paragraph [3] was that in consideration of your [ie the Buyers] agreement to make the pre delivery instalments we hereby, as primary obligor, promise to pay to you, your successors and assigns, on your first written demand, all such sums due to you under the Contract .
In the absence of paragraph [2] there could be no doubt that the reference to such sums was a reference to the pre delivery instalments at the beginning of paragraph [3].
That makes perfect sense because one would naturally expect the parties to agree (and the Buyers financiers to insist) that, in the event, for example, of the insolvency of the Builders, the Buyers should have security for the repayment of the pre delivery instalments which they had paid.
The question is whether the presence of paragraph [2] leads to a different conclusion.
It was submitted with force by Mr Philipps on behalf of the Bank that it did.
He correctly submitted that paragraph [3] must be construed in its context and that part of the context was paragraph [2], which was of course the immediately preceding paragraph.
He submitted that the only purpose there can have been for including paragraph [2] in the Bonds was to identify the scope of paragraph [3].
He further submitted that no other sensible explanation for the inclusion of paragraph [2] had been advanced on behalf of the Buyers.
I accept the submission that no very good reason was advanced on behalf of the Buyers for the inclusion of paragraph [2] in the Bonds.
The best they could do was to say that it was a preamble to the operative provision in paragraph [3], that it simply set out some of the Buyers rights under the Contracts and that it was not intended to identify the scope of the Banks liability under the Bonds.
Patten LJ accepted at para 50 that the Buyers construction was arguable but said that, in his view, it was not the meaning that the document would convey to a reasonable person reading it with knowledge of the terms of the Contracts.
This must I think mean that he took the view that, although it was arguable that it had that effect, it did not in fact do so.
Otherwise the Buyers construction could not in any relevant sense have been said to be arguable and Patten LJ would surely not have described it as such.
Patten LJ made this clear in para 51 (quoted below), where he described the alternative constructions as not being in any way evenly balanced.
The position is thus that, although he regarded both constructions as arguable in the sense that the Bonds might convey either construction to a reasonable person reading the Bonds with knowledge of the terms of the Contracts, in his view the Banks construction was plainly to be preferred.
If Patten LJ went further later in para 51, where he said that the fact that cover for the insolvency of the Builder was desirable did not justify a departure from what would otherwise be the natural and obvious construction of the bond, I respectfully disagree because I do not regard the Banks construction as being the natural and ordinary meaning of the Bonds.
I have considered the competing arguments for myself and have concluded that they are much more finely balanced than suggested by Patten LJ and the Bank.
In para 48 Patten LJ expressed the view that paragraph [2] of the Bonds reproduced the terms of Article X.5 and Article X.6 of the Contracts and therefore complied with Article X.8.
In para 49 he concluded that the obvious purpose of paragraph [2] was to give the addressee of the Bonds a clear statement of the Builders obligations under the Contracts which are to be covered by the guarantee and one which is consistent with the terms of the Builders obligations to provide the bond under Article X.8 of the contract.
For my part, I would not entirely accept that analysis.
Paragraph [2] of the Bonds did reproduce the terms of Article X.5 and Article X.6 of the Contracts but it does not seem to me that it complied with the requirements of Article X.8.
As I see it, Article X.8 did not provide for the terms in which the Bonds were to be issued.
It provided that two letters of guarantee were to be provided, the first by a first class Korean Bank or Guarantee Insurance Company for the refund of the first instalment and the second issued by a first class Korean Bank or Guarantee Insurance Company acceptable to the Buyers financiers for the refund of the respective installments following the way of the payment stipulated in this Article.
The first paragraph of Article X.8 included this: The refund guarantees by the Builder to the Buyer shall be indicated pre delivery instalments plus interest as aforesaid to the Buyer under or pursuant to paragraph 5 above in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A which is yet to be agreed.
In fact there was no form annexed to the Contracts, so it is far from clear what was meant by the sentence of the first paragraph of Article X.8 just quoted.
As I see it, it was left that the parties would agree the final form of the Bonds referable to the second and subsequent instalments.
Moreover both the identity of the issuer of the Bonds and the form of the Bonds were to be acceptable to the Buyers financiers.
That was made clear by the second paragraph of Article X.8 which is quoted in para 11 above.
I would accept the submission made on behalf of the Buyers that it is clear that neither Article X.5 nor Article X.8 was intended to set out all the circumstances in which the refund guarantees should operate.
For example, there was no cross reference in Article X.8 to the Builders obligation under Article X.6 of the Contracts to refund the instalments paid in the event of actual or constructive total loss, although it is common ground that the Bonds did cover that obligation.
In short, Article X.8 did not purport to dictate the final scope of the Bonds.
In particular, it did not require that the guarantees should cover refund obligations only under Article X.5 and Article X.6 of the Contracts.
There is a further curiosity in paragraph [2] of the Bonds.
In describing the Buyers rights under the Contracts, it did not limit their rights to a refund of the pre delivery instalments of the price.
It extended them to the case where the Buyers were entitled to the value of the Buyers Supplies delivered to the Shipyard (if any), although in so doing it failed accurately to reflect the contractual position in relation to termination as opposed to total loss, since under Article X.5 of the Contracts the obligation on termination was to return the Supplies, and only to (re)pay their value insofar as already incorporated into the Vessel.
It would seem to follow from the Banks submission that para [2] defined the scope of the Banks obligations under para [3] that the expression all such sums due to you under the Contract included both the obligations to refund identified in para [2] and the obligation to pay the value of the Buyers Supplies (whatever that might cover).
That was indeed the submission advanced in the Banks skeleton argument in the Court of Appeal.
It is however a submission that is no longer advanced by either party.
That is no doubt because the difficulty with it is that the Bonds were described as Advance Payment Bonds and the amount of each bond was US$26,640,000, which was the total amount of the second and subsequent instalments of the price, and because interest was only payable under para [3] of the Bonds from the respective dates of payment by [the Buyers] of such instalments, thus leaving no room for a right to payment of the value of Buyers Supplies under the Bonds.
Sir Simon Tuckey took a different view of the construction of the critical clauses of the Bonds from that of Patten and Thorpe LJJ.
He did so in para 28, where he was considering whether in the particular circumstances of the case the Judge should have had regard to considerations of commercial and business common sense.
He said this: But should the judge's approach in this case have been more restricted as Mr Philipps contends? I do not think so.
The title to Article X as a whole is ""Payment"" but it contains an assortment of different terms.
Article X.8 is drafted on the basis that the form of guarantee which the parties contemplated would be annexed to the agreement.
That would be the document to look at if one was trying to discover from the contract what the Buyer was looking for, not the reference back to Article X.5.
This reference back is poorly drafted and quite capable of referring simply to the opening sentence of paragraph 5.
It is difficult to construe it in a way which restricts the refund obligations which the bond was to cover, not least because there is no reference to the Article X.6 obligation to a refund following total or constructive loss of the vessel which both parties agree was to be covered by the bond.
By the same token, no significance should be attached to the omission of the Article XII.3 refund obligation.
Nor do I think there is anything in Mr Philipps' further point.
On the happening of an Article XII.3 event the Buyer was entitled to a refund of its advance payments immediately.
If that did not happen the contract was in a state of limbo: neither party could terminate at that stage.
If the Builder did not proceed with the construction of the vessel, as would be extremely likely if it was insolvent, the Buyer could terminate for delay under Article XII.l but, under the terms of this article, only after 90 days plus 14 days notice.
Only then could it call on the Bond.
I cannot see how any Buyer (or its financiers) could possibly be satisfied with this as a remedy in the situation where the Builder was insolvent or nearly so.
I agree with Sir Simon Tuckey and prefer his approach to that of the majority in the Court of Appeal.
In all these circumstances, because of the difficulties in construing para [2] as setting out the sums due under the Bond, if I were focusing only on the language of the clause, I would be inclined to prefer the Buyers construction to that of the Bank.
I note in passing in this regard that the construction advanced by the Bank was something of an afterthought.
However, I recognize that, on the Buyers construction, it is not easy to see why paragraph [2] was included in the Bond at all, and that the Banks construction is arguable.
This case is therefore a good example of the kind of case referred to in the authorities to which I have referred.
Since the language of paragraph [3] is capable of two meanings it is appropriate for the court to have regard to considerations of commercial common sense in resolving the question what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant.
As noted at para 17 above, at his para 18(iii) the Judge described the Banks construction of the Bonds as having what he called the surprising and uncommercial result that the Buyers would not be able to call on the Bonds on the happening of the event, namely insolvency of the Builder, which would be most likely to require the first class security.
I agree with Sir Simon Tuckey that an appellate court is entitled to take account of the fact that an experienced judge of the Commercial Court reached that conclusion.
In any event, Sir Simon Tuckey expressed essentially the same view in strong terms at para 30: On the Bank's construction the Bonds covered each of the situations in which the Buyers were entitled to a return or refund of the advance payments which they had made under the contracts apart from the insolvency of the Builder.
No credible commercial reason has been advanced as to why the parties (or the Buyers' financiers) should have agreed to this.
On the contrary, it makes no commercial sense.
As the judge said, insolvency of the Builder was the situation for which the security of an advance payment bond was most likely to be needed.
The importance attached in these contracts to the obligation to refund in the event of insolvency can be seen from the fact that they required the refund to be made immediately.
It defies commercial common sense to think that this, among all other such obligations, was the only one which the parties intended should not be secured.
Had the parties intended this surprising result I would have expected the contracts and the bonds to have spelt this out clearly but they do not do so.
I agree.
Patten LJs view to the contrary is summarised at para 51: For the reasons which I have given, I do not regard the alternative constructions of paragraph (3) advanced on this appeal as being in any way evenly balanced.
I also agree with Mr Philipps that it is impermissible to speculate on the reasons for omitting repayments in the event of insolvency from the bond.
Although the judge is right to say that cover for such event was, objectively speaking, desirable, that is not sufficient in itself to justify a departure from what would otherwise be the natural and obvious construction of the bond.
There may be any number of reasons why the Builder was unable or unwilling to provide bank cover in the event of its insolvency and why the Buyer was prepared to take the risk.
This is not a case in which the construction contended for would produce an absurd or irrational result in the sense described in the cases I have referred to and merely to say that no credible commercial reason has been advanced for the limited scope of the bond does, in my view, put us in real danger of substituting our own judgment of the commerciality of the transaction for that of those who were actually party to it.
As Hoffmann LJ put it, after quoting from Lord Diplocks speech in The Antaios [1985] AC 191, if the language is capable of more than one construction, it is not necessary to conclude that a particular construction would produce an absurd or irrational result before having regard to the commercial purpose of the agreement.
See, for example, per Hoffmann LJ quoted at para 23 above, where he said: But language is a very flexible instrument and, if it is capable of more than one construction, one chooses that which seems most likely to give effect to the commercial purpose of the agreement.
See also the quotation from Longmore LJ at para 29 above, where he said that, if a clause is capable of two meanings, it is quite possible that neither meaning will flout common sense, but that, in such a case, it is much more appropriate to adopt the more, rather than the less, commercial construction.
In para 51 Patten LJ appears to have accepted that no credible commercial reasons were advanced for the limited scope of the Bonds being advanced by the Bank.
Mr Philipps submitted that it was not necessary for the Bank to address the question but I have no doubt that if he or the Bank had been able to think of a credible reason for excluding repayments in the event of the Builders insolvency, such a reason would have been at the forefront of the Banks case.
In these circumstances I would, if necessary, go so far as to say that the omission of the obligation to make such re payments from the Bonds would flout common sense but it is not necessary to go so far.
I agree with the Judge and Sir Simon Tuckey that, of the two arguable constructions of paragraph [3] of the Bonds, the Buyers construction is to be preferred because it is consistent with the commercial purpose of the Bonds in a way in which the Banks construction is not.
I note that Thorpe LJ was initially inclined to agree with the conclusions of the Judge but, in the event, agreed with Patten LJ without giving any independent reasons of his own.
CONCLUSION
For these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the Judge.
","This case concerns the correct construction of refund guarantees issued by the Respondent bank in relation to six shipbuilding contracts.
In May 2007 the first to sixth claimants (the Buyers) entered into shipbuilding contracts (the Contracts) with Jinse Shipbuilding Co Ltd (the Builder).
Under the Contracts the Builder agreed to build and sell one vessel to each of the six Buyers.
The price of each vessel was US$33.3m, which was to be paid in five equal instalments.
Article X.8 of the Contracts stated that payment of the first instalment was conditional upon the Builder providing the Buyer with a satisfactory refund guarantee from a first class Korean bank.
Article X.5 gave the Buyer a right to a full refund in the event that the Buyer exercised their right to reject the vessel or to terminate, cancel or rescind the Contract.
Article XII.3 of the Contracts then gave the Buyers further rights to repayment of instalments paid in the event of a default by the Builder.
In particular, Article XII.3 stated that if the Builder became subject to certain insolvency proceedings, the Buyer may by notice in writing to the Builder require the Builder to refund immediately to the Buyer the full amount of all sums paid by the Buyer to the Builder.
As envisaged by Article X.8 of the Contracts, in August 2007 the Respondent bank issued each of the Buyers with materially identical Advanced Payment Bonds (the Bonds).
Paragraph 2 of the Bonds stated that, under the terms of the Buyers Contract with the Builder, the Buyer was entitled to a refund in the event that they exercised their right to reject the vessel or to terminate, cancel or rescind the Contract.
The Respondents guarantee obligation was then set out in paragraph 3, which stated that the Respondent promised to pay the Buyer all such sums due to you under the Contract.
The first line of paragraph 3 explained that this promise was given [i]n consideration of your agreement to make the pre delivery instalments under the Contract.
Paragraph 4 stated that payment would be made upon receipt of a written demand from the Buyer stating that the Builder had failed to fulfil the terms of the Contract and specifying the amount claimed.
Paragraph 5(v) stated that the Respondents liability under the Bonds would not be affected by any insolvency, re organisation or dissolution of the Builder.
Each of the Buyers duly paid the first instalment of US$6.66m due under the Contracts.
One of the Buyers also subsequently paid a second instalment in the same amount.
In 2008 the Builder experienced financial difficulties and in January 2009 it became subject to a formal debt workout procedure under the Korean Corporate Restructuring Promotion Law 2007.
In April 2009 the Buyers wrote to the Respondent demanding repayment under the Bonds of the instalments that had been paid to the Builder under the Contracts.
The Respondent rejected the Buyers demands on the basis that, on the true construction of the Bonds, the Respondent had not undertaken to guarantee payment of refunds arising under Article XII.3 of the Contracts.
In the High Court the judge ruled in favour of the Buyers construction of the Bonds and entered summary judgment against the Respondent.
On appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal (Thorpe
and Patten LJJ) overturned the High Courts ruling and entered summary judgment in favour of the Respondent.
Sir Simon Tuckey gave a dissenting judgment in which he explained his reasons for preferring the High Court judges construction of the Bonds.
The Supreme Court granted the Appellants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the order of the High Court.
Lord Clarke gives the sole judgment, with which Lords Phillips, Mance, Kerr and Wilson agree.
The issue at the heart of this appeal is whether, on the true construction of paragraph 3 of the Bonds, the Buyers are entitled to payment from the Respondent in respect of refunds that they are entitled to from the Builder under Article XII.3 of the Contracts [6].
It was common ground that everything depends upon the true construction of the Bonds and that the terms and meaning of the Contracts are only relevant to the extent that they inform the true construction of the Bonds [7],[10].
Under paragraph 3 of the Bonds the Respondent promised to pay the Buyers all such sums due to you under the Contract.
The question is therefore what was meant by such sums.
On this point, neither Article X.5 nor Article X.8 was intended to set out all the circumstances in which the refund guarantee should operate [37].
The Buyers said that the expression covered the pre delivery instalments referred to in the first line of paragraph 3 in other words, the phrase referred to all pre delivery instalments paid by the Buyers.
The Respondent, on the other hand, contended that the expression such sums was limited to the sums that were referred to in paragraph 2 of the Bonds.
Since paragraph 2 did not include any reference to the Buyers rights under Article XII.3 of the Contracts to repayment upon the Builders insolvency, the Respondent was under no obligation to make any payment to the Buyers in the present case.
On the face of it, the correct approach to the construction of the Bonds is not in dispute.
The cases show that the ultimate aim of interpreting a provision in a contract, especially a commercial contract, is to determine what the parties meant by the language used.
This process involves ascertaining what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant.
A reasonable person, for these purposes, is one who has all the background knowledge that would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract [14].
The issue between the parties is the role to be played by considerations of business common sense in determining what the parties meant [15].
Where the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply it [23].
However if there are two possible constructions, it is generally appropriate to adopt the interpretation that is most consistent with business common sense and to reject the other [21], [29].
It is not necessary to conclude that a particular construction would produce an absurd or irrational result before proceeding to have regard to the commercial purpose of the agreement [43].
In the present case, since the language of paragraph 3 is capable of two meanings, it is appropriate for the court to have regard to considerations of commercial commonsense [40].
Although the Buyers are unable to provide any very good reason why paragraph 2 was included in the Bonds [34], a construction of paragraph 3 which excluded the Builders insolvency from the situations that trigger the Respondents obligation to refund advance payments made by the Buyers would make no commercial sense [41].
Accordingly, of the two arguable constructions of paragraph 3 of the Bonds, the Buyers construction is to be preferred because it is consistent with the commercial purpose of the Bonds in a way that the Respondents construction is not [45].
"
uksc-2017-0075,"The Home Secretary determines to exercise his power to remove a foreign national from the UK.
The foreign national contends that the determination is unlawful on the ground that her removal would violate her right to respect for her private life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the 1998 Act).
Section 117B(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) provides that little weight should be given to a private life which she established at a time when her immigration status was precarious.
What does the word precarious mean in this context? This is the primary question posed by the present appeal.
Introduction
The foreign national is Ms Rhuppiah.
On 22 August 2014, in the First tier Tribunal, First tier Tribunal Judge Blundell (to whom I will refer as Judge Blundell) reluctantly dismissed her challenge under article 8 to the Home Secretarys determination, dated 6 June 2013, to remove her from the UK.
Judge Blundell concluded that her private life in the UK had been established at a time when her immigration status had been precarious within the meaning of section 117B(5), which had come into force less than a month earlier; and he considered himself in effect bound by the subsection to dismiss her appeal against the determination.
Her further appeals to the Upper Tribunal and then to the Court of Appeal both failed.
By its decision dated 2 August 2016, [2016] EWCA Civ 803, [2016] 1 WLR 4203, the Court of Appeal (Sales LJ, who gave the substantive judgment, and Moore Bick LJ and Sir Stephen Richards, who agreed with it) upheld Judge Blundells conclusion that the establishment of Ms Rhuppiahs private life in the UK had occurred at a time when her immigration status had been precarious.
Now she appeals against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
Within the well known structure of article 8, the primary question arises as part of the inquiry into whether the proposed interference with Ms Rhuppiahs private life in the UK is proportionate.
Therefore, in determining this appeal, this court, like the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal, must ask itself whether Judge Blundell was wrong to hold that at the relevant time her immigration status had been precarious: see the judgment of Lord Carnwath in R (R) v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police [2018] UKSC 47, [2018] 1 WLR 4079, paras 53 to 64.
As it happens, Ms Rhuppiahs appeal has recently become academic.
This occurred on 9 February 2018; and explanation of it requires reference to the Immigration Rules HC 395 (the rules).
The Home Secretary has set out in the rules, indorsed by Parliament, the provisions which, in his opinion reflective of his policy, should in principle govern his determination of claims to resist removal from the UK on the part of those in breach of immigration laws by reference to their right to respect for their private or family life under article 8.
He recognises, however, that his obligation under section 6 of the 1998 Act, like that of a court hearing an appeal against his determination when based on article 8, is to act compatibly with rights under article 8 and that such compatibility may not always coincide with compatibility with his rules.
So, like the courts, the Home Secretary has to allow for the possibility that a person may be entitled to resist removal under article 8 even when he or she cannot do so under the rules.
But article 8 itself, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights (the ECtHR), confers upon the relevant policy maker, who in the UK is the Home Secretary, a limited discretion in relation to the determination of claims made under it.
So, when a person claims to resist removal by reference to article 8 outside the rules, the Home Secretary is entitled, and a court hearing an appeal against his determination is required, to weigh in the balance against the claim the fact that it could not have succeeded under the rules: see the judgment of Lord Reed in R (Agyarko) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11, [2017] 1 WLR 823, at paras 46 and 47.
In these proceedings Ms Rhuppiah has been resisting removal by reference to article 8 outside the rules.
What happened on 9 February 2018 was that the Home Secretary decided that she had recently become able to resist removal by reference to article 8 under the rules.
As I will explain, Ms Rhuppiah entered the UK on 16 September 1997 and has lived here continuously ever since.
Paragraph 276ADE(1) of the rules specifies the requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain in the UK on the ground of private life in the UK; and they include, at (iii), that he or she has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years.
It follows that on 16 September 2017 Ms Rhuppiah began to satisfy the requirement at (iii); she also satisfied the other requirements.
Paragraph 276BE(1) provides that, if the requirements of para 276ADE(1) are satisfied, the Home Secretary may grant leave to remain in the UK for up to 30 months; and para 276DE provides that, if an applicant has remained in the UK with continuous leave on the ground of private life for at least ten years, he or she may be granted indefinite leave to remain.
Thus it was that by letter dated 9 February 2018, the heading of which referred to Private Life Rules, the Home Secretary (to whom, for convenience, I will throughout refer as male) informed Ms Rhuppiah that he had granted her leave to remain in the UK for 30 months; that she could apply for further limited leave prior to the end of that period; and that, in the event that she were to complete at least ten years of continuous residence pursuant to leave to remain on the ground of her private life, she might then be eligible for a grant of indefinite leave to remain in the UK.
The result is that the Home Secretary then granted to Ms Rhuppiah all that she could have hoped to achieve in the present proceedings.
Thought then turned to the utility of any further prosecution of the present appeal.
In the event the court agreed with the parties that the appeal should proceed.
The court agreed that it was of general importance for it to offer a definitive interpretation of the word precarious in section 117B(5) of the 2002 Act.
It is also now clear, as both parties agree, that in any event the First tier Tribunal (and indeed the Court of Appeal) fell into error in a different respect and that, irrespective of whether it was material, the error requires to be rectified: see paras 51 to 57 below.
So the appeal has proceeded.
Were this court to conclude that the First tier Tribunal had been wrong in a material respect to dismiss Ms Rhuppiahs appeal against the Home Secretarys determination dated 6 June 2013, it would allow her appeal in the normal way and set aside the tribunals order.
That would render Ms Rhuppiahs appeal against it undecided.
But there is now no need for it to be decided.
So the court would not remit it to the tribunal for fresh determination.
The Facts
The relevant facts can be taken from a determination of conspicuous clarity and sensitivity made by Judge Blundell following a substantial oral hearing.
Ms Rhuppiah is a Tanzanian national, now aged 45.
She lived in Tanzania until 1997, when she entered the UK with leave to reside here as a student for three months.
Her mother and one of her brothers still reside in Tanzania.
Her father works for the UN in Sudan and regularly sends money to the UK for her support.
Her other brother lives in Basingstoke; and he has a daughter, aged nine, with whom she is on close terms.
There would, however, be no significant obstacle to the re integration of Ms Rhuppiah into society in Tanzania.
The Home Secretary granted further leave to Ms Rhuppiah to reside in the UK as a student on no less than 12 occasions.
The final grant expired on 30 November 2009.
But six of these further grants were made pursuant to applications made after the previous leave had expired.
Responsibility for the delay usually lay with the college to which Ms Rhuppiah had entrusted the task of making the applications on her behalf.
In making her applications for further leave to reside in the UK as a student, Ms Rhuppiah was required to demonstrate an intention to leave the UK at the end of her studies.
On each occasion she did so to the satisfaction of the Home Secretary.
In cross examination before the tribunal she accepted that she always expected to be required to leave the UK at some point.
As a result of her extensive studies in the UK, Ms Rhuppiah, who speaks English fluently, gained a variety of qualifications in business studies and associated fields.
In November 2009, at the time of the expiry of the final grant of leave, Ms Rhuppiah applied for indefinite leave to remain in the UK on the ground of continuous lawful residence in the UK for at least ten years pursuant to what was then para 276B(i)(a) of the rules.
The trouble was that her continuous residence had not always been lawful.
The Home Secretary refused her application and the First tier Tribunal dismissed her appeal against the refusal.
When, on 11 October 2010, the Upper Tribunal refused to grant her leave to appeal against the dismissal, Ms Rhuppiah became an unlawful overstayer in the UK.
Judge Blundell observed that, had it not been for the ineptitude of her college in failing to make timely applications for further leave on her behalf, her application for indefinite leave to remain would probably have succeeded.
Ms Rhuppiahs next attempt to apply for indefinite leave to remain in the UK met further ill fortune.
On 1 July 2012 she applied on the ground of continuous residence in the UK (whether or not lawful) for at least 14 years pursuant to what was then para 276B(i)(b) of the rules.
But she applied on the wrong form and enclosed an insufficient fee.
So on 12 July her application was returned to her.
On 24 July she re applied.
But by then, namely on 9 July, the rules had been amended so as to delete para 276B(i)(b) (Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 194).
Judge Blundell observed that Ms Rhuppiah was justified in feeling cheated but he correctly held that a near miss was irrelevant.
He cited Patel v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 72, [2014] AC 651, in which, at para 53, Lord Carnwath cited with approval an observation that a miss was as good as a mile.
When, belatedly, the Home Secretary addressed Ms Rhuppiahs re application dated 24 July 2012, he inevitably determined that it could not succeed under the rules.
He proceeded to consider whether it should succeed on a basis outside the rules, by reference to her right to respect for her private life under article 8.
His determination on that basis was also negative; and such has been the basis on which in these proceedings she has challenged the lawfulness of his determination to remove her from the UK.
There is a striking feature of the private life established by Ms Rhuppiah in the UK.
It concerns her friendship with Ms Charles.
She lives in the home of Ms Charles, which is, or was at the time of their oral evidence to Judge Blundell, in London.
Ms Charles is highly qualified in the field of IT and works as a systems engineer for Ministry of Defence projects and often in Bristol.
Ms Rhuppiah met Ms Charles when they were studying at the same college and they have resided together since 2001.
But it is not suggested and there is no need to consider whether it might have been suggested that Ms Rhuppiah pursues family life with Ms Charles within the meaning of article 8.
Ms Charles suffers from ulcerative colitis, a gravely debilitating condition.
She suffers frequent symptoms of diarrhoea, nausea, inability to eat, anaemia, fatigue, joint pain and reduced mobility.
She has had multiple admissions to hospital.
She is heavily dependent on Ms Rhuppiah both physically and emotionally.
Ms Rhuppiah cooks such food as Ms Charles can eat and accompanies her to Bristol, to hospital and in effect everywhere.
Ms Charles has ceded control of her financial affairs to her.
Instead of paying her for looking after her in these respects, Ms Charles provides her with largely free board and lodging.
Judge Blundell found that Ms Rhuppiah, who is a Seventh Day Adventist, cares for Ms Charles out of friendship, faith and habit.
He found that, were Ms Rhuppiah to leave the UK, Ms Charles would have to turn to the state to meet her need for care; that her physical health and her ability to continue to work in Bristol would be compromised, at least in the short term; and that her life would be turned upside down.
Sections 117A and 117B
Section 117B(5) falls within Part 5A of the 2002 Act, which was inserted into it, with effect from 28 July 2014, by section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014.
Part 5A is headed Article 8 of the ECHR: Public Interest Considerations.
Unfortunately it is necessary to set out a substantial amount of Part 5A, as follows: 117A Application of this Part (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required to determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts (a) breaches a persons right to respect for private and family life under article 8, and as a result would be unlawful under (b) section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
In considering the public interest question, the (2) court or tribunal must (in particular) have regard in all cases, to the considerations listed in (a) section 117B In subsection (2), the public interest question (3) means the question of whether an interference with a persons right to respect for private and family life is justified under article 8(2). 117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest.
It is in the public interest, and in particular in the (2) interests of the economic well being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons who can speak English are less of a burden on taxpayers, and (a) (b) are better able to integrate into society. (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic well being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent, because such persons (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into society. (4) Little weight should be given to a private life, or a relationship formed with a qualifying (a) (b) partner, that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully. (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a person at a time when the persons immigration status is precarious. (6)
It will be seen that the considerations in each of the first five subsections of section 117B are all entitled public interest considerations.
On any view the considerations in the first three subsections relate to the public interest in the removal of a person present in the UK contrary to immigration law.
At first sight, however, one might consider that the considerations in the fourth and fifth subsections relate to the strength of the case which might weigh against that public interest.
The explanation for their inclusion as public interest considerations lies in the wide definition of the public interest question set out in section 117A(3) above.
See Deelah (section 117B ambit) [2015] UKUT 00515 (IAC), paras 18 and 21.
Section 117B(4) is not engaged in the present case: it is agreed that Ms Rhuppiah established her relevant private life in the UK, in particular her role in caring for Ms Charles, long before 2010 and at a time when her presence here was predominantly lawful.
Nevertheless it may be helpful to note the reference to a qualifying partner in section 117B(4)(b) and to glance at the definition of that phrase in section 117D(1).
It means a partner who is a British citizen or who is settled in the United Kingdom (within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971 see section 33(2A) of that Act).
Section 33(2A) defines a person as settled in the UK if he is ordinarily resident there without being subject under the immigration laws to any restriction on the period for which he may remain.
Insofar as the courts inquiry into the meaning of a precarious status in section 117B(5) may be seen in what follows to require contrast with the meaning of a settled status, it may be helpful to bear in mind the definition of the word settled brought by section 117D(1) into the 2002 Act itself.
At last this judgment can proceed to address the primary question, namely the meaning of the word precarious in section 117B(5).
Section 117B(5)
Ms Rhuppiah accepts that a persons immigration status in the UK can be precarious when he or she is lawfully present in the UK; otherwise subsection (5) of section 117B would add nothing to subsection (4).
She suggests that, for example, asylum seekers pending determination of their applications and lawful visitors to the UK probably have a precarious immigration status.
But she contrasts their situation with that of persons who, albeit with a right to remain which is time limited, have a reasonable hope of permanent settlement in the UK or who (as is suggested by Richard Warren, Private life in the balance: constructing the precarious migrant, Journal of Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Law (2016) 124, 130) are on a potential path to settlement.
She contends that, with the grant to her of long periods of leave to reside as a student, she fell into the latter category.
Hope that circumstances might change to enable her to continue to live in the UK did not, says Ms Rhuppiah, invalidate her intention, when seeking extensions of her visa, to depart from the UK at the end of her studies.
That a potential path to settlement was open to her is, she contends, made clear by the fact that she came close to securing it both in 2010 and in 2012.
The Court of Appeal rejected Ms Rhuppiahs argument, along the lines of the above, that her immigration status prior to 2010 was not precarious.
But, when it turned to the Home Secretarys contrary argument, which was and is that all leave short of indefinite leave to remain in the UK gives rise to a precarious status, the court expressed provisional doubt.
Sales LJ said at para 44: There is a very wide range of cases in which some form of leave to remain short of ILR may have been granted, and the word precarious seems to me to convey a more evaluative concept, the opposite of the idea that a person could be regarded as a settled migrant for article 8 purposes, which is to be applied having regard to the overall circumstances in which an immigrant finds himself in the host country.
Some immigrants with leave to remain falling short of ILR could be regarded as being very settled indeed and as having an immigration status which is not properly to be described as precarious.
Such being the parameters of the issue surrounding the primary question, we must seek guidance in authority, first that of the ECtHR.
It was in its admissibility decision in Mitchell v United Kingdom, (Application No 40447/98) 24 November 1998, that the ECtHR appears first to have used the word precarious in the context of an application under article 8.
It rejected, as manifestly ill founded, a British citizens application that her husbands deportation to Jamaica had violated her right to respect for her family life.
Her husband had been admitted to the UK as a visitor for six months; and for the following five years, in the course of which the applicant had married him, he had remained in the UK unlawfully.
The court said, at p 4: An important though not decisive consideration will also be whether the marriage was contracted at a time when the parties were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of the marriage within the host state would from the outset be precarious.
The court considers that where this is a relevant consideration it is likely only to be in the most exceptional circumstances that the removal of the
non national spouse will constitute a violation of article 8
In its numerous subsequent reiterations of the consideration identified in the Mitchell case the ECtHR has adapted it so as to extend to cases in which the context of the alleged family life was not a marriage.
So the question became whether family life was created at a time when the parties were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of family life within the host state would from the outset be precarious: see, for example, Rodrigues da Silva, Hoogkamer v Netherlands (2007) 44 EHRR 34, para 39.
In that case a mother and her young daughter relied on their family life together.
At all times the mothers stay in the Netherlands had been unlawful and she had given birth to the daughter there.
It is implicit in the courts judgment that the persistence of their family life in the Netherlands was therefore known to be precarious and that it was only by virtue of exceptional circumstances that the court held article 8 to have been violated.
In what circumstances beyond those in which a participant in the family life was known to be present in the state unlawfully, would its persistence there be precarious?
61292/00) 11 April 2006, the ECtHR said, at p 9: In its admissibility decision in Useinov v Netherlands (Application No it is the applicants submission that he was allowed to live in the Netherlands pending the proceedings on his asylum application and his subsequent application for a residence permit for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature, ie a total period of just over five years.
However, the court is of the view that this cannot be equated with lawful stay where the authorities explicitly grant an alien permission to settle in their country.
Therefore, the applicants stay in the Netherlands was precarious for most of it, and illegal for the remainder.
The court proceeded to hold, in apparent reference to the discussion in the Mitchell case, that there were no exceptional circumstances giving rise to a violation.
The final sentence of the above passage in the Useinov case presents a slight complication in that it pitches the word precarious into a slightly different context from that in which it had been placed in the Mitchell case, from which the court had just quoted.
For in the final sentence the court analysed whether the applicants stay had been precarious, not whether the persistence of family life there had been known to be precarious.
In that slightly different context it distinguished between a precarious stay, permitted by the state but only pending its determination of outstanding applications, and an illegal stay.
Had the court instead asked whether the persistence of family life had been known to be precarious, it would surely have answered affirmatively in relation both to the precarious and to the illegal periods of the applicants stay.
The more useful part of the above passage is in the distinction drawn between permission to stay pending determination of applications, which makes persistence of family life during that period precarious, and permission to settle, which (by implication) does not do so.
The distinction was reaffirmed in Nnyanzi v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 18, para 76.
The case of Butt v Norway (Application No 47017/09) 4 December 2012, sheds further light on the circumstances in which the persistence of family life would be precarious.
The family life of the applicant siblings in Norway had been created at a time when, with their mother, they had been granted a settlement permit which was later withdrawn because the mother had obtained it by the provision of false information.
The court held at para 79 that, to the mothers knowledge, the persistence of their family life was precarious but at para 90 that there were exceptional circumstances which gave rise to a violation.
But the most helpful decision of the ECtHR on this topic is that of the Grand Chamber in Jeunesse v Netherlands (2015) 60 EHRR 17.
The applicants husband and their three children were Dutch nationals.
But her family life with them in Holland was created at a time when, as a national of Suriname, her right to reside in Holland was no more than tolerated by the state pending its protracted determination of her various applications for residence permits and of her consequential appeals.
The court held that, to her knowledge, the persistence of their family life there was precarious.
In para 102 it echoed the contrast drawn in the Useinov and Nnyanzi cases with a grant of permission to settle.
In para 104 it proceeded as follows: The instant case may be distinguished from cases concerning settled migrants as this notion has been used in the courts case law, namely, persons who have already been granted formally a right of residence in a host country.
A subsequent withdrawal of that right, for instance because the person concerned has been convicted of a criminal offence, will constitute an interference with his or her right to respect for private and/or family life The significance of the passage mainly lies in the word withdrawal, which sheds light on the nature of the right of residence which the Grand Chamber had in mind.
For, as Sales LJ himself suggested in para 39 of his judgment, a right of residence which can be withdrawn, for instance because of a criminal conviction, is, in particular, a right of residence pursuant to indefinite leave to remain.
In relation to applications under article 8 arising prior to the introduction of section 117B(5), both the Home Secretary, in his Instructions to case workers, and the courts of England and Wales duly sought to take into account the consideration identified by the ECtHR in the Mitchell case and later adapted.
For example in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) Sales J rejected the applicants challenge to the lawfulness of a determination to remove him to India on the basis that persistence of his family life in the UK with his cohabitant had from the outset been precarious.
In fact at all material times the applicant had been in the UK unlawfully; so the basis for the judges decision was obvious and he was not required precisely to discern the boundary between when persistence of family life was and was not precarious.
In the Agyarko case, cited in para 4 above, the appellants had also formed the relevant relationships while they had been unlawfully in the UK.
But it is worthwhile to note the way in which Lord Reed expressed himself in a judgment with which the other members of the court agreed.
Having in para 49 addressed the Jeunesse case, he suggested in para 51 (and in effect repeated in para 54) that persistence of family life would be precarious if created when an applicant was in the UK unlawfully or was entitled to remain in the UK only temporarily.
In para 45 of his judgment in the present case Sales LJ recorded that it was common ground that the starting point for consideration of the proper construction of Part 5A of the 2002 Act is that sections 117A 117D are intended to provide for a structured approach to the application of article 8 which produces in all cases a final result which is compatible with, and not in violation of, article 8.
This remains common ground; and it is clearly correct.
But, insofar as the legislation is intended in all cases to produce a result compatible with the article, we will need to find somewhere within it provision for a degree, no doubt limited, of flexibility.
It is obvious that Parliament has imported the word precarious in section 117B(5) from the jurisprudence of the ECtHR to which I have referred.
But in the subsection it has applied the word to circumstances different from those to which the ECtHR has applied it.
In particular Parliament has deliberately applied the subsection to consideration only of an applicants private life, rather than also of his family life which has been the predominant focus in the ECtHR of the consideration identified in the Mitchell case.
The different focus of the subsection has required Parliament to adjust the formulation adopted in the ECtHR.
Instead of inquiry into whether the persistence of family life was precarious, the inquiry mandated by the subsection is whether the applicants immigration status was precarious.
And, because the focus is upon the applicant personally and because, perhaps unlike other family members, he or she should on any view be aware of the effect of his or her own immigration status, the subsection does not repeat the explicit need for awareness of its effect.
Apart from the judgment of Sales LJ in the present case, the leading authority on the meaning of the word precarious in section 117B(5) is the decision of the Upper Tribunal given by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Holmes on behalf of himself and Mr CMG Ockelton, the Vice President, in AM (S117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC), [2015] Imm AR 5.
The appellant, a citizen of Malawi, entered the UK in 2006 on a student visa.
In 2007 his wife and daughter joined him from Malawi.
In 2011 a second daughter was born.
The immigration status of his wife and daughters was dependent upon his status.
In 2012 the final extension of his student visa expired.
The Home Secretary determined to remove all four members of the family to Malawi.
The appellant challenged the determination by reference to the private life of each of the four of them.
He could not rely on their right to respect for their family life because the proposed removal of all of them together would not interfere with it.
The Upper Tribunal upheld the conclusion of the First tier Tribunal that their private lives in the UK had been established when their immigration status had been precarious within the meaning of section 117B(5) and that his appeal against the determination to remove them should be dismissed.
In explaining its decision the Upper Tribunal (a) noted at para 20 that, prior to the introduction of section 117B(5), the word precarious had been applied both in the ECtHR and in domestic courts not only to the status of a person lawfully present for a limited period but also to the situation of a person unlawfully present; (b) considered however at para 23 that Parliament had in section 117B(4) and (5) drawn a sharp distinction between a person in the UK unlawfully and one whose immigration status was precarious, with the result that, under the statute, a precarious immigration status did not include the situation of a person unlawfully present; (c) held at para 27 that all those granted a defined period of leave to remain in the UK, including discretionary leave to remain as well as leave of limited duration, had a precarious immigration status, even if they had a legitimate expectation that their leave would ultimately be extended indefinitely; (d) therefore at para 32 formulated its central decision as being that a persons immigration status was precarious for the purpose of section 117B(5) if his continued presence in the UK would be dependent upon a further grant of leave; and suggested at para 33 that even a grant of indefinite leave to remain (e) might render the persons status precarious if the grant had been obtained by deception or if he or she had embarked on a course of criminal conduct which would justify its withdrawal.
In the Deelah case, cited in para 21 above, McCloskey J, sitting in the Upper Tribunal as its President, stressed at paras 17 and 29 that in the case before him no issue arose as to whether the immigration status of the appellants had been precarious.
As an aside, however, at para 30, he described as clear and concise the central decision which in the AM case the same tribunal had recently reached (see para 39(d) above) and advised judges and practitioners constantly to be alert to it.
The court understands that, contrary to the law report of the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case, the AM case was cited to it.
At all events, for whatever reason, Sales LJ does not appear to have had in mind the strong indorsement in that case of the Home Secretarys contention that, for the purposes of section 117B(5), a person has a precarious immigration status if he or she has leave to remain in the UK which is other than indefinite.
The provisional view of Sales LJ, set out in para 25 above, was that leave to remain short of indefinite leave might sometimes confer on a person a status not properly to be described as precarious; and that the concept of precariousness might fall to be applied having regard to the persons overall circumstances.
The view of Sales LJ is entitled to great respect.
In para 36 above I have recognised the need for a degree, no doubt limited, of flexibility in the application of Part 5A of the 2002 Act.
But I will shortly explain how, elsewhere, the statute does permit a limited degree of it.
I do not consider that the ordinary meaning of the word precarious requires, or that in its context Parliament must have intended the word to require, that its application to the facts of a case should depend upon a subtle evaluation of the overall circumstances such as Sales LJ had in mind.
The bright line interpretation of the word precarious in section 117B(5), commended by the specialist tribunal with the maximum weight of its authority, is linguistically and teleologically legitimate; and, for that matter, it is consistent with the way in which the ECtHR expressed itself in the Jeunesse case (see para 34 above) and in which this court expressed itself in the Agyarko case (see para 35 above).
The answer to the primary question posed by the present appeal is therefore that everyone who, not being a UK citizen, is present in the UK and who has leave to reside here other than to do so indefinitely has a precarious immigration status for the purposes of section 117B(5).
It follows that Judge Blundell, upheld on this point in both the successive appeals, was correct to determine that Ms Rhuppiahs private life in the UK, having been established when, at any rate predominantly, she had leave to reside here as a student, was established at a time when her immigration status was precarious.
Irrelevant though it is, it may be worthwhile to note that even since 9 February 2018 her immigration status has been precarious.
Although she no doubt reasonably entertains a hope that in 2028 she may secure indefinite leave to remain, her present leave is to do so for 30 months: see para 6 above.
Another helpful feature of the Upper Tribunals decision in the AM case was its conclusion that the concept of a precarious immigration status under section 117B(5) did not include the situation of a person present in the UK unlawfully: see para 39(b) above.
It is well arguable in principle that a person unlawfully present has an immigration status to that effect and that, of course, it is precarious.
But in subsections (4) and (5) of section 117B Parliament has drawn a clear distinction between unlawful presence and a precarious immigration status.
In relation to a person unlawfully present, subsection (4) covers all the ground (indeed, at (4)(b), more than all the ground) which subsection (5) would cover; and there is nothing to indicate that, notwithstanding the clear distinction, Parliament intended subsection (5) to overlap with subsection (4).
The facts of the present case do not enable this court to appraise the further suggestion in the AM case that even a grant of indefinite leave to remain might yield a precarious immigration status in the circumstances identified at para 39(e) above.
The reader will however have noted that the suggestion derives partial support from the decision of the ECtHR in the Butt case, summarised at para 33 above.
It would be reasonable for this court to expect that its indorsement today of the conclusions in the AM case at paras 43 and 44 above will make it easier for decision makers to decide whether an immigration status was precarious at the relevant time.
In Ahmed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 300 (Admin) Green J observed, at para 44, that there was an element of precariousness but not a very strong one.
In Secretary of State for the Home Department v Thierno Barry [2018] EWCA Civ 790 Singh LJ observed at para 62 that the respondents position was not entirely precarious.
Neither case required consideration of section 117B(5); both courts were seeking outside the statute to weigh the consideration identified by the ECtHR in the Mitchell case in their appraisal of rights under article 8.
It is, however, to be hoped that decision makers will no longer need to wrestle with degrees of precariousness.
Section 117A(2)(a)
It was in section 117A(2)(a) of the 2002 Act that Parliament introduced the considerations listed in section 117B.
So, in respect of the consideration in section 117B(5), Parliaments instruction is to have regard to the consideration [that] [l]ittle weight should be given to a private life established by a person at a time when the persons immigration status is precarious.
McCloskey J suggested in para 23 of the Deelah case, cited in para 21 above, that the drafting wins no literary prizes.
But, as both parties agree, the effect of section 117A(2)(a) is clear.
It recognises that the provisions of section 117B cannot put decision makers in a strait jacket which constrains them to determine claims under article 8 inconsistently with the article itself.
Inbuilt into the concept of little weight itself is a small degree of flexibility; but it is in particular section 117A(2)(a) which provides the limited degree of flexibility recognised to be necessary in para 36 above.
Although this court today defines a precarious immigration status for the purpose of section 117B(5) with a width from which most applicants who rely on their private life under article 8 will be unable to escape, section 117A(2)(a) necessarily enables their applications occasionally to succeed.
It is impossible to improve on how, in inevitably general terms, Sales LJ in his judgment described the effect of section 117A(2)(a) as follows: 53.
Although a court or tribunal should have regard to the consideration that little weight should be given to private life established in [the specified] circumstances, it is possible without violence to the language to say that such generalised normative guidance may be overridden in an exceptional case
by particularly strong features of the private life in question
There was lively argument before the Court of Appeal about whether Judge Blundell understood the effect upon section 117B(5) of section 117A(2)(a), then recently enacted, and, if not, whether the advocates (none of whom appeared in this court) had failed to give him the necessary assistance in that regard.
For he concluded that he was required by statute to attach little weight to the aspects of her private life upon which Ms Rhuppiah relied and that he was bound to conclude that the harsh consequences which will flow from [her] removal are justified.
In the light of the now academic nature of the present appeal there is no need for this court either to explore this issue or to appraise the firm conclusion of Sales LJ at para 57, at first sight slightly surprising, that there were no such particularly strong features of Ms Rhuppiahs private life as would justify departure from the result indicated by section 117B(5).
Section 117B(3)
Section 117B(3) of the 2002 Act, set out in para 20 above, provides that it is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic well being of the UK, that persons who remain here are financially independent.
Then the subsection proceeds to give two reasons why their financial independence is in the public interest.
Judge Blundell held that, in that she was dependent on support from her father and from Ms Charles, Ms Rhuppiah was not financially independent and that this was a further consideration, negative to her claim under article 8, to which he was required to have regard.
The Court of Appeal, at paras 63 64, upheld his analysis and in doing so rejected the submission on behalf of Ms Rhuppiah that persons were financially independent for the purposes of section 117B(3) if they were not financially dependent upon the state.
The Home Secretary now agrees with the submission which was made, and which continues to be made, on behalf of Ms Rhuppiah about the meaning of financial independence in section 117B(3); but he adds uncontroversially that the evidence of support from third parties has to be credible and the support reliable.
This is the agreed area of error into which Judge Blundell and the Court of Appeal fell, to which reference was made in para 7 above.
The Home Secretary has changed his mind about the meaning of financial independence following the decision of this court in R (MM (Lebanon)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 10, [2017] 1 WLR 771, which post dated the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case.
In the MM and linked cases this court considered the financial requirements imposed by the rules upon non EEA family members wishing to join their relatives in the UK.
The court held that adherence to the rules, which had sought to exclude reliance on promises of third party support even if credible, might precipitate a violation of article 8.
The rules were changed accordingly.
The parties are correct to join in submitting to this court that financial independence in section 117B(3) means an absence of financial dependence upon the state.
Why would it be in the public interest that they should not be financially dependent on other persons? Why would it in particular be in the interests of the economic well being of the United Kingdom that they should not be dependent on them? Sales LJ suggested, at para 64, that the financial support provided to Ms Rhuppiah by her father and Ms Charles might cease, whereupon the obligation to maintain her would probably fall upon the state; but a cessation of a persons employment would probably have the same result.
Indeed the present case is a good example of the sometimes flimsy distinction between employment and third party support.
Anyone other than Ms Rhuppiah who provided extensive caring services to Ms Charles would need to be paid; and it is but an incident of their close friendship and of Ms Rhuppiahs legal inability to have taken employment prior to 9 February 2018 that instead the provision to her has taken the form of largely free board and lodging.
Regard must moreover be had to the first of the two reasons given in section 117B(3) for its statement as to where the public interest lay: because such persons are not a burden on taxpayers.
It was the view of Sales LJ at para 65 that, if the phrase financially independent referred to independence of the state, the quoted words were close to tautological.
Had those words been part of the statement as to where the public interest lay, one might more readily have agreed with his view.
But they are not part of the statement.
They are part of the explanation for it and in my view they unequivocally support the construction of section 117B(3) now agreed between the parties.
So Judge Blundell erred in concluding that Ms Rhuppiah was not financially independent within the meaning of section 117B(3).
The further submission on her behalf is and has been that the effect of section 117B(2) and (3) is to cast her ability to speak English and her financial independence as factors which positively weigh in her favour in the inquiry under article 8.
But the further submission is based on a misreading of the two subsections and was rightly rejected by Judge Blundell, upheld by the Court of Appeal, just as an analogous submission was rejected in para 18 of the decision in the AM case, cited at para 38 above.
The subsections do not say that it is in the public interest that those who are able to speak English and are financially independent should remain in the UK.
They say only that it is in the public interest that those who seek to remain in the UK should speak English and be financially independent; and the effect of the subsections is that, if claimants under article 8 do not speak English and/or are not financially independent, there is, for the two reasons given in almost identical terms in the subsections, a public interest which may help to justify the interference with their right to respect for their private or family life in the UK.
In seeking to portray the strength of their private or family life by reference to all their circumstances, claimants may wish to highlight their ability to speak English and/or their financial independence; but the legitimate deployment of such factors in that context is to be contrasted with the erroneous further submission that the subsections propel a conclusion that, where those factors exist, there is a public interest in favour of the claims.
Conclusion
It nevertheless follows that Judge Blundell erred in law in holding that section 117B(3) of the 2002 Act applied to Ms Rhuppiahs appeal and therefore that it identified an aspect of the public interest negative to her claim.
Was his error material? In any event section 117B(5) required him to give little weight to her private life.
But that requirement was subject to section 117A(2)(a), which conferred on him a limited degree of flexibility.
In the absence of his error in relation to section 117B(3), section 117A(2)(a) might properly have led him to uphold her claim, for which he had obvious sympathy.
I propose that we should allow Ms Rhuppiahs appeal to this court and should set aside his order upon her initial appeal; but that, for the reason given in para 8 above, we should not remit her initial appeal for fresh determination.
","Ms Rhuppiah, a Tanzanian national, entered the UK in 1997 with leave to reside here as a student for three months.
The Home Secretary granted further leave to her to reside in the UK as a student on 12 occasions, but some of these applications for leave were made after the previous leave had expired.
While they were studying at the same college, Ms Rhuppiah met Ms Charles, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, a gravely debilitating condition.
They have resided together since 2001.
Ms Rhuppiah cooks food suitable for Ms Charless medical condition and accompanies her to Bristol, to hospital and in effect everywhere.
Instead of paying her for looking after her in these respects, Ms Charles provides her with largely free board and lodging.
Ms Rhuppiah, a Seventh Day Adventist, cares for Ms Charles out of friendship, faith and habit.
Were Ms Rhuppiah to leave the UK, Ms Charless health would be compromised, her life turned upside down, and she would have to turn to the state for care.
After her final grant of leave expired in November 2009, Ms Rhuppiah twice failed to secure indefinite leave to remain in the UK, first because her residence here over the past ten years had not always been lawful, and second because she applied on the wrong form and by the time she reapplied the Immigration Rules, HC395 (the rules) had changed, fatally for her reapplication.
The Home Secretary was then obliged to determine whether her reapplication could nevertheless succeed outside the rules, on the basis of her right to respect for the private life she had established in the UK, including her friendship with Ms Charles, under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Home Secretarys determination on this basis was also negative.
Ms Rhuppiah challenged the Home Secretarys decision at the First tier Tribunal (FTT).
Under section 117B(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act), little weight should be given to an applicants private life if it was established in the UK at a time when his or her immigration status was precarious.
The FTT dismissed Ms Rhuppiahs challenge on the basis that this provision applied to her; and that, besides, she was not financially independent (another consideration, which section 117B(3) of the 2002 Act required the Home Secretary to weigh against her right to respect for her private life) as she depended on support from her father and from Ms Charles.
Ms Rhuppiah appealed unsuccessfully to the Upper Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.
Her appeal has now become academic, because she has now lived continuously in the UK for long enough to secure leave to remain by a different route.
The Supreme Court nevertheless heard the appeal, because of the public importance of providing a definitive interpretation of the word precarious in section 117B(5).
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
Lord Wilson gives the only judgment.
Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 requires the Home Secretary to act compatibly with the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights, including the right under article 8 to respect for private and family life.
Removing an applicant from the UK may interfere with this right.
Therefore, if the Home Secretary refuses a persons application for leave to remain in the UK under the rules, he must nevertheless consider whether to grant leave on the basis of their right under article 8.
Article 8 gives him a limited discretion to determine whether the interference is justified [4].
Section 117A(2) of the 2002 Act prompts decision makers exercising this discretion to have regard to the public interest considerations in section 117B, which include: the maintenance of effective immigration controls; that persons in the UK can speak English and are financially independent; and that little weight should be given to a private life established by a person at a time when they are in the UK unlawfully or when the persons immigration status is precarious [20 21].
A persons immigration status in the UK can therefore be precarious even when he or she is lawfully present here [24].
Equally, the concept of little weight and the wording of section 117A(2) give decision makers a limited degree of flexibility to uphold an article 8 claim on the basis of the applicants right to respect for private life, even if it was established when the applicants immigration status was precarious [49].
The Court of Appeal accepted that Ms Rhuppiahs own immigration status was precarious, but suggested that some immigrants could have an immigration status which was not precarious even though they did not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK.
It added that the concept of precariousness might fall to be applied having regard to the persons overall circumstances.
The Supreme Court holds that the application of the concept of precariousness does not depend on such a subtle evaluation of the overall circumstances as suggested by the Court of Appeal [25, 42].
The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has approached the concept of precariousness in the context of the right to family life by asking whether the family life was created at a time when the parties knew that the immigration status of one of them made its persistence in the host state precarious from the outset [28].
Therefore, it distinguished the situation of an applicant who (though not present unlawfully) was no more than tolerated by the host state while it determined her various applications for residence permits and consequential appeals, from that of settled migrants who had formally been granted a right of residence.
The Supreme Court has previously addressed this ECtHR decision, suggesting that family life will be precarious if created when an applicant was here unlawfully or had only a temporary right to remain in the UK [34 45].
Section 117B imports the concept of precariousness from the ECtHR case law.
But the section only applies to an applicants private life [37].
In a case not cited to the Court of Appeal, the Upper Tribunal previously held that a persons immigration status was precarious for the purpose of section 117B(5) if his continued presence in the UK would be dependent upon a further grant of leave [38 39].
The Supreme Court now approves this decision.
Everyone who, not being a UK citizen, is present in the UK and who has leave to reside here other than to do so indefinitely, has a precarious immigration status for the purposes of section 117B(5) [44].
This bright line interpretation is consistent with the ECtHR and Supreme Courts language in the decisions referred to above [43].
The FTT nonetheless erred in concluding that Ms Rhuppiah was not financially independent within the meaning of section 117B(3).
The Supreme Court holds that financially independent in section 117B(3) means not financially dependent upon the state.
It therefore allows Ms Rhuppiahs appeal [52 58].
"
uksc-2014-0138,"In this country, we are wary of giving too much power to the police.
We believe that we should be free to be out and about in public without being subjected to compulsory powers of the police, at least unless and until they have reasonable grounds to suspect that we are up to no good.
We have so far resisted suggestions that we should all have to carry identity cards that the police can demand to see whenever they want.
We have unhappy memories of police powers to stop and search suspected persons even with reasonable grounds.
We are even more suspicious of police powers to stop and search without having reasonable grounds to suspect that we are committing or going to commit a crime.
Nevertheless, there are a few instances in which our Parliament has decided that such suspicionless stop and search powers are necessary for the protection of the public from terrorism or serious crime.
The court can examine whether such a law is itself compatible with the rights set out in Schedule 1 to the Human Rights Act 1998.
However, if it finds that it is not, the most the court can do is to make a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Human Rights Act, leaving it to Parliament to decide what, if anything, to do about it.
This is the primary remedy sought by Mr Southey QC on behalf of the claimant in this case.
But, under section 6 of the Human Rights Act, even a compatible law has to be operated compatibly with the Convention rights in any individual case.
There are many laws which are capable of being operated both compatibly and incompatibly, depending upon the facts of the particular case.
The compatibility of the law itself has therefore to be judged in conjunction with the duty of the police to operate it in a compatible manner.
The law in question is contained in section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.
It is now common ground that the power of suspicionless stop and search which it contains is an interference with the right to respect for private life, protected by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, although perhaps not at the gravest end of such interferences.
It is also common ground that the power pursues one of the legitimate aims which is capable of justifying such interferences under article 8(2), namely the prevention of disorder or crime.
The argument is about whether it is in accordance with the law as is also required by article 8(2).
In one sense, of course it is, because it is contained in an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament.
But the Convention concept of legality entails more than mere compliance with the domestic law.
It requires that the law be compatible with the rule of law.
This means that it must be sufficiently accessible and foreseeable for the individual to regulate his conduct accordingly.
More importantly in this case, there must be sufficient safeguards against the risk that it will be used in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner.
As Lord Kerr put it in Beghal v Director of Public Prosecutions (Secretary of State for the Home Department and others intervening) [2015] UKSC 49; [2015] 3 WLR 344, at para 93, The opportunity to exercise a coercive power in an arbitrary or discriminatory fashion is antithetical to its legality in this sense.
Section 60
offensive weapons in a particular locality at a particular time.
It provides: (l) If a police officer of or above the rank of inspector reasonably believes Section 60 is directed towards the risk of violence involving knives and other that incidents involving serious violence may (a) take place in any locality in his police area, and that it is expedient to give an authorisation under this section to prevent their occurrence, (aa) that (i) an incident involving serious violence has taken place in England and Wales in his police area; (ii) a dangerous instrument or offensive weapon used in the incident is being carried in any locality in his police area by a person; and it is expedient to give an authorisation (iii) under this section to find the instrument or weapon; or (b) that persons are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons in any locality in his police area without good reason, he may give an authorisation that the powers conferred by this section are to be exercisable at any place within that locality for a specified period not exceeding 24 hours. (3) If it appears to an officer of or above the rank of superintendent that it is expedient to do so, having regard to offences which have, or are reasonably suspected to have, been committed in connection with any activity falling within the authorisation, he may direct that the authorisation shall continue in being for a further 24 hours. (3A) If an inspector gives an authorisation under subsection (1) he must, as soon as it is practicable to do so, cause an officer of or above the rank of superintendent to be informed. (4) This section confers on any constable in uniform power to stop any pedestrian and search him or anything (a) carried by him for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments; (b) to stop any vehicle and search the vehicle, its driver and any passenger for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments. (5) A constable may, in the exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (4) above, stop any person or vehicle and make any search he thinks fit whether or not he has any grounds for suspecting that the person or vehicle is carrying weapons or articles of that kind.
Dangerous instruments are defined in section 60(11) as instruments which have a blade or are sharply pointed.
Offensive weapons have the same meaning as in section 1(9) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), that is, any article (a) made or adapted for use for causing injury to persons; or (b) intended by the person having it with him for such use by him or by some other person.
If an incident of serious violence has already taken place (as contemplated by section 60(1)(aa)), it includes any article used in the incident to cause or threaten injury to any person or otherwise to intimidate .
Thus it will be seen that the individual police officers powers in section 60(4) and (5) depend upon a general authorisation (a) given by an officer of the rank of inspector or above, (b) for a period of up to 24 hours, although renewable for one further period of 24 hours, (c) within a particular locality, and (d) where the senior police officer reasonably believes that one or more of the three grounds set out in section 60(1) exists.
Section 60(5) makes it clear that the individual police officer operating under such an authorisation does not have to have any grounds for suspecting that the person or vehicle stopped and searched is carrying offensive weapons or dangerous instruments.
But section 60(4) makes it clear that his or her purpose must be to search for such things.
The exercise of the powers set out in section 60 is subject to a number of safeguards and restrictions, including those contained in section 2 of PACE and in the Code of Practice for the exercise of such powers, issued under section 66 of that Act.
In the Metropolitan Police area, it is also subject to the Metropolitan Police Services published Standard Operating Procedures, both on the general Principles for Stop and Search and on Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 in particular.
It is well established that failure to comply with published policy will render the exercise of compulsory powers which interfere with individual freedom unlawful: R (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12; [2012] 1 AC 245.
It is also likely to expose the individual officer to disciplinary action.
It will therefore be necessary to return to these additional constraints in some detail later.
The facts
The events which gave rise to these proceedings took place on 9 September 2010.
There was then a significant problem of gang related violence in the London Borough of Haringey, resulting from tensions between two rival gangs, and the risk that gangs from outside the borough would come to their aid.
Between 1 and 9 September there were many police intelligence reports relating to violent crime and the use of firearms, knives and other offensive weapons.
There was an attempted murder and a stabbing on 4 September and another stabbing on 5 September.
On 8 September there were intelligence reports about the use or storage or movement of firearms.
These indicated a risk of further violence on the afternoon, evening and night of 9 September.
In the morning of 9 September, Superintendent Barclay, Superintendent (Operations) in the Borough of Haringey, formed the belief (under section 60(1)(a)) that further incidents of serious violence were likely to take place that day and also (under section 60(1)(aa)) that people would be travelling to Haringey in possession of weapons that had been used in the incidents which had already taken place.
Accordingly at 11.20 am he completed Form 5096, which constituted the authorisation.
This authorised searches between 1.00 pm on 9 September 2010 and 6.00 am on 10 September in the whole Borough of Haringey apart from the wards of Fortis Green, Highgate, Bounds Green, Alexandra, Muswell Hill and Woodside.
Under Grounds he checked the boxes corresponding to section 60(1)(a) and (aa).
Under Additional notes was stated There are increasing tensions at present between gangs in this borough and boroughs beyond those neighbouring ours.
A section 60 in the terms requested would support the aims of the tasked resources [to tackle Most Serious Violence, Serious Youth Violence and Knife Enabled Crime] and be a visible presence to deter the commission of offences in this borough.
There followed details of the numerous intelligence reports, many to do with rivalry between the Wood Green Mob and the Grey Gang, which had led to this belief.
The form concluded that In respect of the Human Rights Act 1998 Authorisation is Proportionate, Legal, Accountable and Necessary, in order to protect members of the public from being involved/surrounded by serious unlawful violence between opposing gang members.
There is a history of violence between rival gangs on the borough which has previously resulted in serious assaults and criminal damage.
Officers on duty were notified of the authorisation either in their daily briefing packs or over their radios.
At the time of these events, Mrs Roberts was 37 years old, and working as a support worker providing in class support for young people with disabilities and learning difficulties.
She had no convictions or cautions for criminal offences.
She is of African Caribbean heritage.
On 9 September 2010, shortly after 1.00 pm, she was travelling on the No 149 bus in Tottenham.
She had not paid her fare.
A ticket inspector read her Oyster card and found that, not only had it not been validated for that journey, but also that it did not have enough funds on it to pay the fare.
When questioned, Mrs Roberts gave a false name and address and also falsely stated that she did not have any identification with her.
The police were called and Police Constable Jacqui Reid attended.
Mrs Roberts again denied having any identification with her.
She appeared nervous and was keeping a tight hold upon her bag.
PC Reid considered that she was holding her bag in a suspicious manner and might have an offensive weapon inside it.
It was not uncommon for women of a similar age to carry weapons for other people.
Earlier that day PC Reid had been involved in the search of such a woman who had been found to be in possession of a firearm and an offensive weapon and arrested.
PC Reid explained her powers under section 60 of the 1994 Act and that she would search Mrs Roberts bag.
Mrs Roberts said that she would prefer to be searched in a police station.
PC Reid said that this was unnecessary and she would do it there and then.
As she went to take Mrs Roberts bag, Mrs Roberts kept tight hold of it and began to walk away.
She was restrained and handcuffed but continued to walk away.
Eventually the police succeeded in restraining her.
PC Reid searched her bag and Mrs Roberts gave her correct name and address.
Inside the bag were bank cards in Mrs Roberts name and in two other names.
She was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods, but no further action on that matter was taken once it was confirmed that the cards were indeed her own, in her maiden name, and her sons.
PC Reid completed Form 5090, which recorded when and where the search had taken place, and gave the following reasons: Area is a hot spot for gang violence and people in possession of knives.
Subject kept holding tightly onto her bag and appeared nervous and as if trying to conceal something she didnt want police to find.
Mrs Roberts was handed a copy of this form after she was arrested and interviewed at the police station for the offence of obstructing the search.
She was later cautioned for that offence but the caution was quashed by consent following the institution of these proceedings.
Mrs Roberts explains that she did not want to be searched on the street because she was concerned that some of the young people with whom she worked might see it.
But it is now conceded that PC Reid acted in accordance with section 60 of the 1994 Act, and indeed that the interference with Mrs Roberts article 8 rights was proportionate to the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime.
Mrs Roberts brought judicial review proceedings alleging breaches of article 5 and of article 8 and of article 14.
Both the Divisional Court ([2012] EWHC 1977 (Admin)) and the Court of Appeal ([2014] EWCA Civ 69; [2014] 1 WLR 3299) held that there was no deprivation of liberty within the meaning of article 5 (and there is no appeal against that).
Both courts rejected the claim that the section 60 power was used in a manner which discriminated on grounds of race, contrary to article 14 (and there is no appeal against that).
Both courts held that there was an interference with the right to respect for Mrs Roberts private life in article 8, but that it was in accordance with the law.
That is the issue in this appeal.
The case law
As it is admitted that the interference with Mrs Roberts rights was, in the circumstances, proportionate to the legitimate aim of preventing crime, her claim can only succeed if the power under which it was done is in itself incompatible with the Convention rights because it does not have the character of law as required by the Convention.
As Lord Reed explained in R (T) v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police [2014] UKSC 35; [2015] AC 49, at para 114, for the interference to be in accordance with the law, there must be safeguards which have the effect of enabling the proportionality of the interference to be adequately examined.
Whether the interference in a given case was in fact proportionate is a separate question.
The T case, as Lord Hughes explained in Beghal, at para 31, was concerned with a rigid rule which did not have the flexibility to ensure that interferences with article 8 rights were proportionate.
In Beghal, as in this case, on the other hand, the court was concerned with the reverse situation, where safeguards may be required to guard against a broad discretion being used in an arbitrary, and thus disproportionate manner.
This is the first case in which the power in section 60 has come before this court or before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
But two other powers of stop and search have come before this court or its predecessor, the appellate committee of the House of Lords, and one of those cases has gone to the Strasbourg court.
We will deal with these, and another relevant Strasbourg decision, in chronological order.
R (Gillan) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2006] UKHL 12; [2006] 2 AC 307, concerned the powers in sections 44 to 46 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Section 44(4) empowered a police officer of at least the rank of assistant chief constable to grant an authorisation for a renewable period of up to 28 days covering a specified area or place, which could be the whole of a police area.
The practice was to grant successive 28 days authorisations covering the whole Metropolitan Police area.
Under section 46(3) to (7), authorisations were subject to confirmation by the Home Secretary within 48 hours, failing which they ceased to have effect.
But such confirmation had never been refused.
Under section 44(3), authorisations can be given only if the person giving it considers it expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism, a very broad ground.
Terrorism is widely defined in section 1 of the 2000 Act.
Under section 44(1) and (2) an authorisation allowed any uniformed police officer to stop a vehicle in the area and search it, the driver and any passenger, and to stop a pedestrian in the area and search the pedestrian and anything carried by him.
Under section 45(1), the power could be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism, but whether or not the constable has grounds for suspecting the presence of articles of that kind.
Under section 45(4), he could detain the person or vehicle for such time as is reasonably required to permit the search to be carried out at or near the place where the person or vehicle is stopped.
Two people, a student and a journalist, who had been stopped and searched on their way to a demonstration, complained of breaches of several Convention rights, including article 8.
rights in question, Lord Bingham said this, at para 34: In considering the Convention requirement of legality common to all the The lawfulness requirement in the Convention addresses supremely important features of the rule of law.
The exercise of power by public officials, as it affects members of the public, must be governed by clear and publicly accessible rules of law.
The public must not be vulnerable to interference by public officials acting on any personal whim, caprice, malice, predilection or purpose other than that for which the power was conferred.
This is what, in this context, is meant by arbitrariness, which is the antithesis of legality.
This is the test which any interference with or derogation from a Convention right must meet if a violation is to be avoided.
He went on to hold, at para 35, that the power in question did meet these requirements.
That the constable need have no suspicion cannot, realistically, be interpreted as a warrant to stop and search people who are obviously not terrorist suspects, which would be futile and time wasting.
It is to ensure that a constable is not deterred from stopping and searching a person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his suspicion.
He had earlier, at para 14, when rejecting the argument that expedient must be read down to necessary identified 11 constraints on the abuse of the power.
The other members of the committee agreed with him on this point, while adding observations of their own, in particular that race or ethnicity could never be the sole ground for choosing a person to stop and search.
In Gillan v United Kingdom (2010) 50 EHRR 1105, the Strasbourg court took a different view.
The authorisation could be given for reasons of expediency rather than necessity.
Once given, it was renewable indefinitely.
The temporal and geographical restrictions were no real check.
Above all, the court was concerned at the breadth of the discretion given to the individual police officer, the lack of any need to show reasonable suspicion, or even subjectively to suspect anything about the person stopped and searched, and the risks of discriminatory use and of misuse against demonstrators and protesters in breach of article 10 or 11 of the Convention.
In particular, in the absence of any obligation on the part of the officer to show a reasonable suspicion, it is likely to be difficult if not impossible to prove that the power was improperly exercised (para 86).
Hence the applicants article 8 rights had been violated.
Despite this, it cannot be concluded from Gillan that the Strasbourg court would regard every suspicionless power to stop and search as failing the Convention requirement of lawfulness.
In Colon v The Netherlands (2012) 55 EHRR SE45, it declared inadmissible a complaint about a Dutch power which in some respects was more comparable to the power at issue in this case than was the power in Gillan.
Acting under the Municipalities Act, with the authority of a byelaw passed by the local council, the Burgomaster of Amsterdam designated most of the old centre of Amsterdam as a security risk area for a period of six months and again for a further period of 12 months.
Under the Arms and Ammunition Act, this enabled a public prosecutor to order that, for a randomly selected period of 12 hours, any person within the designated area might be searched for the presence of weapons.
The prosecutor had to give reasons for the order by reference to recent reports.
The applicant refused to submit to a search when stopped and was arrested and prosecuted for failing to obey a lawful order.
The applicants complaint that this interference with his article 8 rights was not in accordance with the law was limited to the ineffectiveness of the judicial remedies available, in particular that no prior judicial authorisation for the order was necessary (para 74).
The court pointed out that the Burgomasters designation had to be based on a byelaw adopted by an elected representative body, which also had powers to investigate the Burgomasters use of the power.
There was also an objection and appeal mechanism.
The criminal courts could then examine the lawfulness of the use made of it.
Hence the power was in accordance with the law (paras 75 79).
The court went on to find that the interference was necessary in a democratic society.
The legal framework involved both the Burgomaster and the prosecutor, hence no single executive officer could alone order a preventive search operation.
These preventive searches were having their intended effect of helping to reduce violent crime in Amsterdam.
These reasons were sufficient to justify the unpleasantness and inconvenience to the applicant.
Mr Southey suggests that the reference, in the Dutch governments observations, to the individual police officers being given no latitude in deciding when to exercise their powers (para 68) must mean that they had to stop everyone in the designated area during the 12 hours in question and that therefore there was no risk of arbitrary decision making.
That cannot be right.
Old Amsterdam is a sizeable area frequented by many people both for business and for pleasure purposes.
His better point is that the applicant limited his complaint to the lack of prior judicial sanction.
The fact remains that the Strasbourg court held that particular suspicionless stop and search power compatible with article 8.
More recently, in Beghal, the Supreme Court has considered a rather different power, under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000.
This allows a police or immigration officer to question a person at a port or in the border area whom he believes to be entering or leaving the United Kingdom or travelling by air within it.
It also applies to a person on board a ship or aircraft which has arrived anywhere in the United Kingdom.
The object of the questioning is to determine whether the person appears to be a terrorist within the meaning of that part of the Act.
But the officer does not have to have grounds for suspecting that he does.
This core power is supplemented by additional powers to stop, search and detain the person for a short time, and to require the production of documents.
The claimant was stopped and questioned for an hour and three quarters on returning to this country from a visit to her husband in France where he was in custody in relation to terrorist offences.
She was prosecuted for refusing to answer some of the questions.
By a majority, Lord Kerr dissenting, the Supreme Court declined to hold that the prosecution was an unjustified interference with her Convention rights.
Lord Hughes (with whom Lord Hodge agreed) pointed out that there is a distinction between port controls and street searches.
The former are a lesser intrusion than the latter.
We expect people to be searched at airports, for the safety of all.
He listed, at para 43, a number of effective safeguards which he considered sufficient to meet the requirement of legality: They include: (i) the restriction to those passing into and out of the country; (ii) the restriction to the statutory purpose; (iii) the restriction to specially trained and accredited police officers; (iv) the restrictions on the duration of questioning; (v) the restrictions on the type of search; (vi) the requirement to give explanatory notice to those questioned ; (vii) the requirement to permit consultation with a solicitor and the notification of a third party; (viii) the requirement for records to be kept; (ix) the availability of judicial review if bad faith or collateral purpose is alleged, and also via the principle of legitimate expectation where a breach of the code of practice or of the several restrictions listed above is in issue;
Lord Neuberger and Lord Dyson agreed, adding that in considering whether the legality principle was satisfied, one must look not only at the provisions of the statute or other relevant instrument which gives rise to the system in question but also at how that system actually works in practice (para 86).
The differences from the system in Gillan showed that these powers were more foreseeable and less arbitrary (para 87).
They could only be exercised (i) at ports and airports; (ii) against those passing through the UKs borders; (iii) for a limited purpose (para 88).
Unlike the powers in Gillan, they were not extraordinary; they were used against a tiny proportion of passengers; and they yielded useful results.
Nor could they be used against demonstrators and protesters (para 89).
They also pointed out that it was important to the effectiveness of these powers that they be exercised randomly and therefore unpredictably.
If this were not permissible the valuable power would either have to be abandoned or exercised in a far more invasive and extensive way, by questioning everyone passing through ports and airports (para 91).
Mr Southey points out that there are other ways of securing the benefit of random and thus unpredictable searches than leaving the choice of whom to search to individual police officers.
He himself has experienced a system in Mexico where passengers were randomly given a red or a green light: those given a red light were searched, those given a green light were not.
It is, however, rather hard to see how this would work with searches conducted on the street or even on the No 149 bus.
The other constraints
In addition to the limited scope of the power in section 60 itself, it is necessary to take into account the other constraints upon the exercise of these powers.
Those constraints arise both from the legal protection of the citizen from the misuse of police powers, and from the mechanisms designed to ensure that the police are accountable for their actions.
In relation to legal protection, we have mentioned section 6 of the Human Rights Act, to which it will be necessary to return.
In the event of a breach of that section, the victim of the unlawful act is entitled to seek a judicial remedy under section 8, which might in an appropriate case include an award of damages (as, for example, in H v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (Liberty and another intervening) [2013] EWCA Civ 69; [2013] 1 WLR 3021).
But the legal protection of the citizen pre dates the Human Rights Act.
In relation to searches, the starting point is the common law, under which it is contrary to constitutional principle and illegal to search someone to establish whether there are grounds for an arrest (Jackson v Stevenson (1897) 2 Adam 255).
Powers of stop and search therefore require Parliamentary authority.
The 1994 Act is one of a number of statutes which provide such authority.
Like other aspects of the relationship between the citizen and the police, however, the exercise of the powers conferred by the 1994 Act is subject to detailed statutory regulation by PACE.
Where there is a failure to comply with PACE, rendering the search unlawful, the victim can in principle bring an action for damages against the chief constable (or, in the case of the Metropolitan Police, the Commissioner), who is vicariously liable for the unlawful acts committed by his or her officers (as, for example, in OLoughlin v Chief Constable of Essex [1998] 1 WLR 374 and Abraham v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2001] 1 WLR 1257).
Legal remedies before the courts are not, however, the only mechanism for protecting citizens against the misuse of police powers and ensuring the accountability of police officers.
At a national level, a variety of powers are possessed by the Home Secretary, including the power to issue Codes of Practice under section 66 of PACE, and the power to appoint Her Majestys Inspectors of Constabulary and to direct them to carry out inspections and report to her, under section 54 of the Police Act 1996.
A wide range of policing matters, including operational decisions by chief constables, are also examined in Parliament by the Home Affairs Select Committee.
At a local level, police and crime commissioners, directly elected by the communities they serve and subject to scrutiny by local police and crime panels, are responsible for holding the chief constable of their area to account for the way in which he or she, and the people under his or her direction and control, exercise their functions: Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, section 1(7).
In relation to the Metropolitan Police, the equivalent function is performed by the Mayors Office for Policing and Crime, an office occupied by the Mayor of London: section 3(7) of the 2011 Act.
At the time of the events with which this appeal is concerned, a broadly similar function was performed by police authorities established under the Police and Magistrates Courts Act 1994, and, in relation to the Metropolitan Police, by the Metropolitan Police Authority established under the Greater London Authority Act 1999.
In individual cases, complaints about the misuse of police powers can be made to the chief constable (or, in the case of the Metropolitan Police, to the Commissioner), to the police and crime commissioner (or, in the case of the Metropolitan Police, to the Mayors Office for Policing and Crime), or to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, an independent body established under the Police Reform Act 2002.
Provision is made under that Act for the determination of complaints and for a system of appeals.
That general explanation forms the background to the constraints and safeguards applying specifically to the powers with which this appeal is concerned.
First there are the requirements of sections 2 and 3 of PACE, which apply to most stop and search powers, including those under section 60 of the 1994 Act.
Under section 2, before the officer begins the search, he must take reasonable steps to tell the person being searched his name, the station to which he is attached, the object of the search and the grounds for making it, and that the person can only be detained for the time reasonably required to carry out the search.
Breach of section 2 would render the search unlawful (Osman v Director of Public Prosecutions (1999) 163 JP 725).
Section 3 requires the officer to make a record in writing unless this is not practicable, either as part of the custody record if the person is arrested and taken to a police station or on the spot or as soon as practicable after the search if he is not.
The person searched is entitled to a copy of the record if he asks for one within three months.
This was the Form 5090 handed over to Mrs Roberts after her arrest (see para 12 above).
Next there are the statutory Codes of Practice, issued under section 66 of PACE.
Code A relates to the exercise by police officers of statutory powers of stop and search.
This governs both the authorisation and the search itself.
It is not practicable to cite all the relevant paragraphs of the 2009 version in force at the time of this encounter.
But the flavour may be gleaned from para 1.1: Powers to stop and search must be used fairly, responsibly, with respect for people being searched and without unlawful discrimination.
The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 makes it unlawful for police officers to discriminate on the grounds of race, colour, ethnic origin, nationality or national origins when using their powers.
Mr Southey complains that this does not in terms tell police officers that they must not select people on grounds of race or ethnicity alone.
But that is what discrimination means.
If anything, this paragraph is clearer than the one in the current (2015) version, which has been updated to refer to all the characteristics now protected by the Equality Act 2010, without listing them.
The current Code does contain a helpful paragraph, para 2.14A, which was not present in the earlier version: The selection of persons and vehicles under section 60 to be stopped and, if appropriate, searched should reflect an objective assessment of the nature of the incident or weapon in question and the individuals and vehicles thought likely to be associated with that incident or those weapons.
The powers must not be used to stop and search persons and vehicles for reasons unconnected with the purpose of the authorisation.
When selecting persons and vehicles to be stopped in response to a specific threat or incident, officers must take care not to discriminate unlawfully against anyone on the grounds of any of the protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010 (see para 1.1).
Nevertheless, the earlier Code explains and stresses the importance of explaining and recording the reasons for the stop (paras 3.8 3.11 and section 4).
Supervising officers must monitor the use of stop and search powers and should consider in particular whether there is any evidence that they are being exercised on the basis of stereotyped images or inappropriate generalisations (para 5.1).
They must keep comprehensive statistical records so as to identify disproportionate use either by particular officers or against particular sections of the community (para 5.3).
As to the authorisation, both the period of time and the geographical area defined in the authorisation must be the minimum necessary to achieve the legislative aim (para 2.13 and Notes for Guidance, para 13).
Thus the authorisation in this case was for less than the maximum 24 hours permitted and the area, although substantial, excluded quite large areas of the borough of Haringey.
The Notes for Guidance, at para 10, stress that: The powers under section 60 are separate from and additional to the normal stop and search powers which require reasonable grounds to suspect an individual of carrying an offensive weapon (or other article).
Their overall purpose is to prevent serious violence and the widespread carrying of weapons which might lead to persons being seriously injured by disarming potential offenders in circumstances where other powers would not be sufficient.
They should not therefore be used to replace or circumvent the normal powers for dealing with routine crime problems.
Paragraph 11 points out that authorisations require a reasonable belief that must have an objective basis, of which examples are given.
Then there are the applicable policies and instructions of the police force in question, in this case, the Metropolitan Police.
The Metropolitan Police Standard Operating Procedures are published on their website.
These largely repeat the requirements of the legislation and the Code, but with some additional features.
They are designed to be relatively simple to use and easy to remember.
The Principles for Stops and Searches, current at the time, contains a section on the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, which extended the duties in the Race Relations Act 1976 to public authorities including the police.
This reminds officers of their general duty to have due regard to eliminating unlawful discrimination.
More to the point, it states that Officers must be aware that to go beyond their powers and search somebody solely on grounds of race, colour, or otherwise treat someone unfavourably on such grounds is unlawful and the individual officer, in addition to the Commissioner, may face legal or disciplinary proceedings.
The Principles also contain a section on Human Rights, instructing officers to apply the PLAN B checklist to all their decision making.
Their actions must be Proportionate, have a Legal power or purpose, Accountable (through record keeping and scrutiny), Necessary in the circumstances and use the Best information available.
The specific Standard Operating Procedures on Section 60 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, current at the time, instructed senior officers giving the authorisation that these must be justified on the basis that the exercise of the power is, in all circumstances a proportionate and necessary response for achieving the purpose for which Parliament provided the power.
It reminds officers that they must have a reasonable belief in the grounds and that there must be an objective basis in intelligence or relevant information.
It suggests that the use of section 60 should be considered where there has been a significant increase in knife point robberies in a limited area and also, for example, for gang related violence or disorder, football related violence and events such as demonstrations and music concerts that typically include a large scale gathering of people which, combined with other factors, indicate a likelihood of violence or the commission of offences.
It stresses the importance of engagement with local community groups and of feedback.
Briefings should be the rule, if practicable.
For individual officers carrying out the stop and search, it provides guidance on filling out Form 5090 and about the encounter.
The mnemonic GOWISELY (Grounds, Object, Warrant, Station, Entitlement to a copy, Legal power, and tell the person You are being detained) applies, with some additional guidance.
These instructions are regularly reviewed.
Since the encounter in question they have been updated to take account of the Best Use of Stop and Search Scheme (BUSS), issued by the Home Secretary and College of Policing in April 2014 following reports prepared by Her Majestys Inspectors of Constabulary, under the direction of the Home Secretary, on the use of stop and search powers.
Announcing this to Parliament, the Home Secretary explained that she had long been concerned about the use of stop and search by the police.
Although an important police power, when misused it could be counter productive.
It was an enormous waste of police time.
And when innocent people were stopped and searched for no good reason it was hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public.
Nevertheless, adopting the scheme was not compulsory.
Police forces in this country are not subject to direction from the government.
They are operationally independent.
But in fact all of them have adopted it, including the Metropolitan Police.
BUSS covers all kinds of stop and search powers, but in relation to section 60 it specifically provides: (i) that Forces in the scheme will raise the level of authorisation to Assistant Chief Constable (or the equivalent in the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police); (ii) that authorisations must only be given when the officer believes it necessary, rather than merely expedient, for any of the statutory purposes; (iii) that in relation to future serious violence, the officer must reasonably believe that it will, rather than may, take place; (iv) that authorisations should be for no more than 15 hours in the first instance; and (v) that Forces must communicate with the public in the area in advance where practicable and afterwards.
Mr Southey argues that these improvements show that section 60 as enacted does not contain sufficient safeguards.
On behalf of the Secretary of State, Lord Keen QC argues that BUSS is irrelevant.
The Home Secretarys determination to seek improvements in the operation of all stop and search powers in order to promote better community relations does not prove that the previous use of the power was not in accordance with the law.
However, it is worth bearing in mind that there has been a very significant reduction in the use of these powers in recent years.
Discussion
Any random suspicionless power of stop and search carries with it the risk that it will be used in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner in individual cases.
There are, however, great benefits to the public in such a power, as was pointed out both by Lord Neuberger and Lord Dyson in Beghal and by Moses LJ in this case.
It is the randomness and therefore the unpredictability of the search which has the deterrent effect and also increases the chance that weapons will be detected.
The purpose of this is to reduce the risk of serious violence where knives and other offensive weapons are used, especially that associated with gangs and large crowds.
It must be borne in mind that many of these gangs are largely composed of young people from black and minority ethnic groups.
While there is a concern that members of these groups should not be disproportionately targeted, it is members of these groups who will benefit most from the reduction in violence, serious injury and death that may result from the use of such powers.
Put bluntly, it is mostly young black lives that will be saved if there is less gang violence in London and some other cities.
It cannot be too often stressed that, whatever the scope of the power in question, it must be operated in a lawful manner.
It is not enough simply to look at the content of the power.
It has to be read in conjunction with section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, which makes it unlawful for a police officer to act in a manner which is incompatible with the Convention rights of any individual.
It has also to be read in conjunction with the Equality Act 2010, which makes it unlawful for a police officer to discriminate on racial grounds in the exercise of his powers.
It might be thought that these two additional legal restraints were sufficient safeguard in themselves.
The result of breaching either will be legal liability and probably disciplinary sanctions as well.
It is said that, without the need to have reasonable grounds for suspecting the person or vehicle stopped to be carrying a weapon, it is hard to judge the proportionality of the stop.
However, that is to leave out of account all the other features, contained in a mixture of the Act itself, PACE and the Force Standard Operating Procedures, which guard against the risk that the officer will not, in fact, have good reasons for the decision.
The result of breaching these will in many cases be to render the stop and search itself unlawful and to expose the officers concerned to disciplinary action.
First, as to the authorisation itself: (i) the officer has reasonably to believe that the grounds for making an authorisation exist; (ii) those grounds are much more tightly framed than the grounds in Gillan; (iii) the officers belief clearly has to be based on evidence; (iv) he has to record in writing, not only what his grounds are, but the evidence on which his belief is based; (v) he has expressly to consider whether the action is necessary and proportionate to the danger contemplated; (vi) that is why, in reality, he has to believe that an authorisation is necessary rather than merely expedient; (vii) the authorisation can only be for a very limited period of time; (viii) it can only be renewed once for a limited period of time; rolling renewals are not possible; (ix) it can only cover a limited geographical area; (x) it is subject to review.
Second, as to the operation itself: (i) there should be prior briefing if possible and certainly de briefing afterwards; (ii) there should be prior community engagement if possible and certainly afterwards; (iii) where the authorisation is given by an officer below the rank of superintendent, it is subject to review by a superintendent; (iv) after the authorisation is over, the operation should be evaluated, in terms of whether its objectives were met, numbers of searches, number of arrests, number of weapons seized, disproportionality etc, and community confidence and reassurance.
Third, as to the actual encounter on the street: (i) the officer must be in uniform and identify himself by name and police station to the person stopped; (ii) the officer must explain the power under which he is acting, the object of the search and why he is doing it; (iii) the officer must record this in writing; (iv) the person searched is entitled to a copy of the form; (v) the purpose is limited to searching for offensive weapons or dangerous implements.
All of these requirements, in particular to give reasons both for the authorisation and for the stop, should make it possible to judge whether the action was necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime.
No system of safeguards in the world can guarantee that no one will ever act unlawfully or contrary to orders.
If they do so act, the individual will have a remedy.
The law itself is not to blame for individual shortcomings which it does its best to prevent.
It is not incompatible with the Convention rights.
It would not, therefore, be right to make a declaration of incompatibility in this case.
Neither would it be appropriate to make a declaration that the Guidance current at the time, or now, was inadequate or that this particular search was not in accordance with the law.
We would dismiss this appeal.
","This appeal involves a challenge to the compatibility of the police power contained in s 60 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (s 60), with the right to respect for private life protected by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
S 60 permits a police officer to stop and search any person or vehicle for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments, whether or not he has any grounds for suspecting that the person or vehicle is carrying them, when an authorisation from a senior police officer, which must be limited in time and place, is in force.
On 9 September 2010, in response to a period of gang related violence in Haringey, Superintendent Barclay authorised the carrying out of searches under s 60 for 17 hours in parts of the borough, concluding that it was a proportionate response to protect members of the public from serious violence.
That day, Police Constable Jacqui Reid was called to an incident in Tottenham involving a passenger who had not paid her fare on the no. 149 bus.
The passenger was the appellant, Mrs Roberts.
She had denied having identification with her and kept a tight hold on her bag.
PC Reid used the power under s 60 to search her bag, which enabled Mrs Roberts name to be established from a bank card.
Mrs Roberts brought judicial review proceedings against the police alleging breaches of a number of her rights under the ECHR.
Both the High Court and Court of Appeal rejected her claims.
The only claim pursued in her appeal to the Supreme Court was the alleged breach of article 8.
She sought a declaration of incompatibility under s 4 Human Rights Act 1998 on the ground that the power is not in accordance with the law.
Article 8 requires the law to be sufficiently accessible and foreseeable for an individual to regulate his conduct accordingly and to have sufficient safeguards against the risk that it will be used in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Mrs Roberts appeal, holding that the safeguards attending the use of the s 60 power, in particular the requirements to give reasons both for the authorisation and for the stop and search, make it possible to judge whether the power has been exercised lawfully.
Both the power and the particular search of Mrs Roberts were in accordance with the law.
Lady Hale and Lord Reed give the only substantive judgment with which the other justices agree.
The power found in s 60 is one of the few instances where Parliament has decided that stop and search powers without reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of an offence are necessary for the protection of the public from terrorism or serious crime.
It was common ground in the appeal that the power interferes with the right to respect for private life but that it pursues a legitimate aim which is capable of justification under article 8(2).
The issue was whether it also satisfied article 8(2) by being in accordance with the law [3].
S 60 is directed towards the risk of violence involving knives and other offensive weapons in a particular locality.
It depends on an authorisation by an officer of the rank of inspector or above, who reasonably believes that incidents involving serious violence may take place in any locality in his police area, and that an authorisation of up to 24 hours (renewable once) is expedient to prevent their occurrence by allowing stops and searches in order to discover offensive weapons.
The exercise of the powers is subject to numerous safeguards and restrictions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Code of Practice and the Standard Operating Procedures of the Metropolitan Police.
Failure to comply with these safeguards renders the exercise of compulsory powers which interfere with individual freedom unlawful [7, 28 37].
The authorisation made on 9 September 2010 followed police intelligence reports indicating a risk of further violence in connection with rival gangs.
When PC Reid attended the incident she considered that the appellant was holding her bag in a suspicious manner, and her experience was that it was not uncommon for women of a similar age to carry weapons for other people.
She therefore conducted a search of the appellants bag exercising the s 60 power, and provided the appellant with a form explaining these reasons [10 13].
This is the first challenge to the s 60 power to come before the court.
Previous case law concerning similar stop and search powers establishes that some but not every suspicion less power would fail the requirement of lawfulness under the ECHR.
It is often important to the effectiveness of the powers that they be exercised randomly and unpredictably.
The question is whether the legal framework permits the court to examine the propriety of the exercise of the power [15 26].
Whatever the scope of the power, it must be operated in a manner which is compatible with the ECHR rights of any individual and be free of discrimination [42].
These constraints, together with disciplinary sanctions against police officers, guard against the risk that the s 60 power will be exercised when the officer does not in fact have good reasons for the decision [43].
The requirements attaching to the authorisation [44], the operation [45] and the actual encounter on the street [46], in particular the requirement to give reasons, should make it possible to judge whether the action was necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder or crime.
The law itself is not incompatible with article 8 [47].
Accordingly, a declaration under the Human Rights Act should not be made.
Nor should there be a declaration that the guidance current at the time was inadequate or that the particular search of the appellant was not in accordance with the law [48].
"
uksc-2013-0036,"This appeal concerns the liability for Value Added Tax (VAT) of a company which markets and arranges holiday accommodation through an on line website.
The outcome turns on the appropriate characterisation of the relationship between the company, the operators of the hotels, and the holiday makers or their travel agents (which is an English law issue), and the impact of certain provisions of the relevant EU Directive on that relationship once it has been characterised (which is an EU law issue).
The basic facts
The appellant, Secret Hotels2 Ltd (formerly called Med Hotels Ltd, and known as Med), marketed holiday accommodation, consisting of around 2,500 resort hotels, villas, and apartments in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean, through a website, www.medhotels.com (the website).
In these proceedings, everyone has focussed on hotel rooms, and has ignored villas and apartments, and I shall do the same.
Around 94% of the sales of hotel rooms from the website were made to travel agents who no doubt sold them on to holiday makers; the remainder of the sales were directly to holiday makers.
An hotelier who wished his hotel to be marketed by Med had to enter into a written agreement with Med headed global hotels Terms and Conditions for allotment contracts, which I will call the Accommodation Agreement.
Once an hotelier had signed up to the Accommodation Agreement, his hotel would normally be included among those shown on the website.
When a potential customer (be it travel agent or holiday maker) logged onto the website, she would see some Terms of Use.
If, after considering what was available, she identified a hotel at which she (or a client) wished to stay, she would book a holiday through a form on the website, which set out standard Booking Conditions, which included, of course, terms as to payment.
The customer had to pay the whole of the sum which she had agreed with Med to pay for the holiday (which I will call the gross sum) before the holiday maker arrived at the hotel.
However, Med only paid the hotel a lower sum (which I will call the net sum) in respect of the holiday concerned, pursuant to an invoice which was rendered by the hotelier when the holiday had ended.
The relevant VAT law
These proceedings concern Meds liability to VAT in respect of the supply of hotel accommodation through the medium of the website between the period between December 2004 and May 2007 (the relevant period).
VAT is, of course, an EU tax, which is levied on the supply of goods or services.
For the majority of the relevant period, the primary source of law on VAT was contained in Directive 77/388/EEC (the Sixth Directive), but on 1 January 2007 it was replaced by Directive 2006/112/EC (the Principal VAT Directive).
As the two Directives contain effectively identical, although somewhat differently worded, provisions for present purposes, I will limit my references to the current one, and all references to articles are to articles of that Directive, unless stated otherwise.
By article 2.1(c), VAT is liable to be levied on the supply of goods for consideration within the territory of a Member State by a taxable person acting as such.
By virtue of article 135(2)(a), while leasing of property is exempt from VAT, the provision of accommodation in the hotel sector or in sectors with a similar function is not.
Article 45 states that The place of the supply of services connected with immovable property shall be the place where the property is located .
The application of article 45 to travel agents could often result in their having to be registered in many member states, which could be inconvenient both for travel agents and for member states taxing authorities.
Accordingly, articles 306 310 contain a special scheme relating to travel agents.
Article 306, which is the crucial provision for present purposes, is in these terms (albeit adding sub paragraphs to para 1): Article 306 1. [(a)] Member States shall apply a special VAT scheme, in accordance with this Chapter, to transactions carried out by travel agents who deal with customers in their own name and use supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons, in the provision of travel facilities. [(b)] This special scheme shall not apply to travel agents where they act solely as intermediaries and to whom point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 79 applies for the purposes of calculating the taxable amount. 2.
For the purposes of this Chapter, tour operators shall be regarded as travel agents.
Article 79(c) excludes from liability to VAT the amounts received by a taxable person from the customer, as repayment of expenditure entered in his books in a suspense account.
Articles 307 and 308 are also of some relevance, and (with the paragraph numbering added to article 307) they provide as follows: Article 307 1.
Transactions made, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 306, by the travel agent in respect of a journey shall be regarded as a single service supplied by the travel agent to the traveller. 2.
The single service shall be taxable in the Member State in which the travel agent has established his business or has a fixed establishment from which the travel agent has carried out the supply of services.
Article 308 The taxable amount and the price exclusive of VAT, within the meaning of point (8) of Article 226, in respect of the single service provided by the travel agent shall be the travel agent's margin, that is to say, the difference between the total amount, exclusive of VAT, to be paid by the traveller and the actual cost to the travel agent of supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons, where those transactions are for the direct benefit of the traveller.
Provisions equivalent to articles 306 310 were contained in article 26 of the Sixth Directive (which was slightly different in both wording and layout, but identical in its central provisions and effect).
They were given effect in the United Kingdom through the Tour Operators Margin Scheme (known as TOMS), which was promulgated in the Value Added Tax (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (SI 1987/1806).
It is unnecessary to set out the provisions of TOMS as it has never been suggested that they have any different effect from articles 306 310.
The contentions of the parties in summary
HM Commissioners for Revenue and Customs (the Commissioners) assessed Med for VAT in respect of the relevant period on the basis that TOMS applied.
The Commissioners justified this on the ground that Med was a travel agent within the meaning of article 306, which deal[t] with customers [namely travel agents and, less frequently, holiday makers directly] in [its] own name and use[d] the services of other taxable persons [namely the hoteliers] in the provision of travel facilities.
In effect, the Commissioners analysis was that Med booked a room in a hotel for the net sum, which it paid to the hotelier when the holiday had ended, and Med supplied the room to its customer in return for the gross sum, which it received in advance of the holiday.
On that basis, it is agreed that Med would be a travel agent whose operations fell within article 306.1(a), and it would therefore be liable for VAT in accordance with article 307.1, namely on the gross sum paid by the customer to Med.
Further, by virtue of article 307.2, the VAT would be levied in the UK, as that was Meds place of business.
On the Commissioners approach, therefore, where a customer had booked and paid for a holiday in Greece, by virtue of articles 306 and 307, as enacted through TOMS, Med would be liable to the Commissioners for VAT on the margin.
Med challenged this assessment on the ground that the nature of its business was such that it did not fall within article 306.1(a), but within article 306.1(b).
This was on the basis that it was, during the relevant period, a travel agent which was act[ing] solely as [an] intermediar[y]. (Although article 306.1(b) also contains a requirement that point (c) of the first paragraph of article 79 must appl[y] for the purposes of calculating the taxable amount, it is common ground that it would so apply if Med was act[ing] solely as [an] intermediar[y].) Meds analysis of the position was that, through Meds agency, the hotelier supplied a hotel room to a customer for the gross sum, and that Med was entitled to the difference between the gross sum and the net sum as a commission from the hotelier for acting as his agent.
On Meds approach, TOMS would not apply, and it is agreed that the difference between the gross sum and the net sum would be Meds commission for providing services to the hotelier, who was entitled to the gross sum from the customer.
On that basis, the prima facie position would be as follows: (i) Med would have to register for VAT in Greece, (ii) it would have to pay VAT to the Greek taxation authorities on its commission, (iii) the hotelier would have to account for VAT on the gross sum, but (iv) the hotelier would be able to set off against its liability for that VAT, the input tax on the commission.
However, by virtue of regulation 14(2) of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/2518), there was an alternative way of accounting for VAT if Meds analysis was correct and TOMS did not apply, namely the so called reverse charge procedure.
Under this procedure, provided for in article 194, the hotelier would account for the VAT on the gross sum to the Greek authorities, so that Med would not have to pay any VAT.
The procedural history
The Commissioners analysis based on TOMS resulted in their assessing Med to liability for VAT in respect of the relevant period in the sum of 5,643,736.
Med challenged this assessment, but its challenge was rejected by the First Tier Tribunal (FTT, Miss J C Gort and Mr A McLoughlin) after a four day hearing in a carefully reasoned judgment [2010] UKFTT 120 (TC).
The FTT identified the main issue as being: Does [Med] act as a principal, as the Commissioners allege, or as an agent, as [Med] contends, when making the supplies of hotel accommodation? It is common ground that if the Commissioners are correct then [Med] is in principle required to account for output tax under the TOMS and if [Med] is correct then the supplies are treated as taking place in the jurisdiction in which the hotel belongs (and are, therefore, outside the scope of UK VAT).
The FTT answered that question in favour of the Commissioners.
In arriving at this conclusion, they took into account both the contractual documentation and the way in which Meds business was conducted.
They considered that the principal document for our consideration is the contract between [Med] and the hotel.
After taking into account the way in which Med conducted its business, the FTT concluded that the document as a whole was not consistent with the notion that Med was the agent and the hotel the principal.
Accordingly, the FTT dismissed Meds appeal.
Med appealed against that decision to the Upper Tribunal, where its appeal was allowed by Morgan J [2011] UKUT 308 (TCC).
He made the point that the agreed issue as identified by the FTT (see para 14 above) was not entirely satisfactory, as a result of which the issue was reformulated in these terms by the parties: whether the [FTT] was entitled to find (as a matter of law and fact) that [Med] was supplying accommodation services as principal, in which case it was required to account for VAT in the United Kingdom, or whether it should have found that [Med] was acting as agent for a disclosed principal, in which case the supplies of accommodation services fell to be treated as made in the jurisdiction in which the hotel was situated and so do not give rise to any liability to VAT in the United Kingdom.
Morgan J considered that the FTT should not have addressed the issue by simply considering only part of the contractual documentation together with the way in which Med conducted its business.
Rather, they should have started by assessing the effect of the totality of the contractual documentation, and only then asked themselves whether their assessment was altered by the way in which Med conducted its business.
He approached the issue on that basis, and first decided that (i) the contractual arrangements between Med and the customers established that Med was contracting as agent for the hotelier, and (ii) the contractual arrangements between Med and the hoteliers were consistent with that conclusion.
He then turned to various factors which impressed the FTT as to the way in which Med carried on business, and decided that none of those facts justified rejecting the view that Med was an agent acting for a disclosed principal.
Morgan Js decision was appealed by the Commissioners to the Court of Appeal, who allowed their appeal for reasons given in a judgment by Sir John Chadwick, with which Ward and McFarlane LJJ agreed [2012] EWCA Civ 1571.
They held that Morgan J was wrong to criticise the FTT for looking at the whole facts of the case as opposed to concentrating on the contractual documentation.
They also held that the FTT was plainly entitled to reach the conclusion that they did, in the light of the contractual documentation and the way in which Med conducted its business.
At the end of his judgment, Sir John identified a number of aspects of the way in which Med conducted its business which he regarded as being of particular weight in justifying the conclusion that it was a principal rather than an agent in terms of supplying hotel rooms to customers.
Med now appeals to this Court.
Overview of the issues
The outcome of this appeal ultimately turns on the question whether Meds activities in relation to the provision of hotel rooms to customers fell within article 306.1(a) or article 306.1(b).
That question must be decided by the proper application of the provisions of article 306 to the circumstances of this case.
Once the appropriate tribunal has identified and applied the relevant legal principles, it is ultimately a question of fact for that tribunal whether a travel agent falls within para 306.1(a) or para 306.1(b).
Accordingly, as the Court of Appeal held, it would only have been open to Morgan J to reverse the FTTs decision if (i) they had wrongly analysed the law, ie if they had been wrong in their view as to legal effect of the contractual relations and subsequent facts, or had wrongly interpreted or applied article 306, or (ii) the FTT had reached a conclusion which no reasonable tribunal could have reached.
So far as the law is concerned, what article 306 means and how it is to be applied is a matter of EU law, a topic on which the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Community, the CJEU, are binding on national courts see eg Customs and Excise Commissioners v Madgett and Baldwin (Joined cases C 308/96 and C 94/97) [1998] STC 1189.
That case decided that the predecessor of article 306 applied not just to travel agents, but to all traders who habitually arrange travel or tours and, in order to supply the services generally associated with activities of that kind, have recourse to other taxable persons see para AG33.
However, in so far as the provisions of article 306 depend upon the precise nature and character of the contractual relationship between two or more parties, that issue must be determined by reference to the proper law of the contract or contracts concerned, and, in so far as the subsequent conduct of the parties is said to affect that nature and character, the effect must also be assessed by reference to the proper law of the contract or contracts.
In that connection, it is worth referring to the observation of the CJEU in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v RBS Deutschland Holdings GmbH (Case C 277/09) [2011] STC 345, para 53, that taxable persons are generally free to choose the organisational structures and the form of transactions which they consider to be most appropriate for their economic activities and for the purposes of limiting their tax burdens, albeit that this is subject to an exception for abusive transactions as discussed in Halifax plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners (Case C 255/02) [2006] Ch 387.
The correct approach to article 306
Article 306.1 postulates two categories of travel agent, namely (a) those who deal with customers in their own name and use supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons, in the provision of travel facilities, and (b) those who act solely as intermediaries.
The parties were agreed that the two categories were mutually exclusive, but also that, taken together, they were comprehensive in the sense that a travel agent arranging accommodation for a customer must fall within one of the two categories.
It may be that the proper analysis is that advanced by Lord Sumption during the hearing, namely that a travel agent can only be within article 306 if it falls within category (a), but it would be taken out of the article if it also falls within category (b).
However, it is unnecessary to decide whether that is right, at least for present purposes.
So far as the meaning of in their own name is concerned, some useful guidance was given by the CJEU in relation to the expression in a case concerned with the provisions in the Sixth Directive relating to an operator who received bets, arguably on behalf of a bookmaker.
In Belgium v Henfling (Case C 464/10) [2011] STC 1851, para 33, the CJEU said that involvement in his own name means that a legal relationship is brought about not directly between the better and the undertaking on behalf of which the operator involved acts, but between that operator and the better, on the one hand, and between that operator and that undertaking, on the other.
There appears to be no case in the CJEU where the meaning of the word intermediaries has been considered.
However, it would seem at any rate in most cases to be the equivalent of agents in English law, although both parties were (rightly in my view) inclined to accept that it had a wider meaning than agents.
In particular, it was not suggested to be a term of article
The CJEU has given guidance as to the proper approach to be adopted in a case such as the present.
In Beheersmaatschappij Van Ginkel Waddinxveen BV v Inspecteur der Omzetbelasting, Utrecht (Case C 163/91) [1996] STC 825, para 21, the court said that the predecessor of article 306.1(a) in the Sixth Directive: makes the application of that article subject to the condition that the travel agent shall deal with customers in his own name and not as an intermediary.
It is for the national court before which a dispute concerning the application of these provisions is brought to inquire, having regard to all the details of the case, and in particular the nature of the travel agent's contractual obligations towards the traveller, whether or not that condition is met.
The point was taken a little further in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Newey (Case C 653/11) [2013] STC 2432, where the CJEU said this, reflecting what it had said in a number of earlier decisions: 42.
As regards in particular the importance of contractual terms in categorising a transaction as a taxable transaction, it is necessary to bear in mind the case law of the court according to which consideration of economic and commercial realities is a fundamental criterion for the application of the common system of VAT . 43.
Given that the contractual position normally reflects the economic and commercial reality of the transactions and in order to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty, the relevant contractual terms constitute a factor to be taken into consideration when the supplier and the recipient in a supply of services transaction within the meaning of articles 2(1) and 6(1) of the Sixth Directive have to be identified. 44.
It may, however, become apparent that, sometimes, certain contractual terms do not wholly reflect the economic and commercial reality of the transactions. 45.
That is the case in particular if it becomes apparent that those contractual terms constitute a purely artificial arrangement which does not correspond with the economic and commercial reality of the transactions.
Where the question at issue involves more than one contractual arrangement between different parties, this Court has emphasised that, when assessing the issue of who supplies what services to whom for VAT purposes, regard must be had to all the circumstances in which the transaction or combination of transactions takes place per Lord Reed in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Aimia Coalition Loyalty UK Ltd [2013] 2 All ER 719, para 38.
As he went on to explain, this requires the whole of the relationships between the various parties being considered.
The correct approach in domestic law
Where parties have entered into a written agreement which appears on its face to be intended to govern the relationship between them, then, in order to determine the legal and commercial nature of that relationship, it is necessary to interpret the agreement in order to identify the parties respective rights and obligations, unless it is established that it constitutes a sham.
When interpreting an agreement, the court must have regard to the words used, to the provisions of the agreement as whole, to the surrounding circumstances in so far as they were known to both parties, and to commercial common sense.
When deciding on the categorisation of a relationship governed by a written agreement, the label or labels which the parties have used to describe their relationship cannot be conclusive, and may often be of little weight.
As Lewison J said in A1 Lofts Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2010] STC 214, para 40, in a passage cited by Morgan J: The court is often called upon to decide whether a written contract falls within a particular legal description.
In so doing the court will identify the rights and obligations of the parties as a matter of construction of the written agreement; but it will then go on to consider whether those obligations fall within the relevant legal description.
Thus the question may be whether those rights and obligations are properly characterised as a licence or tenancy (as in Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809); or as a fixed or floating charge (as in Agnew v IRC [2001] 2 AC 710), or as a consumer hire agreement (as in TRM Copy Centres (UK) Ltd v Lanwall Services Ltd [2009] 1 WLR 1375).
In all these cases the starting point is to identify the legal rights and obligations of the parties as a matter of contract before going on to classify them.
In English law it is not permissible to take into account the subsequent behaviour or statements of the parties as an aid to interpreting their written agreement see FL Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1974] AC 235.
The subsequent behaviour or statements of the parties can, however, be relevant, for a number of other reasons.
First, they may be invoked to support the contention that the written agreement was a sham ie that it was not in fact intended to govern the parties relationship at all.
Secondly, they may be invoked in support of a claim for rectification of the written agreement.
Thirdly, they may be relied on to support a claim that the written agreement was subsequently varied, or rescinded and replaced by a subsequent contract (agreed by words or conduct).
Fourthly, they may be relied on to establish that the written agreement represented only part of the totality of the parties contractual relationship.
In the present proceedings, it has never been suggested that the written agreements between Med and hoteliers, namely the Accommodation Agreements, were a sham or liable to rectification.
Nor has it been suggested that the terms contained on the website (the website terms), which governed the relationship between Med and the customers, namely the Terms of Use and the Booking Conditions, were a sham or liable to rectification.
In these circumstances, it appears to me that (i) the right starting point is to characterise the nature of the relationship between Med, the customer, and the hotel, in the light of the Accommodation Agreement and the website terms (the contractual documentation), (ii) one must next consider whether that characterisation can be said to represent the economic reality of the relationship in the light of any relevant facts, and (iii) if so, the final issue is the result of this characterisation so far as article 306 is concerned.
This is a slightly more sophisticated analysis than the single issue as it has been agreed between the parties, as set out in para 16 above, but, as will become apparent, at least in the circumstances of this case, it amounts to the same thing.
In order to decide whether the FTT was entitled to reach the conclusion that it did, one must identify the nature of the relationship between Med, the hotelier, and the customer, and, in order to do that, one must first consider the effect of the contractual documentation, and then see whether any conclusion is vitiated by the facts relied on by either party.
The effect of the documentation
The provisions of the contractual documentation were set out extensively in the Tribunal decisions below see paras 27 36 of the FTTs decision, and paras 10 40 of Morgan Js decision.
In my view, both the Accommodation Agreement and the website terms make it clear that, both as between Med and the hotelier, and as between Med and the customer, the hotel room is provided by the hotelier to the customer through the agency of Med, and the customer pays the gross sum to the hotelier, on the basis that the amount by which it exceeds the net sum is to be Meds commission as agent.
Turning first to the Accommodation Agreement, it begins by identifying the hotelier as the Principal and Med as the Agent, and goes on to provide that, for a specified season, certain types (and sometimes certain numbers) of rooms in the hotel will be available at certain rates (which are what I have called the net sums), as set out in an attached rate sheet.
The Accommodation Agreement then states that the Principal hereby appoints the Agent as its selling agent and the Agent agrees to act as such.
It immediately goes on to provide that the Agent agrees to deal accurately with the requests for accommodation bookings and relay all monies which it receives from the Principals Clients (Clients) which are due to the Principal.
The Agreement also states that it is to be construed in accordance with English law and that the English courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
Subject to the other provisions of the Accommodation Agreement showing otherwise, the nature of the intended relationship appears to be quite clear.
Med is to be the hoteliers agent for the purpose of marketing rooms in the hotel, and Clients, or customers as I have called them, will book rooms through the agency of Med directly with the hotelier.
The Commissioners rely on four aspects of the Accommodation Agreement to justify the contention that it is not in fact an agency arrangement, but that, in truth, it envisages that Med will book rooms itself, with a view to sub booking them on to customers.
First, there is the basic financial arrangement under which Med was entitled to receive a commission calculated as any sum charged to a Client by the Agent which is over and above the prices set out in the rate sheet.
Secondly, some of the financial provisions are said to be inconsistent with agency relationship.
Thirdly, it is said that the terms of the Accommodation Agreement include provisions which indicate that Meds interest is wider than that of a mere agent such as covenants by the hotelier to honour customers bookings, to insure the hotel against a number of risks, to keep the hotel clean, and to permit Meds representative to inspect the hotel.
Fourthly, the Accommodation Agreement was very one sided, in that it contained no express obligations on Med beyond those in the opening provision quoted in para 38 above, not even an obligation to promote the hotel, whereas there were many obligations imposed on the hotelier.
I am unimpressed with these points.
They all stem from, and reflect, the fact that Med had a substantial business based on the website (as is evidenced by Meds turnover, the number of hotels for which it had an exclusive agency, and the fact that it was a member of a large group of companies including lastminute.com).
This in turn means that it had built up a substantial goodwill in the holiday making market which it wished to protect, and that it was in a much more powerful negotiating position than the hoteliers with which it was contracting.
More specifically, there is no reason why an agent should not be able to fix its own commission.
It is common for agents acting in the sale of financial products, eg many types of insurance policies, to do so, and it has been specifically held to be an arrangement which is consistent with agency see Mercantile International Group plc v Chuan Soon Huat Industrial Group Ltd [2002] 1 All ER (Comm) 788.
As to the other financial terms, it is true that the hotelier was obliged to compensate Med for its losses (including loss of commission) if it did not provide the accommodation it had agreed to provide to a customer, and that Med was entitled to retain the equivalent of the last 100 bed overnights as a guarantee to cover marketing costs for the next season.
I do not see why such provisions are inconsistent with a principal and agent relationship: all they did was to reflect the relative negotiating positions of the parties.
The fact that the hotelier agreed to do things which would be of benefit to people staying in the hotel is easily explained by the point that Med was anxious to maintain its goodwill among holiday makers and travel agents, and was in a strong enough bargaining position to impose such terms on the hotelier.
Turning to the website terms, the Terms of Use explained that Med provides information concerning the price and availability of hotels and that [a]ny reservations you make on this site will be directly with the company whose hotel services you are booking.
They also emphasised that Med acts as agent only for each of the hotels to provide you with information on the hotels and an on line reservation service.
As for the Booking Conditions, they began by stating that Med act[s] as booking agents on behalf of all the hotels featured on this website and your contract will be made with these accommodation providers.
They also stated that [o]nce the contract is made, the accommodation provider is responsible to you to provide you with what you have booked and you are responsible to pay for it.
The Booking Conditions also explained that [b]ecause [Med is] acting only as a booking agent, it has no liability for any of the accommodation arrangements.
The Booking Conditions also provide that they are governed by English law and that any dispute is to be determined by the English courts.
The Commissioners point to one or two provisions of the Booking Conditions which, they say, are inconsistent with the notion that Med was only acting as the hoteliers agent rather than as a principal.
First, if a customer (i) made a change to a booking or (ii) cancelled a booking, she was liable to pay to Med (i) an administration charge of 15, or (ii) a cancellation charge, whose quantum depended on how late the cancellation occurred, and in neither case did it appear that the charge was passed on to the hotelier.
Secondly, if the hotelier was unable to provide the room as booked, Med agreed to try to provide [the customer] with similar accommodation of equal standard, but if this was not possible, Med would allow a cancellation free of charge.
I do not consider that either of these points undermine the conclusion that Med was acting as the hoteliers agent.
The failure to account for the administration charge is irrelevant; there is no reason to think that it did not reflect the genuine cost to Med.
The failure to account for the cancellation charge, the no show forfeit, and the interest on the deposits is more striking.
As a matter of law, these sums would have been payable to the hotelier, but the fact that they were not so paid represents a breach of the agency arrangement on the part of Med or an accepted variation of the Accommodation Agreement, either of which would merely have reflected the relative bargaining positions of Med and the hotelier, and did not alter the nature of the relationship of the arrangement between Med, the hotelier and the customer.
As to Meds obligation to try to provide alternative accommodation, it is clear, as a matter of interpretation, that the obligation could, and no doubt in practice would, have involved Med procuring the provision of accommodation by another hotelier; in any event, the obligation was clearly included to protect Meds goodwill.
The factors relied on by the FTT and the Court of Appeal
Having decided that the effect of the contractual documentation between hoteliers, Med, and customers is that Med marketed and sold hotel accommodation to customers as the agent of the hoteliers, I turn to consider the characteristics of the way in which Med conducted its business which persuaded the FTT and the Court of Appeal that Med in fact marketed and sold the hotel accommodation to customers as a principal.
At the end of his judgment, Sir John Chadwick summarised the main factors as follows (with the addition of subparagraphs and adaptations to reflect the terminology adopted in this judgment): (1) Med dealt with customers in its own name (a) in respect of the use of its website and (b) in the services of its local handling agents. (2) Med dealt with customers in its own name (and not as intermediary) in those cases where the hotel operator was unable to provide accommodation as booked and the customer rejected the alternative accommodation offered. (3) Med dealt with matters of complaint and compensation in its own name and without reference to the hotelier. (4) Med used the services of other taxable persons (the hoteliers) in the provision of the travel facilities marketed through its website. (5) In relation to VAT, Med dealt with hoteliers in other Member States in a manner inconsistent with the relationship of principal and agent.
In particular, Med did not provide the hoteliers with invoices in respect of its commission (nor even notify the hoteliers of the amount of that commission); so making it impossible for the hoteliers to comply with their obligations to account to the tax authorities of that Member State in accordance with the Principal VAT Directive. (6)(a) Med treated deposits and other monies which it received from customers and their agents as its own monies.
It did not account to the hoteliers for those monies. (b) It did not enter those monies in a suspense account so as to take advantage of article 79(c); and so cannot rely on the exclusion from the scope of article 306.1(b).
The Commissioners also rely on the points that (7) hoteliers would invoice Med for the net sum in respect of each customer at the end of the relevant holiday, and (8) Med reserved a number of rooms, and sometimes specific rooms, in many hotels for which it paid the net sum in advance.
There is nothing in factor (1)(a): until a customer selected a particular hotel on the website, Med had to deal with the customer in its own name, but that does nothing to undermine the point that, once a hotel was selected, Med acted as the hoteliers agent.
As to factor 1(b), it is true that Med appointed its own local agents to look after holiday makers, but that was not inconsistent with its status as an agent of the hotelier, and is easily explicable by reference to Meds need to maintain goodwill in the holidaymaking market.
The Commissioners relied on some of the terms of Meds standard form Handling Agency Agreement, but they take matters no further.
Factor (2) is of no assistance: I have already discussed it at para 44 above.
Factor (3) is correct, and can be said to be contrary to one of the terms of the contractual documentation, which envisage a customer sorting out complaints with the hotelier.
However, particularly given that (i) Med recovered from the hotelier any compensation which it negotiated and paid to a holiday maker and (ii) Meds activities in this connection were not inherently inconsistent with its status as the hoteliers agent (albeit an agent in a strong bargaining position), the departure from the contractual terms was not of significance for present purposes.
Factor (4) takes matters no further either.
As to factor (5), it is quite true that Med failed to provide the hoteliers with the information necessary to enable them to provide proper VAT returns, and that it failed to account for VAT as it should have done if it had been the hoteliers agent as it contends.
It is also true that this can be said to represent some sort of indication that the arrangements were not as the contractual documentation suggests.
However, not only is it not a very strong point in itself, but, as Morgan J said, while Med did not account for VAT in accordance with its contentions as to the legal position, it did not account for VAT in accordance with the Commissioners contentions as to the legal position either.
Factor (6)(a) is of no assistance, and my remarks about the cancellation charge in para 44 above apply.
Factor (6)(b) is merely an aspect of factor (5).
As to factor (7), if Med was an agent as it contends, one would have expected the hoteliers invoices to have been for the gross sums with a deduction for Meds commission, and the fact that they were for the net sums is consistent with the Commissioners analysis.
However, the invoices are not financially inconsistent with the contractual arrangements contended for by Med, as the hotelier would expect Med to pay the net sum, not the gross sum.
In any event, at least on their own, such invoices cannot change the nature of the contractual arrangements between Med, the customer and the hotelier, given that (i) they post date not merely the contracts but their performance, and (ii) the customer was not aware of the invoices, so it is hard to see how they could affect her contractual rights or obligations.
As to factor (8), it seems to me that there is nothing inconsistent in terms of logic or law in Med reserving a hotel room in its own name in anticipation of subsequently offering it on the market, on the basis that a customer who booked the room would not contract with Med, but would contract through Med with the hotelier.
The purpose of Med reserving rooms in this way is obvious, namely to maximise its opportunity to earn commission and to maintain or improve its goodwill with potential customers.
The fact that Med had to pay for the rooms it reserved is unsurprising, but such payments were always recoverable, in that, if there were insufficient bookings by customers at the hotel for the season in question, the amount paid by Med was carried forward to the next season.
Of course, Med ran a risk of losing its money, but that fact does not undermine the notion that Med acted as an agent.
The Commissioners contend that the factors identified in para 45 above justify the conclusion that the agency arrangement was somehow varied by the parties conduct, and in particular the conduct of Med, as the commercially dominant party, so that it became the person providing the customers with hotel rooms, as opposed to the agent of the hoteliers who provided the rooms.
It is unnecessary to address the question of how such a contention might be analysed in legal terms, because, for the reasons given in paras 46 49 above, those factors, even taken together, are not inconsistent with, and therefore cannot undermine, the existence and nature of the agency arrangement.
The decisions below
The decision of the FTT cannot stand, as they appear to have held that, after taking into account the way in which Med conducted its business, the true effect of the written contractual arrangements between Med and the hoteliers was not that Med was an agent through whom the hotelier provided the customer with a room, but that the hotelier provided Med with a room which Med then provided on to the customer.
For the reasons I have given, that analysis is unsustainable.
The decision of Morgan J to the contrary effect was right, and I shall consider his conclusion further in the next section of this judgment.
Given that the FTT was wrong in its legal analysis of the relationship between Med, hoteliers and customers, the Court of Appeals decision, which was based on the conclusion that the FTT adopted a permissible approach, cannot stand.
In these circumstances, as Morgan J was right to reverse the FTTs decision, and analysed the legal relationship between Med, the hoteliers and customers correctly, we should uphold his conclusion, unless we consider that he then went wrong in relation to the question of the application of article 306 to the facts of this case, an issue to which I now turn.
If he did go wrong, then we should, if possible, resolve that question ourselves.
The application of article 306 to the facts of this case
Given that I have concluded [Med] was acting as agent for a disclosed principal, the consequence according to the agreed reformulated issue (set out in para 16 above) would appear to be that the supplies of accommodation services fell to be treated as made in the jurisdiction in which the hotel was situated and so do not give rise to any liability to VAT in the United Kingdom.
However, as a matter of principle, it is necessary to address the question whether, as a matter of EU law, the fact that Med was acting as an agent does justify that conclusion.
As explained above, the characterisation of the relationship between Med, customers, and hoteliers is a matter of English law, but the ultimate issue on this appeal is an issue of EU law, namely whether, in the light of that characterisation, Med is liable for VAT as the Commissioners allege, and that issue must be resolved by applying article 306 to the facts of this case, which include the fact that Med is an agent as it contends.
The reformulated issue effectively assumes the correctness of the proposition that, once it is concluded as a matter of English law, that the effect of the contractual documentation and the way in which the parties conducted their relationship was that Med was an agent for the hotelier with whom a customer booked accommodation, as opposed to a principal who booked accommodation with the hotelier and then booked it on to a customer, Med fell within article 306.1(b), rather than article 306.1(a).
That is not an assumption which can safely be made in every case, but it seems to me that in the general run of cases, such a proposition will be correct.
It seems to me clear from the guidance given by the CJEU in Henfling (quoted in para 26 above) that the concepts of an intermediary and an agent are similar, as are the concepts of a person dealing in his own name and a principal.
Furthermore, the CJEUs suggested approach as to how the issue should be determined seems very similar to that of the English court.
I have in mind what was said in Van Ginkel and Newey (quoted in paras 28 and 29 above), namely that the travel agents contractual obligations towards the traveller are of particular importance in deciding whether article 306.1(a) or article 306.1(b) applies, but it is also necessary to hav[e] regard to all the details of the case, and, in that connection, the economic and commercial realities represent a fundamental criterion.
A contract which does not reflect economic reality and a purely artificial arrangement are similar to the shams, rectifiable agreements and other arrangements considered in para 33 above.
Thus, in deciding whether article 306.1(a) or article 306.1(b) applies, the approach laid down by the CJEU in order to decide whether a person such as Med is an intermediary is very similar to the approach which is applied in English law in order to determine whether Med was an agent, ie the very exercise undertaken in paras 31 50 above.
One starts with the written contract between Med and the customer, as it is the customer to whom the ultimate supply is made.
However, one must also consider the written contract between Med and the hotelier, as there would be a strong case for saying that, even if Med was the hoteliers agent as between it and the customer, Med should nonetheless be treated as the supplier as principal (in English law) or in its own name (in EU law) if, as between the hotelier and Med, the hotel room was supplied to Med.
For the reasons set out in paras 36 44 above, I consider that the contractual documentation supports the notion that Med was an intermediary, and, in the light of the discussion in paras 45 50 above, it seems to me that economic reality does not assist a contrary view.
Further, one aspect of economic reality is that it is the hotelier, not Med, who owns the accommodation and it is the customer, not Med, to whom it is ultimately supplied: that does not, of course, prevent the hotelier supplying the accommodation to Med for supply on to the customer, but it makes it hard to argue that Meds analysis that it is no more than an agent is contrary to economic reality.
Further, one must be careful before stigmatising the contractual documentation as being artificial, bearing in mind that EU law, like English law, treats parties as free to arrange or structure their relationship so as to maximise its commercial attraction, including the incidence of taxation see RBS Deutschland, cited in para 24 above.
As is realistically, if impliedly, acknowledged by the Commissioners (and indeed by Med) in the reformulated agreed issue on this appeal (as set out in para 16 above), once it has been decided that Med was, as it contends, the hoteliers agent in relation to the supply of accommodation to customers as a matter of English law, it follows, at least on the facts of this case, that it was an intermediary for the purpose of article 306.1, and accordingly this appeal must succeed.
It may be that Morgan J was wrong not to go on to consider the EU law issue, but it is scarcely surprising that he did not do so in the light of the agreed formulation of the issue before him.
Indeed, as appears from the discussion in paras 53 57 above, EU law and English law in this case seem to travel along effectively the same lines, and accordingly I consider that Morgan J reached the right conclusion for substantially the right reasons.
Conclusion
I would accordingly allow Meds appeal, discharge the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the order of Morgan J in the Upper Tribunal.
","This appeal concerns the liability for Value Added Tax (VAT) of a company known as Med, which marketed hotel accommodation in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean through a website.
An hotelier who wished his hotel to be marketed by Med had to enter into a written agreement with Med (the Accommodation Agreement).
When a potential customer identified a hotel at which she wished to stay, she would book a holiday through a form on the website, which set out standard booking conditions (the website terms).
The customer had to pay the whole of the sum she agreed with Med to pay for the holiday (the gross sum) before arriving at the hotel.
However, Med only paid the hotel a lower sum (the net sum) for the holiday after it had ended.
VAT is an EU tax levied on the supply of goods or services.
By article 2.1(c) of Directive 2006/112/EC (the Principal VAT Directive) VAT is liable to be levied on the supply of services for consideration within the territory of a Member State by a taxable person acting as such.
Article 45 states that The place of the supply of services connected with immovable propertyshall be the place where the property is located.
The application of article 45 to travel agents could result in their having to be registered in many member states, and so articles 306 310 contain a special scheme relating to travel agents.
Article 306 differentiates between two categories of travel agent, namely (a) those who deal with customers in their own name and use supplies of goods or services provided by other taxable persons, in the provision of travel facilities and (b) those who act solely as intermediaries (referred to for convenience as, respectively, article 306.1(a) and article 306.1(b)), and provides for a special VAT scheme for transactions carried out by travel agents who fall within article 306.1(a).
The Commissioners for Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) assessed Med for VAT on the basis that Med was a travel agent that deals with customers in its own name within the meaning of article 306.1(a).
On that basis, it was agreed that Med would be liable for VAT on the gross sum paid by the customer to Med.
Med challenged this assessment, on the ground that it was a travel agent acting solely as an intermediary within the meaning of article 306.1(b).
On this approach, any VAT would be due to the Greek taxation authorities.
The First Tier Tribunal upheld HMRCs analysis.
Morgan J allowed Meds appeal, but HMRCs subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was successful.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
Lord Neuberger gives the only judgment, with which the rest of the court agrees.
Med was acting as an intermediary rather than in its own name, and so falls within article 306.1(b).
Consequently, the Supreme Court discharges the order of the Court of Appeal and restores the order of Morgan J.
The outcome of this appeal turns on the question whether Meds activities in relation to the provision of hotel rooms to customers fell within article 306.1(a) or article 306.1(b) of the Principal Tax Directive [20].
What article 306 means and how it is to be applied is a matter of EU law, a topic on which the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Community (CJEU) are binding on national courts [22].
However, insofar as the provisions of article 306 depend upon the precise nature and character of the contractual relationship between two or more parties, that issue must be determined by reference to the proper law of the contract or contracts concerned [23].
The domestic law Where parties have entered into a written agreement which appears on its face to be intended to govern the relationship between them, in order to determine the legal and commercial nature of that relationship it is necessary to interpret the agreement in order to identify the parties respective rights and obligations, unless it is established that it constitutes a sham [31].
While it is not possible to take into account the subsequent behaviour or statements of the parties as an aid to interpreting their written agreement, this may be invoked for other reasons: (i) to support the contention that the written agreement was sham; (ii) to support a claim for rectification; (iii) to support a claim that the written agreement was subsequently varied, or rescinded and replaced by a subsequent contract; or (iv) to establish that the written agreement represented only part of the parties contractual relationship [33].
It is not suggested that either the Accommodation Agreement or the website terms is a sham or liable to rectification.
Accordingly, one must start by characterising the nature of the relationship between Med, the customer, and the hotel, in the light of the Accommodation Agreement and the website terms (the contractual documentation).
One must then consider whether this characterisation represents the economic reality of the situation, and, finally, one must determine the result of this characterisation under article 306 [34].
The contractual documentation makes it clear that, both as between Med and the hotelier, and as between Med and the customer, the hotel room is provided by the hotelier to the customer through the agency of Med.
The customer pays the gross sum to the hotelier on the basis that the amount by which it exceeds the net sum is to be Meds commission as agent [36].
None of the provisions of the contractual documentation relied on by HMRC is inconsistent with Med acting as the hoteliers agent: they merely reflect the relative bargaining positions of Med and the hoteliers.
They do not alter the nature of the relationship between Med, the hotelier and the customer [37] [44].
The EU law It is clear from the guidance given by CJEU that the concepts of an intermediary and an agent are similar, as are the concepts of a person dealing in his own name and a principal [55].
In deciding whether article 306.1(a) or 306.1(b) applies, the approach laid down by the CJEU in order to determine whether a person such as Med is an intermediary is very similar to the approach applied in English law to determine whether Med was an agent [56].
For the same reasons that the contractual documentation supports the notion that Med was an agent, it also supports the conclusion that Med was an intermediary, and the economic reality does not assist a contrary view [57].
Once it has been decided that Med was the hoteliers agent in relation to the supply of accommodation to customers as a matter of English law, it follows, at least on the facts of this case, that it was an intermediary for the purpose of article 306.1 [58].
"
uksc-2017-0160,"This appeal raises an interesting but complicated question as to the meaning of the GLA Roads and Side Roads (Transfer of Property etc) Order 2000 (SI 2000/1552) (the Transfer Order) made by the Secretary of State in exercise of powers conferred by section 405 and following of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (the GLA Act).
By that Act Parliament reorganised local government in London and created the Greater London Authority (GLA) under a directly elected Mayor of London.
The GLA performs its strategic transport and road traffic functions through the appellant Transport for London (TfL), which became the highway authority for those public highways in London designated as GLA roads, in the GLA Roads Designation Order 2000 (SI 2000/1117) (the Designation Order).
Previously those highways had been the responsibility of individual London borough councils as local highway authorities including, for their respective areas, the respondents London Borough of Southwark and the City of London Corporation (the Councils).
As its name implies, the Transfer Order provided for the transfer from local highway authorities to TfL of specified property and liabilities relating to highways designated as GLA roads by the Designation Order.
The present dispute concerns, in particular, the meaning of the following provisions in article 2 of the Transfer Order (article 2): (1) Subject to paragraph (2) and article 4 below, on the operative date there are hereby transferred to Transport for London in relation to each GLA road the highway, in so far as it is vested in the former (a) highway authority; (b) on the designation date, it was vested the property mentioned paragraph (3) in so far as, (i) in the former highway authority for the purposes of their highway functions in relation to the GLA road (3) The property referred to in paragraph (1)(b) is (a) land, other than land (i) vested in the former highway authority for the purpose of being used for the storage of material required wholly or mainly for the maintenance and improvement of other highways; (ii) where the former highway authority is a relevant authority, held by that authority for the improvement or development of frontages to the highway, or of land adjoining or adjacent to the highway; .
The dispute arose, and was directed to be determined as a preliminary issue, in an arbitration held under article 8 of the Transfer Order.
At its heart, the appeal is about what is transferred by the words in paragraph (1)(a) of article 2: the highway, in so far as it is vested in the former highway authority.
The question is whether that phrase captures everything which the former authority owns in the vertical plane bounded by the road, which may include all the airspace above and all the subsoil below the surface of the road, or only that part which is necessary for the operation, maintenance and repair of the road, ie a slice of the airspace and a slice of the underlying subsoil.
The Secretary of States drafting team adopted, as their model for article 2, the content of section 265 of the Highways Act 1980 (section 265) which provides for the transfer of property and liabilities upon a highway becoming, or ceasing to be, a trunk road.
Although not part of that Act, article 2 therefore forms part, at least by inheritance, of what counsel fairly described as the rich tapestry of the highways legislation in England and Wales.
In Farrell v Alexander [1977] AC 59, at 73, Lord Wilberforce said: self contained statutes, whether consolidating previous law, or so doing with amendments, should be interpreted, if reasonably possible, without recourse to antecedents, and that the recourse should only be had when there is a real and substantial difficulty or ambiguity which classical methods of construction cannot resolve.
Goodes v East Sussex County Council [2000] 1 WLR 1356 was a case about the Highways Act 1980, and its predecessor, the Highways Act 1959.
After citing Lord Wilberforces well known dictum, Lord Hoffmann continued, at p 1360H: It seems to me quite impossible, in construing the Act of 1959, to shut ones eyes to the fact that it was not a code which sprang fully formed from the legislative head but was built upon centuries of highway law.
The provisions of the Act itself invited reference to the earlier law and in some cases were unintelligible without them.
See also, to much the same effect: Cusack v Harrow London Borough Council [2013] UKSC 40; [2013] 1 WLR 2022, per Lord Carnwath at para 19 and per Lord Neuberger at paras 64 65.
Lord Wilberforces wise words have lost none of their force, in an era which has seen an exponential increase in the complexity of legislation.
It is hard enough on the law abiding public that legislation is often unintelligible without the assistance of skilled lawyers.
It is even worse if its meaning requires, in addition, the assistance of a legal historian.
None the less, this is a case, as were the Goodes and Cusack cases, where neither the analysis of the dispute as to statutory meaning, nor the appropriate solution to it, can be undertaken without substantial recourse to the history of English and Welsh highways law and in particular legislation.
Even the innocent sounding word highway is itself capable of having a range of different meanings, dependent upon the context in which it is used.
The Statutory History
The word highway has no single meaning in the law but, in non technical language, it is a way over which the public have rights of passage, whether on foot, on horseback or in (or on) vehicles.
At common law, at least prior to 1835, there was, generally speaking, no necessary connection between those responsible for the maintenance and repair of a public highway and those with a proprietary interest in the land over which it ran.
Prima facie the inhabitants of the parish through which the highway ran would be responsible for its repair, but they were not a corporate body suitable to hold ownership rights in relation to it: see Sauvain on Highway Law (5th ed, 2013) at para 3 05.
As he puts it: It was left to statute, therefore, to create an interest in land which was to be held by the body on whom the duty to repair had fallen.
Parliament began this task, in a rudimentary way, in section 41 of the Highways Act 1835, continued it in section 68 of the Public Health Act 1848, section 96 of the Metropolis Management Act 1855 and section 149 of the Public Health Act 1875.
They all provided for a form of automatic vesting of a property interest in the land over which the highway ran in favour of the body responsible for its maintenance and repair.
A basic feature of the conveyance or transfer of freehold land by reference to an identified surface area is that, unless the context or the language of the grant otherwise requires or provides (eg by a reservation of minerals), its effect is to vest in the transferee not only the surface of the ground, but the subsoil down (at least in theory) to the centre of the earth and the air space up (at least in theory) into the heavens.
Viewed in the vertical plane, the transferee acquires ownership not only of the slice on the surface but of the whole of the space above it, and the ground below it.
But a series of 19th century cases beginning with Coverdale v Charlton (1878) 4 QBD 104 and culminating in the decision of the House of Lords in Tunbridge Wells Corpn v Baird [1896] AC 434, established that the successive statutory provisions for the automatic vesting of proprietary interests in highways in the bodies responsible for their maintenance and repair operated in a much more limited way than would a simple conveyance or transfer of the freehold.
First, it was a determinable, rather than absolute, fee simple, which would end automatically if the body responsible for its repair ceased to be so responsible (eg if the road ceased to be a public highway): see Rolls v Vestry of St George the Martyr, Southwark (1880) 14 Ch D 785.
Secondly it was inalienable, for so long as that responsibility lasted.
Thirdly, and most importantly for present purposes, statutory vesting conferred ownership only of that slice of the land over which the highway ran, viewed in the vertical plane, as was necessary for its ordinary use, including its repair and maintenance.
Following the example of counsel, I shall call this the Baird principle.
That slice of the vertical plane included, of course, the surface of the road over which the public had highway rights, the subsoil immediately beneath it, to a depth sufficient to provide for its support and drainage, and a modest slice of the airspace above it sufficient to enable the public to use and enjoy it, and the responsible authority to maintain and repair it, and to supervise its safe operation.
That lower slice was famously labelled the top two spits in Tithe Redemption Commission v Runcorn Urban District Council [1954] 1 Ch 383 at 407.
A spit is a spades depth.
Although colourful, that phrase says nothing about the necessary airspace above the surface.
Again following counsels example, I prefer the phrase zone of ordinary use.
It is common ground that the zone of ordinary use is a flexible concept, the application of which may lead to different depths of subsoil and heights of airspace being vested in a highway authority, both as between different highways and even, over time, as affects a particular highway, according to differences or changes in the nature and intensity of its public use.
A simple footpath or bridleway might only require shallow foundations, and airspace of up to about ten feet, to accommodate someone riding a horse.
By contrast a busy London street might require deep foundations to support intensive use, and airspace sufficient to accommodate double decker buses, and even the overhead electric power cables needed, in the past, by trolley buses and, now, by urban trams.
The Baird principle was developed so as to limit, in the vertical plane, the defeasible freehold interest automatically vested in the body responsible for the repair of a highway.
This was because, in a series of leading judgments, the court regarded this statutory vesting as a form of expropriation of private property rights without compensation, and was therefore concerned to limit its effect strictly to that which was necessary to achieve the Parliamentary objective, that is conferring upon highway authorities sufficient property to enable them to perform their statutory duties of the repair, maintenance and operation of highways.
Thus for example, in Coverdale v Charlton, Bramwell LJ said (at p 116) that it would be monstrous if the highway authority thereby acquired rights in valuable minerals below the surface.
In Rolls v Vestry of St George the Martyr, Southwark James LJ in a celebrated passage at p 796 said, of section 149 of the Public Health Act 1875: It seems to me very reasonable then to interpret this enactment in a way which gives everything that is wanted to be given to the public authority for the protection of the public rights without any unnecessary violation of the rights of the landowner.
In Tunbridge Wells Corpn v Baird Lord Halsbury LC said, after approving every word of what James LJ had said in the passage quoted above: That the street should be vested in them as well as under their control, may be, I suppose, explained by the idea that as James LJ points out, it was necessary to give, in a certain sense, a right of property in order to give efficient control over the street.
It was thought convenient, I presume, that there should be something more than a mere easement conferred upon the local authority, so that the complete vindication of the rights of the public should be preserved by the local authority; and, therefore, there was given to them an actual property in the street and in the materials thereof.
It is intelligible enough that Parliament should have vested the street qua street and, indeed, so much of the actual soil of the street as might be necessary for the purpose of preserving and maintaining and using it as a street.
At p 442 Lord Herschell said: My Lords, it seems to me that the vesting of the street vests in the urban authority such property and such property only as is necessary for the control, protection and maintenance of the street as a highway for public use.
The modern successor currently in force, to the 19th century legislation to which those authorities refer, is section 263 of the Highways Act 1980.
It provides, so far as is relevant, as follows: Vesting of highways maintainable at public expense. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, every highway maintainable at the public expense together with the materials and scrapings of it, vests in the authority who are for the time being the highway authority for the highway. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to a highway with respect to the vesting of which, on its becoming or ceasing to be a trunk road provision is made by section 265 below, It was, rightly, common ground between counsel that the Baird principle is firmly embedded in section 263.
Apart from the section numbers, this provision for automatic vesting was taken, word for word, from section 226 of the Highways Act 1959.
In its 1959 Report, the Committee of Consolidation on Highway Law, chaired by Lord Reading, which had been asked to consider the then draft bill, and whether amendments not of substantial importance to existing legislation should be made, clearly understood the rationale for the application of the Baird principle to what became section 226 (then clause 225), at para 135.
They said: The enactments reproduced in the clause have frequently been considered by the courts and it has been held that they vest in the highway authority the property in the surface of the highway and in so much of the actual soil below and the air above as may be reasonably required for its control, protection and maintenance as a highway.
Of rather more recent origin are those statutory antecedents to what is now section 265 of the Highways Act 1980, which make provision for the transfer of property and liabilities in connection with the designation of a highway as a trunk road, and the revocation of any such designation.
These provisions respond, not to the need to vest in a highway authority rights formerly enjoyed by private owners of the land, but rather to the need to transfer such rights (and liabilities) from one highway authority to another where the changed status of the highway causes a change in the identity of the public body responsible for its maintenance, repair and operation.
Prior to 1929 there was no specific statutory provision for this purpose.
In Finchley Electric Light Co Ltd v Finchley Urban District Council [1903] 1 Ch 437 the question was whether the defendant as local highway authority could restrain the running of a power cable by the plaintiff at a height of 34 feet above Regents Park Road in London.
The council had acquired property rights in relation to the road by automatic vesting under section 149 of the Public Health Act 1875 (a direct statutory predecessor of what is now section 263), the previous owners having been turnpike trustees, who had acquired it for the construction of a road.
The fact that the councils predecessors in title were turnpike trustees did not permit the Court of Appeal to do otherwise than apply the Baird principle to the automatic vesting achieved by section 149, even though the turnpike trustees had acquired their title by conveyance in unqualified terms, so as to have been the owners of the whole of the vertical plane above and below the location of the road.
Collins MR said: It seems to me that the standard which determines this question is, not how much the owner has to give, but how much the local authority under the Public Health Act have the right to take.
A hesitant start towards a more bespoke regime for transfers of property between successive highway authorities was made in section 29 of the Local Government Act 1929, in relation to main roads (renamed county roads) for which, thereafter, county councils rather than local councils were to be responsible.
Section 29 affords little assistance for present purposes because it appears to provide for the vesting only of the materials of the road and the drains belonging to it, leaving the vesting of property in the land itself (including the airspace above it) to the then provision for automatic vesting, in the Public Health Act 1875.
A more ambitious property transfer scheme was undertaken in relation to newly designated trunk roads by section 7 of the Trunk Roads Act 1936.
It provided as follows: Transfer of property and liabilities. (1) When a road becomes a trunk road, then, subject to the provisions of this section, of the property which immediately before the date on which the road became a trunk road was vested in the former highway authority for the purposes of their functions in relation to the road there shall, as from that date, be transferred to, and vest in, the Minister, by virtue of this section, the following property, that is to say: The road and any land (not being land vested in the former highway authority for the purpose of being used for the storage of materials required wholly or partly for the maintenance, repair or improvement of other roads or land acquired for the improvement or development of frontages or of land abutting on or adjacent to the road);
This was the provision in force in relation to trunk roads when the Reading Committee came to review the consolidating and amending Highways Bill in 1959.
Clause 229 of the Bill (which became, without amendment, section 228 of the 1959 Act) provided as follows: Transfer of property and liabilities on change of status of highway. (1) Where a highway becomes a trunk road, then, subject to the provisions of this section, there shall, as from the date on which the highway becomes a trunk road, be transferred to the Minister by virtue of this section (a) the highway, in so far as, immediately before said date, it was vested in the former highway authority, and (b) the property mentioned in the next following subsection, being property which, immediately before the said date, was vested (i) in the former highway authority for the purposes of their functions in relation to the highway, or in a council for the purposes of functions (ii) in relation to the highway under any enactment to which this section applies, and the highway and other property so transferred shall by virtue of this section vest in the Minister: (2) The property referred to in paragraph (b) of the foregoing subsection is (a) land, other than land vested in the former highway authority for (i) the purpose of being used for storage of materials required wholly or mainly for the maintenance or improvement of other highways, or (ii) acquired for improvement or development frontages to the highway, or of land adjoining or adjacent to the highway
It will be immediately apparent that there are significant linguistic similarities and differences between section 7 of the 1936 Act and section 228 of the 1959 Act.
What was previously called the road is now called the highway.
Whereas, in the 1936 Act, the transfer both of the road and other property (including land) was all regulated by the condition that it had been vested in the former highway authority for the purposes of their functions in relation to the highway that condition is, in the 1959 Act, applied in the same language to other property including land, but not in express terms to the highway.
Rather, the condition relating to the highway itself is that it is transferred in so far as, immediately before the said date, it was vested in the former highway authority.
There is also, in section 228(6), a provision for reverse transfer where a trunk road ceases to be a trunk road but it is not suggested that this significantly affects the present dispute.
Nothing in the Reading report (which includes a short commentary on what was then clause 227) suggests that the Committee thought that these changes to the language and layout of the provisions for transfer of property in relation to trunk roads effected any material change to the substance of those provisions.
The wording of section 228 of the 1959 Act was carried forward into what is now section 265 of the 1980 Act with very little alteration.
The phrase and the highway and other properties so transferred shall by virtue of this section vest in the Minister has been removed.
As already noted, article 2 of the Transfer Order takes as its model the provisions of section 265, again with no amendment which has any consequence in relation to the present dispute.
It was, more or less, common ground that since article 2 had been drafted on the basis of the model constituted by section 265, it was to that section that recourse had to be made to resolve the dispute as to the meaning of the article.
Analysis
The question for determination on this appeal, which is more focussed than the more widely drawn preliminary issues, is whether the provision in article 2(1)(a) for the transfer to TfL of the highway in relation to a GLA road, and the identical provision in section 265(1)(a) in relation to a trunk road, is governed by the Baird principle so as, in every case, to limit the property transferred within the vertical plane above and below the highway to the zone of ordinary use.
The appellant TfL claim that it is not so limited.
The respondent Councils say that it is.
This would be an arid academic question if the only way in which local authorities (including the respondent Councils) could ever acquire property rights in relation to highways was by automatic vesting under section 263 and its predecessors.
If that were so, the former highway authorities would only own the zone of ordinary use, and nothing in the airspace above it or the soil below it could ever be transferred, either under section 265(1)(a) or under article 2(1)(a).
But local highway authorities may also acquire, and the Councils certainly have acquired, property rights in relation to highways by other means.
They include compulsory purchase and acquisition by private treaty, which is completed in both cases by conveyance or transfer.
Furthermore, local authorities may come to have property rights in relation to highway land for purposes other than highways purposes, and may acquire such rights, again, by compulsory or voluntary purchase, by means of conveyance or transfer.
In the generality of such cases (save, that is, where there is a reservation of part of the vertical plane in the conveyance, or where the transferor does not own the whole of it) the local authority will acquire ownership of the whole of the vertical plane, not just the zone of ordinary use.
Local authorities may also come to have ownership rights in relation to highways by being or becoming adjoining owners: see below.
Furthermore, the ownership of airspace above, and subsoil below, the zone of ordinary use relating to a highway may, particularly in Central London, be of substantial commercial value.
Buildings are commonly constructed across a highway in the airspace above that part needed for its use as such.
The ground beneath highways is often intensively used for other purposes, such as underground railway stations, public lavatories and even, under the approach to Blackfriars bridge, a shooting gallery.
Similarly, ownership of the airspace and subsoil, even where not yet used for buildings or other structures, may have substantial development value.
These complexities are well illustrated in the admirable award of the arbitrator Mr John Male QC, and in the supporting materials.
There is nothing new about disputes concerning highway ownership arising from commercial motivation.
The question in the very earliest case, Coverdale v Charlton, was whether the highway authority had a sufficient proprietary right in the surface of the highway to let it for pasturage, sufficient to enable the plaintiff as lessee to bring proceedings for interference with it.
It was sufficient for the courts affirmative conclusion that the highway authority did own the surface of the highway, so that the vertical plane issue in the present case did not arise.
TfLs case, which was broadly accepted both by the arbitrator Mr John Male and, on the first appeal, by Mann J, may be summarised in this way.
The purpose of the Transfer Order, as part of a scheme under which TfL replaced the Councils as highway authority in relation to GLA roads was, at least in relation to property rights, to place TfL squarely in the shoes of those Councils.
Accordingly, whatever part of the vertical plane was owned by the Councils on the operative date, transferred under article 2(1)(a) to TfL.
From the generality of this conclusion the arbitrator made this exception.
Where particular layers or slices of subsoil and/or airspace (for example, certain structures) may have received or acquired a separate identity by the operative date, such that they could not properly be called parts of the highway, ownership in those slices would not pass to TfL.
This qualification is recorded in paragraph 265.2(1)(c) of his award.
On appeal, Mann J recorded a more significant concession made by Mr Morshead QC on behalf of TfL, namely that its claim related to land acquired for or appropriated to highway purposes: see para 56 of his judgment.
At common law (and subject to any statutory vesting) the owner of land adjoining a highway is taken to be the owner of the subsoil beneath it and the airspace above it ad medium filum ie as far as the centre line of the highway.
If the same person owns the adjoining land on both sides of the highway, then prima facie that person owns the whole of the vertical plane defined by the highway, outside the zone of ordinary use.
As the judge explained, the specific purpose of TfLs concession, quoted above, was to renounce any claim to a transfer of parts of the vertical plane above and below a GLA road where the Councils ownership of it derived from its status as the owner of adjoining land.
The Councils case, which was broadly accepted by the Court of Appeal, may be summarised as follows.
The purpose of the Transfer Order, like the purpose of all provisions for statutory vesting of property in highway authorities, was to vest in TfL only those ownership rights in the vertical plane of the highway which were necessary to enable it to perform its functions as highway authority.
Thus the Baird principle applied to article 2 just as much as it did to statutory vesting under section 263 and to transfer of property relating to trunk roads under section 265.
That was apparent from the fact that in all those instances, the drafter defined the property transferred as the highway, which had by the time of the Transfer Order come to have a clear and consistent meaning, limited to the zone of ordinary use.
Further, any more generous interpretation of article 2(1)(a) would expropriate from the Councils valuable property rights, particularly in Central London, without compensation to their ratepayers.
Accordingly, article 2(1)(a) transfers as the highway only the zone of ordinary use, leaving the Councils as continuing owners of anything else which they owned on the operative date within the vertical plane.
The question really boils down to this: does the Baird principle apply to article 2? In respectful disagreement with the Court of Appeal, I do not regard article 2 or, for that matter, section 265, as governed or constrained by the Baird principle.
My reasons follow.
In my judgment article 2(1)(a) transfers to TfL ownership of all that part of the vertical plane relating to a GLA road vested in the relevant council on the operative date, but only to the extent that ownership was then vested in the council in its capacity as former highway authority.
That is, in my view, the true meaning of the phrase the highway, in so far as it is vested in the former highway authority.
It follows that: i) rights held by the Councils in the vertical plane of a highway as adjoining owner, for purposes other than highway purposes, do not pass under article 2(1)(a).
This is because they are not held by the Council in its capacity as highway authority. ii) rights originally acquired for purposes other than highway purposes, or appropriated to those other purposes by the operative date, do not pass under article 2(1)(a).
This is so whether or not some non highway structure has by then been constructed.
If acquisition or appropriation for non highway purposes has occurred by the operative date, it matters not that the relevant purpose has yet to be fulfilled, so that the relevant part of the vertical plane remains undeveloped. iii) rights originally acquired for highway purposes in the vertical plane, for example by conveyance on compulsory acquisition for highway purposes, do pass under article 2(1)(a), even if they extend beyond the zone of ordinary use, provided that they have not, by the operative date, been appropriated to some non highway use outside the zone of ordinary use. iv) All these consequences, and in particular the first, flow from the true construction of article 2, rather than merely by way of TfLs concession as recorded by Mann J.
It may be that sub paragraph (ii) of the above summary differs a little from the reasoning of the arbitrator.
This is because, whereas he regarded a non highway structure actually built in the vertical plane (like an over flying building of underground public lavatory) as falling outside the definition of highway for all purposes, he did not (at least expressly) also regard the acquisition or appropriation of part of the vertical plane for non highway purposes as sufficient on its own to take that part, even if undeveloped, out of the property transferred under article 2(1)(a).
Meaning of highway
The Court of Appeal concluded that highway as used in article 2 and section 265 had a clear common law meaning, limited in the vertical plane to the zone of ordinary use.
I respectfully disagree.
The word highway is not a defined term, either in the 1980 Act, in the Transfer Order, or in the GLA Act.
There is a limited explanation, in section 328 of the 1980 Act that: In this Act, except where the context otherwise requires, highway means the whole or a part of a highway other than a ferry or waterway.
This is largely circular so far as concerns the core meaning of highway and, in any event, subject to context.
It does not follow that the interpreter is therefore required to find some uniform meaning of the word highway wherever it is used, either in the relevant legislation or, as the Court of Appeal thought, at common law.
There is in my view no single meaning of highway at common law.
The word is sometime used as a reference to its physical elements.
Sometimes it is used as a label for the incorporeal rights of the public in relation to the locus in quo.
Sometimes, as here, it is used as the label for a species of real property.
When used within a statutory formula, as here, the word necessarily takes its meaning from the context in which it is used.
In agreement with counsel and with the Court of Appeal, I do consider that the meaning of article 2 is to be found by an examination of the meaning of the almost identically worded section 265.
This is not merely because of the linguistic similarity between those two provisions, but because the whole of the structure for the transfer of property and liabilities in the Transfer Order is closely modelled on the pre existing structure of the provisions in section 265 relating to trunk roads.
It is tempting but, in my view, wrong to assume that, where sections 263 and 265 both refer to highway as a label for real property rights which are to be vested in a highway authority, the word highway must therefore have precisely the same meaning in both sections.
This is not merely because the word appears as part of two quite differently worded provisions.
Rather, it is because, although now lying almost side by side in a consolidating statute, the two sections have completely different ancestry, and serve two very different purposes.
As already noted, section 263 takes away from private ownership only those rights in the vertical plane of the highway which are necessary to enable the highway authority to perform its statutory functions of operation, maintenance and repair.
By contrast, section 265 merely transfers rights in the vertical plane already owned by one public authority to a successor public authority, so that the successor can stand in the shoes of its predecessor so far as ownership is concerned.
This is, in particular, apparent from the way in which the Bill which became the Trunk Roads Act 1936 was described to Parliament by the then Minister for Transport at its second reading.
Speaking of clause 7, he said: The basis for the transfer is, as laid down in clause 7, that the Minister should take over the road and all properties and liabilities attaching to it In the House of Lords the Earl of Erne, speaking for the Government,
described the objectives of the Bill as follows: The principle on which the Bill is based is to make a clean
transfer of responsibility
As already explained, section 7 of the Trunk Roads Act 1936 is the original progenitor of what is now section 265, having been significantly re worded in 1959 as section 228 of the Highways Act 1959, without any apparent intention thereby to effect any change of substance in its meaning.
There is no reason why the Baird principle should apply so as to restrict the nature or extent of property being transferred between two public highway authorities, one of which is stepping into the shoes of the other.
The only limitation which does need to be imposed is one which restricts the rights transferred to those enjoyed by the former highway authority in its capacity as such.
If the former authority enjoys rights in the vertical plane of the highway in some other capacity, such as adjoining owner, or for other public purposes, there is no sensible reason why those rights should be transferred to its successor as highway authority, merely because of the happenstance that they were vested in the former authority on the operative date.
Full effect to that qualification upon the extent of the rights transferred is given if the words in section 265(1)(a) in so far as, immediately before the operative date, it was vested in the former highway authority are taken as meaning vested in the former highway authority in its capacity as such.
When this way of interpreting section 265(1)(a), and the similarly worded article 2(1)(a), was suggested by the court to Mr Morshead for TfL, he acknowledged, upon reflection although not by way of concession, that this might well be correct.
By contrast, the respondent Councils case, that highway in section 265 and article 2 can never mean more than the zone of ordinary use, makes the words which immediately follow, quoted above, redundant.
A highway authority always has vested in it the zone of ordinary use, because of section 263, so the qualification beginning with the words in so far as then becomes meaningless.
Multi layering
Both the arbitrator and Mann J were powerfully affected by a perception of the unattractive consequences of the Councils construction, under what may be labelled as multi layering of the vertical plane.
Where a local highway authority had acquired land by compulsory purchase (or private treaty) for the purpose of building a road, and thereby had the whole of the vertical plane conveyed or transferred to it, the effect of the Councils construction of section 265 and article 2 would be, for the first time, to split that vertical plane between two successive highway authorities, one owning the top slice and the bottom slice, and the other owning the middle slice constituted by the zone of ordinary use.
As the arbitrator put it, at para 104: With all due respect to the Councils, I cannot see what rational purpose is served by there being two public bodies owning different layers of what was formerly owned by one single public body.
I agree.
The Court of Appeal acknowledged that this was a consequence of its interpretation but noted that multi layering of the vertical plane was already endemic within Central London, and that it was an insufficient factor to overcome what it regarded as the plain meaning of the word highway.
In my view, where the transposition of the settled meaning of a word from one section to another section of a complex consolidating statute produces an irrational result, that is a powerful reason for treating the word as having different meanings in those different contexts.
Furthermore, although article 2 only has effect in London, section 265 has effect in urban and rural areas alike.
It is of course true that some layering of the vertical plane is inevitable in relation to highways, both in rural and urban areas.
For example, it occurs whenever there is automatic vesting under section 263.
But in such a case the layering arises between a public authority on the one hand and private owners on the other, for reasons which are not irrational.
Equally, and particularly in the modern urban environment, there may be layering of the vertical plane between different public authorities, such as those responsible for highways, sewers and underground railways.
Again, this is for reasons which have a rational purpose.
By contrast, the irrationality identified by the arbitrator is that arising from two different highway authorities owning parts of the vertical plane in the same highway.
To that I would add that, on the Councils case, by virtue of the transfer of highway functions from one to the other, the former authority, which held rights in the vertical plane only as highway authority, continues to enjoy those rights while it has no further statutory responsibilities to discharge in its capacity as such.
It is difficult to identify any sensible purpose served by such an outcome.
I acknowledge also that my interpretation of article 2(1)(a), which limits the rights transferred to those transferred by the former highway authority in its capacity as such, will also lead to layering of the vertical plane in some cases where it did not previously exist.
This will occur, for example, where the former authority is an adjoining owner (with rights ad medium filum) or where the former authority has rights in part of the vertical plane for other statutory purposes, such as sewerage or the operation of underground railways.
But again, there is nothing irrational about layering of that kind.
Section 266A
The Court of Appeal was significantly influenced in its reasoning by a perception of the difficulties which might flow from TfLs interpretation of article 2, in conjunction with section 266A of the Highways Act 1980.
Mr Elvin QC for the respondent Councils pressed the same point upon us in his own excellent and succinct submissions.
Section 14B of the 1980 Act empowers the Mayor of London to direct that a highway or proposed highway shall become or cease to be a GLA road.
Section 266A provides for transfer of property and liabilities upon such an event.
It contains provisions which broadly reflect article 2(1)(b) and (3) of the Transfer Order, for the transfer of property including land, but contains no equivalent to article 2(1)(a) providing expressly for the transfer of the highway itself.
Mr Elvin submits that this must mean that in such a case, rights in the highway itself are transferred only under section 263, subject of course to the Baird principle.
Thus, if TfLs interpretation of article 2(1)(a) is correct, TfL would receive more of the vertical plane upon the original designation of a GLA road under the Designation Order than it would have to give back under section 266A if that designation was subsequently revoked under section 14B, an irrational outcome which cannot have been intended.
I agree that this would be a surprising and probably unintended outcome, but not that it is the consequence of the omission of an express reference to the highway in section 266A.
In my judgment, a preferable view may be that when a highway becomes or ceases to be a GLA road by virtue of an order made under section 14B, rights in the nature of real property in the vertical plane of the highway pass under section 266A(4)(a) as land.
It is preferable to Mr Elvins construction because a conclusion that rights in the highway itself only pass by virtue of section 263 would introduce the Baird principle into a context (transfer between successive public highway authorities) to which it has no sensible application.
I accept that this requires the word land to be given a different, larger, meaning in section 266A than it has in article 2, but this is simply because its narrower meaning in article 2 is necessitated by the separate express treatment of rights in the highway as real property; ie as land.
It is another example of identical words having different meanings as necessitated by their different contexts.
I need express no final view on the interpretation of section 266A because it is not directly in issue in this case.
Its later date means that it cannot be an aid to the interpretation of section 265, which was the model chosen for article 2, rather than the differently framed section 266A.
The Baylis case
Mr Elvin sought also to derive assistance from dicta of Mr Lewison QC (as he then was) in Secretary of State v Baylis (Gloucester) Ltd (2000) 80 P & CR 324, in a judgment with which the Court of Appeal agreed.
The issue in the Baylis case did relate to what had by the time of the trial become a trunk road, but it had nothing to do with the extent of rights in the vertical plane of a highway transferred between highway authorities under what is now section 265.
The dispute was about whether the strip of land in dispute, which adjoined the physical surface of the road, had ever been dedicated to the public as part of a highway, and that turned upon the true construction of a written agreement between the then owner and the county council.
The adjacent highway (for which the dedicated strip was to facilitate an improvement) had later been designated a trunk road, but that had no consequence for the determination of the dispute.
In an otherwise unimpeachable summary of the effect of land becoming part of a highway, Mr Lewison said: The effect of trunking a highway is that the highway vests in the Minister (now the Secretary of State).
The extent of such vesting is such part of the land as is necessary for the highway authority to perform its statutory functions.
It has been described as the top two spits.
It did not matter in that case whether the Secretary of State received the top two spits (or as I would prefer to call it the zone of ordinary use) or the whole of the vertical plane.
Furthermore the former highway authority had never obtained more than the zone of ordinary use, because its title depended upon automatic vesting under what is now section 263, following dedication.
I therefore respectfully disagree with that small (and obiter) part of Mr Lewisons succinct summary of the relevant highways law, for the detailed reasons which I have given.
Expropriation
A final reason why the Court of Appeal was persuaded that transfers under article 2 should be subject to the Baird principle of necessity was that, otherwise, the residents and ratepayers of the respondent Councils would be deprived, without compensation, of more property than was necessary to fulfil the purpose of constituting TfL as the relevant highway authority.
I have not been persuaded by this analogy.
In every case of a transfer between highway authorities, whether under section 265 or article 2, the former authority is being relieved of its responsibilities for operation, maintenance and repair of the relevant highway, and all associated liabilities (subject to certain exceptions).
The transfer of property held by the former highway authority in its capacity as such is simply the quid pro quo for that relief from responsibility.
The ratepayers get the full financial benefit of that relief from responsibility.
There may be cases where the value of the transferred ownership of the vertical plane exceeds the financial burden of the responsibilities, eg where the vertical plane outside the zone of ordinary use has development value.
That may be part of the reason for this long and costly litigation.
But usually it will have no such excess value.
The meaning of article 2 and section 265 cannot vary as between one highway and another by reference to such infinitely variable economic comparisons.
Burden of Proof
While acknowledging that article 2(1)(a) of the Transfer Order might best be interpreted as subject to the limitation that rights in the highway should have been vested in the former highway authority in its capacity as such, Mr Morshead for TfL submitted that there should, nonetheless, be a strong presumption that all rights in the vertical plane as were in fact vested in the former highway authority on the operative date were vested in it in that capacity.
It would be, he said, for the former authority (here the respondent Councils) to prove otherwise, the burden being firmly upon them.
I can see no good reason why any such presumption or burden of proof should be identified as flowing from the true interpretation of article 2.
The papers lodged with the court on this appeal demonstrate that the resolution of these vertical plane issues in the context of highways in Central London, where they cannot be agreed, is an intensely fact sensitive and complex task.
As already explained, the Councils will have acquired rights in the vertical plane in a variety of different ways, and it will be necessary to analyse both the extent of the rights acquired, and the capacity in which the Council acquired those rights.
Sometimes the GLA road has a non GLA highway running over or under it.
There are frequently buildings and other structures encroaching upon the vertical plane of the highway, outside the zone of ordinary use.
The arbitrator should not be saddled with a presumption as to the outcome of that difficult factual analysis, one way or the other.
The Lateral Plane
It was mentioned by counsel, and in the statement of agreed facts and issues, that the resolution of the dispute in this appeal would also have consequences in the lateral plane, rather than only the vertical plane, of land defined by a highway.
That may be so, but all the argument before this court has been directed to the vertical plane.
Nothing in this judgment should be taken as implying any view about lateral plane issues, which were not explored.
Conclusion
For the above reasons, I consider that this appeal should be allowed.
The interpretation which I conceive to be correct differs in some small respects from that adopted by the arbitrator and indeed by Mann J, in dismissing the first appeal.
Furthermore the questions as originally framed in the preliminary issues determined by the arbitrator have since narrowed.
It will therefore be necessary to receive submissions about the precise form of order which this court should now make in relation to the preliminary issues which are the subject of this appeal.
","This appeal concerns the effect of the GLA Roads and Side Roads (Transfer of Property etc) Order 2000 (SI 2000/1552) (the Transfer Order) and the GLA Roads Designation Order 2000 (SI 2000/1117) (the Designation Order).
By combined operation of those Orders, responsibility for Greater London Authority (GLA) roads was transferred from individual London borough councils, including the Respondents (the Councils) as local highway authorities, to the Appellant (TfL).
The provision at the heart of this appeal is article 2(1)(a) of the Transfer Order, which provides for the transfer of the highway, in so far as it is vested in the former highway authority.
TfL and the Councils convened a statutory arbitration before Mr John Males QC.
The purpose was to determine exactly what specified property and liabilities transferred to TfL in relation to each highway.
The dispute between the parties is whether the automatic transfer of the highway under article 2(1)(a) of the Transfer Order carried with it: (i) only the zone of ordinary use (i.e. the road surface and the airspace and subsoil necessary for the operation, maintenance and repair of the road) or (ii) the entire vertical plane (i.e. all the airspace above and the subsoil below the surface of the road), to the extent that the relevant council already owned it prior to the transfer date.
In the arbitration and at each stage on appeal, the Councils argued the transfer was limited to the former, while TfL argued for the latter, wider approach.
The arbitrator broadly agreed with TfLs case.
The caveat was that particular layers or slices of subsoil and/or airspace that had acquired a separate identity by the transfer date could not be treated as parts of the highway and so did not pass to TfL.
On appeal to the High Court, Mr Justice Mann agreed with the arbitrator, recording a concession by counsel for TfL that its claim related to land acquired for or appropriated to highway purposes.
However, on further appeal, the Court of Appeal adopted a narrower position.
It considered that the word highway in article 2(1)(a) of the Transfer Order must have been intended to carry the same meaning as it had at common law, and in relation to section 263 of the Highways Act 1980 (the 1980 Act).
Thus, the Court of Appeal held that only the zone of ordinary use had transferred to TfL.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal.
Lord Briggs gives the sole judgment of the Court.
The word highway has no single meaning in the law [6].
The default land law position, that the conveyance of freehold land automatically involves the transfer of the entire vertical plane, was not
followed in successive statutory provisions dealing with automatic vesting of highway interests formerly in private ownership, as seen in the decision in Tunbridge Wells Corpn v Baird [1896] AC 434 (HL) (the Baird principle) [7 8].
The Baird principle provides that such a transfer was limited to the road surface, the subsoil immediately beneath it and airspace sufficient to enable use and enjoyment by the public and maintenance by the highway authority [9].
The limits set by the Baird principle reflected concerns about expropriation of private property without compensation resulting from statutory vesting [11].
It was, rightly, common ground that the Baird principle applies to section 263 of the 1980 Act, replicating section 226 of the Highways Act 1959 (the 1959 Act) [12].
However, section 265 of the 1980 Act and its predecessors make provision for the transfer of property and liabilities, as between successive highway authorities, of highways designated as trunk roads [13].
The first major property transfer scheme was undertaken in relation to newly designated trunk roads by section 7 of the Trunk Roads Act 1936 (the 1936 Act) [15].
Despite differences in language, the substance of section 228 of the 1956 Act and section 265 of the 1980 are materially the same as section 7 of the 1936 Act [16 19].
The extent of transfer of highway rights is complicated by the fact that local highway authorities often acquire property rights in relation to highways by means other than automatic vesting under section 263, such as compulsory purchase and acquisition by private treaty and, at times, for non highway purposes [21].
Ownership of airspace above and subsoil below the zone of ordinary use may also be of substantial commercial or development value, particularly in urban areas like Central London [22].
Disagreeing with the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court decides that the Baird principle does not apply to article 2 of the Transfer Order or to section 265 of the 1980 Act, upon which article 2 was modelled [28].
The words [t]he highway, in so far as it is vested in the former highway authority in article 2, properly construed, mean only that part of the vertical plane relating to a GLA road which was vested in the relevant council on the operative date, in its capacity as former highway authority, is transferred [29].
The Supreme Court disagrees with the Court of Appeals reasoning that the word highway, used in article 2 and section 265, has a clear common law meaning it is not a defined term and its meaning in this context is to be found through the almost identical wording of section 265 on trunk roads [31 33].
Given the different ancestry of, and purposes served by, section 263 and section 265 of the 1980 Act, the word highway used in both provisions cannot be given the same meaning [34 36].
The phrase beginning with in so far as in section 265(1)(a) of the 1980 Act, and in article 2, imports the ownership capacity limitation [37 39].
The Courts approach, like that of the arbitrator, largely avoids irrational types of multi layering on the vertical plane in the sense of different highway authorities owning parts of the vertical plane in the same highway [40 43].
Further, expropriation concerns are not well founded because, generally, the transfer of property from one highway authority to another is simply the quid pro quo for relief from responsibility for operation and maintenance [48].
Lastly, there is no presumption or burden of proof as to the extent of highway rights transferred [49 50].
This decision does not resolve any issues as to the ownership of the lateral plane of a highway [51].
"
uksc-2012-0109,"This appeal arises from a sorry case of a serious failure by an air tour operator to see that proper provision was made for the needs of a disabled passenger, contrary to the requirements of the Civil Aviation (Access to Air Travel for Disabled Persons and Persons with Reduced Mobility) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/1895) (the UK Disability Regulations).
The UK Disability Regulations implement Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air (the EC Disability Regulation).
The issue is whether a court may award damages for a claimants discomfort and injury to feelings caused by a breach of the UK Disability Regulations.
The conclusion of the courts below was that any such award is precluded by the Montreal Convention, as adopted in the EU by the Montreal Regulation (or, to use its full title, Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 on air carrier liability in the event of accidents, as amended by Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 889/2002).
The appeal has been brought with the backing of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and it has the additional support of the Secretary of State for Transport as an intervener.
The parties
Mr Christopher Stott is paralysed from the shoulders down and is a permanent wheel chair user.
He has double incontinence and uses a catheter.
When travelling by air, he depends on his wife to manage his incontinence since he cannot move round the aircraft.
He also relies on her to help him to eat and to change his sitting position.
Thomas Cook Tour Operators Ltd is a well known tour operator which provides overseas package holidays and flights to many destinations.
It is an air carrier with an operating licence granted by a Member State of the EU and therefore subject to the obligations imposed on Community air carriers by the EC Disability Regulation.
The facts
I take the following summary of the facts from the judgment of the trial judge, Recorder Atherton, delivered on 19 January 2011 in the Manchester County Court: 4.
On 12 September 2008 Mr Stott booked with the defendant to fly from East Midlands Airport to Zante, departing 22 September and returning 29 September 2008.
Soon after making the booking on the internet he telephoned the defendant's helpline to advise that he had booked and paid to be seated next to his wife on both flights.
He called the helpline again on 19 September and was assured that he and his wife would be seated together. 5.
The outward flight went reasonably according to plan but sadly the return journey did not.
Mr and Mrs Stott encountered many difficulties at the airport in Zante.
At check in they were told they would not be seated together.
In response to their protestations the supervisor eventually told them that their problem would be sorted out at the departure gate.
When they arrived at the departure gate their expectations were unfulfilled.
They were told that other passengers had already boarded and the seat allocations could not be changed. 6.
When boarding the aircraft from an ambulift, matters got much worse.
As he entered the aircraft, Mr Stott's wheelchair overturned and he fell to the cabin floor.
Those present appeared not to know how to deal with the situation.
Mr Stott felt extremely embarrassed, humiliated and angry and his wife, who had recently suffered serious ill health herself, was also very distressed at the chaotic scenes. 7.
Eventually Mr Stott was assisted into his aisle seat in the front row and his wife was seated behind him.
This arrangement caused them considerable difficulties in that it was difficult for Mrs Stott to assist her husband with his catheterisation, catheter bags, food and movement during the three hour twenty minute flight.
The defendant's cabin crew apparently made no attempt to ease their difficulties.
They made no requests of other passengers to enable Mr and Mrs Stott to sit together.
From time to time during the flight she had to kneel or crouch in the aisle to attend to her husband's personal needs and inevitably she obstructed the cabin crew and other passengers as they made their way up and down the aisle.
It was, therefore, a very unhappy experience for them.
The claim 8.
Mr Stott brought a claim under the UK Disability Regulations for a declaration that the respondents treatment of him was in breach of its duty under the EC Disability Regulation, in that it had failed to make all reasonable efforts to give his wife a seat next to him, together with damages including aggravated damages.
The recorder made such a declaration, and there has been no appeal against it.
He found that Mr Stott had suffered injury to his feelings, for which he said that he would have awarded 2,500 as compensation (taking into account the duration of the flight), if it had been open to him to do so.
However, he concluded that he had no power to make such an award, by reason of the Montreal Convention.
The Court of Appeal upheld the recorders decision in a judgment delivered by Maurice Kay LJ, with which Sullivan LJ and Dame Janet Smith agreed ([2012] EWCA Civ 66).
Both courts expressed their sympathy for Mr Stott but they considered that the law was clear.
UK Disability Regulations
The UK Disability Regulations were made by the Secretary of State for Transport under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.
As the explanatory note states, they provide for the enforcement of the rights set out in the EC Disability Regulation.
The UK Disability Regulations are short.
Regulation 3 makes it an offence for an air carrier, an agent of an air carrier or a tour operator to contravene an obligation imposed by any of a number of articles of the EC Disability Regulation, and regulation 4 provides penalties for such offences.
In the present case the respondent has not been prosecuted, but on the recorders finding it was guilty of an offence carrying a potential fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.
The maximum level 5 fine on summary conviction is currently 5,000: Criminal Justice Act 1982, as amended, section 37.
There will be no maximum limit when the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, section 85, comes into effect.
Regulation 9 is headed Compensation claims by disabled persons etc.
It provides: (1) A claim by a disabled person or a person with reduced mobility for an infringement of any of his rights under the EC Regulation may be made the subject of civil proceedings in the same way as any other claim in tort or (in Scotland) in reparation for breach of statutory duty. (2) For the avoidance of doubt, any damages awarded in respect of any infringement of the EC Regulation may include compensation for injury to feelings whether or not they include compensation under any other head. (3) Proceedings in England, Wales or Northern Ireland may be brought only in a county court. (4) Proceedings in Scotland may be brought only in a sheriff court. (5) The remedies available in such proceedings are those which are available in the High Court or (as the case may be) the Court of Session.
EC Disability Regulation
The general purpose of the EC Disability Regulation is apparent from the following paragraphs of the preamble: (1) The single market for air services should benefit citizens in general.
Consequently, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, whether caused by disability, age or any other factor, should have opportunities for air travel comparable to those of other citizens.
Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility have the same right as all other citizens to free movement, freedom of choice and non discrimination.
This applies to air travel as to other areas of life. (4) In order to give disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility opportunities for air travel comparable to those of other citizens, assistance to meet their particular needs should be provided at the airport as well as on board aircraft, by employing the necessary staff and equipment.
In the interests of social inclusion, the persons concerned should receive this assistance without additional charge. (15) Member States should supervise and ensure compliance with this Regulation and designate an appropriate body to carry out enforcement tasks.
This supervision does not affect the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility to seek legal redress from courts under national law. (18) Member States should lay down penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those penalties are applied.
The penalties, which could include ordering the payment of compensation to the person concerned, should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
Article 1 provides: 1.
This Regulation establishes rules for the protection of and provision of assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility travelling by air, both to protect them against discrimination and to ensure that they receive assistance. 2.
The provisions of this Regulation shall apply to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, using or intending to use commercial passenger air services on departure from, on transit through, or on arrival at an airport, when the airport is situated in the territory of a Member State to which the Treaty applies.
Article 7 provides: 1.
When a disabled person or person with reduced mobility arrives at an airport for travel by air, the managing body of the airport shall be responsible for ensuring the provision of the assistance specified in Annex I in such a way that the person is able to take the flight for which he or she holds a reservation, provided that the notification of the person's particular needs for such assistance has been made to the air carrier or its agent or the tour operator concerned at least 48 hours before the published time of departure of the flight.
This notification shall also cover a return flight, if the outward flight and the return flight have been contracted with the same air carrier. 2.
Where use of a recognised assistance dog is required, this shall be accommodated provided that notification of the same is made to the air carrier or its agent or the tour operator in accordance with applicable national rules covering the carriage of assistance dogs on board aircraft, where such rules exist. 3.
If no notification is made in accordance with paragraph 1, the managing body shall make all reasonable efforts to provide the assistance specified in Annex I in such a way that the person concerned is able to take the flight for which he or she holds a reservation. 4.
The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply on condition that: (a) the person presents himself or herself for check in: (i) at the time stipulated in advance and in writing (including by electronic means) by the air carrier or its agent or the tour operator, or (ii) if no time is stipulated, not later than one hour before the published departure time, or (b) the person arrives at a point within the airport boundary designated in accordance with article 5: (i) at the time stipulated in advance and in writing (including by electronic means) by the air carrier or its agent or the tour operator, or (ii) if no time is stipulated, not later than two hours before the published departure time.
Article 10 provides: An air carrier shall provide the assistance specified in Annex II without additional charge to a disabled person or person with reduced mobility departing from, arriving at or transiting through an airport to which this Regulation applies provided that the person in question fulfils the conditions set out in article 7(1), (2) and (4).
The assistance specified in Annex II includes: Where a disabled person or person with reduced mobility is assisted by an accompanying person, the air carrier will make all reasonable efforts to give such person a seat next to the disabled person or person with reduced mobility.
This was the obligation which the respondent breached.
Article 12 provides: Where wheelchairs or other mobility equipment or assistive devices are lost or damaged whilst being handled at the airport or transported on board aircraft, the passenger to whom the equipment belongs shall be compensated, in accordance with rules of international, Community and national law.
Although article 12 is not applicable in the present case, since Mr Stotts wheelchair was not damaged, it has a broader relevance inasmuch as the reference to compensation in accordance with rules of international law clearly embraces the Montreal Convention.
Articles 14 to 16 provide for three methods of enforcement.
Article 14 provides for each Member State to designate an enforcement body or bodies.
In the UK the designated body is the Civil Aviation Authority.
Article 15 provides for the establishment of complaints procedures.
Article 16 provides: The Member States shall lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that those rules are implemented.
The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
The Member States shall notify those provisions to the Commission and shall notify it without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting them.
Montreal Convention
The full title of the Montreal Convention is the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air.
It was agreed at Montreal on 28 May 1999.
The EU is a signatory.
The predecessor of the Montreal Convention was signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929 (the Warsaw Convention).
It was amended in 1955 at the Hague, but the amended Convention continued to be known by its original name.
The Montreal Convention replaced the Warsaw Convention but followed its general structure.
Its purpose according to the preamble was to modernize and consolidate the Warsaw Convention and related instruments.
There is no material difference in their scope of application, as defined in each case in article 1.
Each begins by stating that the Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward.
Chapter III of the Warsaw Convention was headed Liability of the carrier.
The heading of the same chapter in the Montreal Convention has the additional words and extent of compensation for damage.
In chapter III of the Warsaw Convention, article 17 dealt with liability for death or injury to passengers as a result of an accident sustained on board the aircraft or in the course of embarkation or disembarkation, and article 18 dealt with liability for damage to or loss of any registered luggage or goods.
In chapter III of the Montreal Convention liability for death or bodily injury is dealt with in article 17.1 in materially identical terms to article 17 of the Warsaw Convention.
Loss of or damage to a passengers baggage is dealt with in article 17.2 to 17.4, and loss of or damage to cargo are dealt with in article 18, but the differences are matters of detail.
There are also broadly parallel provisions for liability for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage of passengers, baggage or cargo.
Two features of the Conventions are of critical relevance.
First, there are limits to the type of injury or damage which is compensable and the amount of compensation recoverable.
Bodily injury (or lsion corporelle) has been held not to include mental injury, such as post traumatic stress disorder or depression (Morris v KLM Royal Dutch Airlines [2002] UKHL 7; [2002] 2 AC 628).
The same would apply to injury to feelings.
Secondly, there is an exclusivity provision.
The exclusivity provision in the Warsaw Convention was contained in article 24: 1.
In the cases covered by articles 18 and 19 any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention. 2.
In the cases covered by article 17 the provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply, without prejudice to the questions as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.
The effect of this provision was considered by the House of Lords in Sidhu v British Airways plc [1997] AC 430, to which I will refer in more detail.
29: In the Montreal Convention the exclusivity provision is contained in article In the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.
In any such action, punitive, exemplary or any other non compensatory damages shall not be recoverable.
The effect is the same as that of article 24 of the Warsaw Convention, except for the addition of the sentence specifically excluding punitive, exemplary or other non compensatory damages.
Article 29 is the rock on which Mr Stotts claim for damages foundered.
Montreal Regulation
The Montreal Convention has effect in the UK by different routes depending on whether the carrier is a Community air carrier.
Generally the Montreal Convention has force in the UK by virtue of section 1 of the Carriage by Air Act 1961 as amended, but not in relation to Community air carriers to the extent that the Montreal Regulation has force in the UK: section 1(2) of the 1961 Act.
The Montreal Regulation has direct effect in the UK by virtue of section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972.
The Montreal Regulation followed the conclusion of the Montreal Convention.
Its purpose, as stated in an explanatory memorandum issued by the Commission, was to ensure full alignment between the Montreal Convention and community law.
To that end, article 3.1 states: The liability of a Community air carrier in respect of passengers and their baggage shall be governed by all provisions of the Montreal Convention relevant to such liability.
The Montreal Convention therefore has effect in the UK in relation to Community air carriers through that article.
The exclusivity principle
In Sidhu the House of Lords considered the question whether a passenger who sustained damage in the course of international carriage by air due to the fault of the carrier, but had no claim against the carrier under article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, was left without a remedy.
It concluded that this was so.
Lord Hope gave the only speech.
He analysed the history, structure and text of the Convention, and he reviewed the domestic and international case law.
He explained that the Convention was a package.
It gave to passengers significant rights, easily enforceable, but it imposed limitations.
He held that the whole purpose of article 17, read in its context, was to prescribe the circumstances that is to say, the only circumstances in which a carrier would be liable to the passenger for claims arising out of his international carriage by air.
To permit exceptions, whereby the passenger could sue outside the Convention for losses sustained in the course of international carriage by air, would distort the whole system, even in cases for which the Convention did not create any liability on the part of the carrier.
This interpretation has been accepted and applied in many other jurisdictions.
In the USA the leading authority is the decision of the Supreme Court in El Al Israel Airlines Ltd v Tseng 525 US 155 (1999).
The plaintiff was subjected to an intrusive security search at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York before she boarded a flight to Tel Aviv.
She sued the airline under New York tort law for damages for psychosomatic injury.
The Supreme Court had previously held in Eastern Airlines Inc v Floyd 499 US 530 (1991) that mental or psychic injuries unaccompanied by physical injuries were not compensable under article 17, but the plaintiff argued that her claim in respect of the treatment which she suffered before embarkation was not within the reach of the preemptive effect of the Convention.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted that argument.
In its judgment it expressed the fear that if the Convention had the preclusive effect for which the airline contended, it would follow, for example, that a passenger injured by a malfunctioning escalator in the airlines terminal would have no remedy against the airline even if it had recklessly disregarded its duty to maintain the escalator in proper repair.
The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals in an opinion delivered by Justice Ginsburg (Justice Stevens dissenting).
Applying the principle that an international treaty must be interpreted not as if it were a domestic instrument, but so as to accord with the courts understanding of the shared expectations of the contracting parties, Justice Ginsburg referred to the French text of article 24 of the Warsaw Convention (the earlier equivalent of article 29 of the Montreal Convention): (1) Dans les cas prevus aux articles 18 et 19 toute action en responsabilite, a quelque titre que ce soit, ne peut etre exercee que dans les conditions et limites prevues par la presente Convention. (2) Dans les cas prevus a l'article 17, s'appliquent egalement les dispositions de l'alinea precedent, sans prejudice de la determination des personnes qui ont le droit d'agir et de leurs droits respectifs.
Tseng argued that les cas prevus a larticle 17 meant those cases in which a passenger could actually maintain a case for relief under article 17.
El Al argued, with the support of the US government as amicus curiae, that the expression referred generically to all personal injury cases stemming from occurrences on board an aircraft or in embarking or disembarking.
So read, article 24 would preclude a passenger from asserting any air transit personal injury claims under local law, including claims that failed to satisfy article 17s liability conditions (perhaps because the injury did not result from an accident or because the accident did not result in physical injury or manifestation of injury).
The court judged that the governments interpretation of article 24 was more faithful to the Conventions text, purpose and overall structure.
Its reasoning process accorded with that of the House of Lords in Sidhu, to which Justice Ginsburg referred, at pp 175 176: Decisions of the courts of other Convention signatories corroborate our understanding of the Convention's preemptive effect.
In Sidhu, the British House of Lords considered and decided the very question we now face concerning the Convention's exclusivity when a passenger alleges psychological damages, but no physical injury, resulting from an occurrence that is not an accident under Article 17.
See [[1997] AC 430, 441, 447].
Reviewing the text, structure, and drafting history of the Convention, the Lords concluded that the Convention was designed to ensure that, in all questions relating to the carrier's liability, it is the provisions of the Convention which apply and that the passenger does not have access to any other remedies, whether under the common law or otherwise, which may be available within the particular country where he chooses to raise his action. Ibid.
Courts of other nations bound by the Convention have also recognized the treaty's encompassing preemptive effect.
The opinions of our sister signatories, we have observed, are entitled to considerable weight. [Air France v] Saks, 470 US at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The text, drafting history, and underlying purpose of the Convention, in sum, counsel us to adhere to a view of the treaty's exclusivity shared by our treaty partners.
The court put to rest the Court of Appeals fear that such a conclusion would mean that a passenger who had an accident in the terminal building through the negligence of the person responsible for its maintenance might be left without a remedy.
Justice Ginsburg observed that the Conventions preemptive effect on local law extended no further than the Conventions own substantive scope, and that a carrier would be indisputably subject to liability under local law for injuries arising outside that scope, for example, for passenger injuries occurring before the operation of embarking.
In King v American Airlines Inc 284 F 3d 352 (2002) the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit considered the question whether discrimination claims could properly be regarded as generically outside the Conventions substantive scope, so that a claim for compensation under local law would not be affected by the Convention.
The assumed facts were that the plaintiffs were bumped from an overbooked flight because of their race.
Upholding an order for the dismissal of the claim, the court held that discrimination claims under local law which arose in the course of embarking on an aircraft were preempted by the Convention.
The argument advanced unsuccessfully by the plaintiffs was that discrimination claims fell outside the scope of the Convention because of their qualitative nature.
Sotomayor CJ (now Justice Sotomayor of the US Supreme Court), delivering the opinion of the court, emphasised that the preemptive scope of the Convention depends not on the qualitative nature of the act or omission giving rise to the claim but on when and where the salient event took place: Article 17 directs us to consider when and where an event takes place in evaluating whether a claim for an injury to a passenger is preempted.
Expanding upon the hypothetical posed by the Tseng Court, a passenger injured on an escalator at the entrance to the airport terminal would fall outside the scope of the Convention, while a passenger who suffers identical injuries on an escalator while embarking or disembarking a plane would be subject to the Convention's limitations.
Tseng, 525 US at 171.
It is evident that these injuries are not qualitatively different simply because they have been suffered while embarking an aircraft, and yet article 17 plainly distinguishes between these two situations.' [Original emphasis] The aim of the Warsaw Convention is to provide a single rule of carrier liability for all injuries suffered in the course of the international carriage of passengers and baggage.
As Tseng makes clear, the scope of the Convention is not dependent on the legal theory pled nor on the nature of the harm suffered.
See Tseng, 525 US at 171 (rejecting a construction of the Convention that would look to the type of harm suffered, because it would encourage artful pleading by plaintiffs seeking to opt out of the Convention's liability scheme when local law promised recovery in excess of that prescribed by the treaty); Cruz v Am Airlines, 338 US App DC 246, 193 F3d 526, 531 (DC Cir 1999) (determining that fraud claim was preempted by Article 18, because the events that gave rise to the action were so closely related to the loss of [plaintiffs'] luggage . as to be, in a sense, indistinguishable from it).
The judge noted that in a number of cases US District Courts had addressed the issue whether discrimination claims were preempted by the Convention and had all reached a similar view.
She concluded her judgment with some broader observations which have a resonance in the present case: Plaintiffs raise the specter that our decision will open the doors to blatant discrimination aboard international flights, invoking images of airline passengers segregated according to race and without legal recourse.
They suggest that, despite Article 24's plain mandate that the Warsaw Convention preempts any cause of action, however founded, we should nonetheless carve out an exception for civil rights actions as a matter of policy.
This we decline to do.
It is our responsibility to give the specific words of the treaty a meaning consistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties.
Saks, 470 US at 399.
It is not for the courts to rewrite the terms of a treaty between sovereign nations.
Cf Turturro, 128 F Supp 2d at 181 (The Convention massively curtails damage awards for victims of horrible acts [of] terrorism; the fact that the Convention also abridges recovery for . discrimination should not surprise anyone.).
Moreover, while private suits are an important vehicle for enforcing the anti discrimination laws, they are hardly the only means of preventing discrimination on board aircraft.
Federal law provides other remedies.
Responsibility for oversight of the airline industry has been entrusted to the Secretary of Transportation.
The Kings could, therefore, have filed a complaint with the Secretary. 49 USC 46101.
The FAA prohibits air carriers, including foreign air carriers, from subjecting a person to unreasonable discrimination.
Id 41310(a).
The Secretary has the authority to address violations of FAA provisions, including the power to file civil actions to enforce federal law.
Id 46106.
It does not follow from the preemption of the Kings' private cause of action that air carriers will have free rein to discriminate against passengers during the course of an international flight.
Sidhu and Tseng have been followed by the Federal Court of Australia in South Pacific Air Motive Pty Ltd v Magnus 157 ALR 443 (1998), the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong in Ong v Malaysian Airline System Berhad [2008] HKCA 88, the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada in Air Canada v Thibodeau [2012] FCA 246 and the High Court of Ireland in Hennessey v Aer Lingus Ltd [2012] IEHC 124.
Sidhu was similarly followed by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in Emery Air Freight Corpn v Nerine Nurseries Ltd [1997] 3 NZLR 723.
The same principle has been recognised by the Supreme Court of Germany (Bundesgerichtshof), 15 March 2011, Urteil Az X ZR 99/10.
The arguments
Mr Robin Allen QC submitted that since the Montreal Convention has effect within the EU via the Montreal Regulation, it is a question of European law whether the courts below were right to hold that Mr Stotts claim for damages for breach of the UK Disability Regulations was incompatible with the Convention.
He submitted that Mr Stotts claim is unaffected by the Montreal Regulation because its subject matter was outside both the substantive scope and the temporal scope of the Regulation.
The argument on the first point was summarised succinctly in the appellants written case as follows: Applying the Vienna Convention, the [Montreal Convention] is not in any sense concerned with giving access to air travel to disabled persons.
Rights conferred in order to ensure equal access to air travel for disabled people (and remedies granted for breach of those rights) are simply not to use Lord Hopes language in Sidhu areas with which [the Convention] deals.
For this reason, it is submitted that it would be a mistake to use the MC to limit the rights and obligations that Union legislation imposes in relation to such access.
The argument on the second point was based on the recorders finding that the airlines failure to make all reasonable efforts to seat Mr Stott next to his wife began prior to embarkation.
In support of his argument Mr Allen relied on a number of European authorities.
He accepted that none of them was conclusive in relation to the present case, but he submitted that the court ought to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU): (a) Whether the right to compensation for breach of duties to take reasonable steps to assist disabled persons in the context of air travel (which the Union legislator specifically contemplated in the EC Disability Regulation), like the rights to compensation conferred by Regulation 261/2004, should be regarded as falling within a different regulatory framework from, or as complementary to, the MC (rather than in conflict with it); (b) Whether compensation awarded in respect of breaches of the duties imposed by the EC Disability Regulation both on board the aircraft and earlier, like compensation for delay awarded under Regulation 261/2004, simply operates at an earlier stage than the system which results from the Montreal Convention; (c) Whether a member state which confers a right to compensation under its domestic law for failures by the providers of goods and services to take reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of disabled persons is obliged by the principles of equivalence and/or effectiveness, when implementing the EC Disability Regulation, to provide a similarly favourable remedy for similar failures in the context of air travel amounting to breaches of that Regulation; (d) How that obligation to provide an effective remedy for breaches of the EC Disability Regulation is to be reconciled with the exclusivity principle contained in the MC in circumstances where:(a) the remedy is provided to give effect to the right to equal access to air travel, which is itself derived from the fundamental anti discrimination rights conferred by the Charter and (b) the MC was never intended to, and does not, deal with the question of access to air travel.
Mr Allen submitted that these questions are important and unresolved.
The answers to them are not so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt.
Article 267 therefore requires a reference from this court, as the UKs final court of appeal, to the CJEU.
Mr Daniel Beard QC, on behalf of the Secretary of State, concentrated on the temporal argument.
He submitted that on the recorders findings of fact, liability for breach of the UK Disability Regulations arose prior to embarkation, and therefore it was plain that Mr Stotts claim was not preempted by the Montreal Convention.
In his submission, there was no need for a reference to the CJEU and the appeal should be allowed.
Mr John Kimbell, on behalf of the respondent, pointed out that the particulars of injury to feelings pleaded in Mr Stotts particulars of claim related to his treatment during the process of embarkation and during the flight, which made him feel humiliated and for which he claimed damages.
It was for such injury to his feelings, occasioned during the embarkation and flight, that the recorder assessed the appropriate monetary compensation, subject to the question whether it was permissible.
Mr Kimbell submitted that this was the gravamen of the claim, and that it fell within the temporal scope of the Montreal Convention.
The claim for damages for such injury to feelings under the UK Disability Regulations was therefore preempted by article 29 of the Montreal Convention, as that article (or rather its predecessor) had been interpreted in Sidhu.
He observed that the court was not being asked to reconsider the correctness of the decision in Sidhu, which has moreover received uniform international support.
He submitted that the legal basis of Mr Stotts claim for damages under domestic law was irrelevant (as properly recognised, for example, in King v American Airlines).
All that mattered was that it was a claim for damages referable to the treatment of Mr Stott in the course of his international carriage by air.
Accordingly, he submitted that on the established authorities the decision of the Court of Appeal upholding the recorder was plainly right, and there was no cause for a reference to the CJEU.
European case law
Mr Allen relied on a line of cases in which the CJEU has considered the compatibility of the Montreal Regulation with the provisions of another EU Regulation, No 261/2004, requiring compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denial of boarding, cancellation or long delays of flights.
Article 5 concerns cancellation.
Article 6 concerns delay.
Each requires the passengers to be offered various forms of assistance, such as hotel accommodation where necessary, and to be paid compensation in accordance with article 7.
The compensation payable under article 7 is at a standard rate (which varies according to the length of the flight), regardless of the personal circumstances of the passengers and the amount of any actual loss suffered by them individually.
The most recent decision is that of the Grand Chamber in Nelson v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (Joined Cases C 581/10 and C 629/10), [2013] 1 CMLR 1191.
Reiterating the courts reasoning in earlier cases beginning with R (IATA and ELFAA) v Department of Transport (Case C 344/04)[2006] ECR I 403, the court held that the scheme established by Regulation 261/2004 for standardised redress was a form of protection supplementary to, and not incompatible with, the Montreal Convention because it did not affect the right of a passenger to bring a claim for compensation for individual damage suffered by him or the limitations imposed by the Convention on the right to redress on an individual basis.
Analysis
It is convenient to begin by clearing the ground.
There is no dispute about the meaning of the EC Disability Regulation or its compatibility with the Montreal Convention, to which the EU is a party and which is incorporated into the Montreal Regulation.
The EC Disability Regulation imposes obligations on air carriers and others who operate in the air services market to provide equal access to such services for disabled persons and others with reduced mobility for any reason.
It leaves enforcement to the Member States.
It requires Member States to lay down rules on penalties for infringement but it does not require such penalties to include financial compensation.
There is similarly no dispute about the meaning of the UK Disability Regulations or their compatibility with the Montreal Convention.
If the airline is right in its contention that Mr Stotts claim for damages is precluded by article 29 of the Montreal Convention, it follows that the wording of regulation 9(2) is misleading, because it states (supposedly for the avoidance of doubt) that any damages awarded in respect of any infringement of the EC Regulation may include compensation for injury to feelings.
It has rightly not been argued that regulation 9(2) should be read as purporting to create a power to award such damages, if it would be inconsistent with article 29, for that would be ultra vires.
The effect of regulation 9 is to make it clear that the Regulations are capable of giving rise to an action for breach of statutory duty, for which damages are unrestricted by the Regulation, but it does not (and could not) remove any limitation resulting from the Montreal Convention.
The European case law does not assist Mr Stott.
The question in the cases about Regulation (EC) 261/2004 was whether the scheme of standardised remedial measures was compatible with the Montreal Convention.
The court recognised that any claim for damages on an individual basis would be subject to the limits of the Convention (IATA para 42).
Mr Stotts claim is for damages on an individual basis.
To summarise, this case is not about the interpretation or application of a European regulation, and it does not in truth involve a question of European law, notwithstanding that the Montreal Convention has effect through the Montreal Regulation.
The question at issue is whether the claim is outside the substantive scope and/or temporal scope of the Montreal Convention, and that depends entirely on the proper interpretation of the scope of that Convention.
The governing principles are those of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
If the issue concerned the compatibility of the Regulation with the Convention (as in Nelson) it would indeed involve a question of European law, but no such question arises and there is no basis for supposing that the Montreal Convention should be given a different European meaning from its meaning as an international convention.
On the contrary, it was the acknowledged purpose of the Regulation to ensure full alignment between the Convention as an international instrument and community law.
The temporal question can be answered by reference to the facts pleaded and found.
The claim was for damages for the humiliation and distress which Mr Stott suffered in the course of embarkation and flight, as pleaded in his particulars of claim and set out in paras 6 to 8 of the recorders judgment.
The particulars of injury to Mr Stotts feelings and the particulars of aggravated damages related exclusively to events on the aircraft.
In the course of argument it was suggested that Mr Stott had a complete cause of action before boarding the aircraft based on his poor treatment prior to that stage.
If so, it would of course follow that such a pre existing claim would not be barred by the Montreal Convention, but that was not the claim advanced.
Mr Stotts subjection to humiliating and disgraceful maltreatment which formed the gravamen of his claim was squarely within the temporal scope of the Montreal Convention.
It is no answer to the application of the Convention that the operative causes began prior to embarkation.
To hold otherwise would encourage deft pleading in order to circumvent the purpose of the Convention.
Many if not most accidents or mishaps on an aircraft are capable of being traced back to earlier operative causes and it would distort the broad purpose of the Convention explained by Lord Hope in Sidhu to hold that it does not apply to an accident or occurrence in the course of international carriage by air if its cause can be traced back to an antecedent fault.
Should a claim for damages for ill treatment in breach of equality laws as a general class, or, more specifically, should a claim for damages for failure to provide properly for the needs of a disabled passenger, be regarded as outside the substantive scope of the Convention? As to the general question, my answer is no for the reasons given by Sotomayor CJ in King v American Airlines.
I agree with her analysis that what matters is not the quality of the cause of action but the time and place of the accident or mishap.
The Convention is intended to deal comprehensively with the carriers liability for whatever may physically happen to passengers between embarkation and disembarkation.
The answer to that general question also covers the more specific question.
Mr Allen submitted that the consequences were unfair, because if Mr Stott and his wife had not been misled at the check in desk into believing that their seating problem would be sorted out at the departure gate, they would never have proceeded and they would have been able to recover damages for their loss.
The complaint is just, but that is not a sufficient reason to reinterpret the Convention.
The underlying problem is that the Warsaw Convention long pre dated equality laws which are common today.
There is much to be said for the argument that it is time for the Montreal Convention to be amended to take account of the development of equality rights, whether in relation to race (as in King v American Airlines) or in relation to access for the disabled, but any amendment would be a matter for the contracting parties.
It seems unfair that a person who suffers ill treatment of the kind suffered by Mr Stott should be denied any compensation.
Under the law as it stands, a declaration that the carrier was in breach of the UK Regulations is likely to be small comfort to a passenger who has had Mr Stotts experience, but I draw attention, as did Sotomayor CJ at the end of her opinion in King v American Airlines, to the fact that there are other possible means of enforcement.
It is for the Civil Aviation Authority to decide what other methods of enforcement should be used, including possible criminal proceedings.
Conclusion
The embarrassment and humiliation which Mr Stott suffered were exactly what the EC and UK Disability Regulations were intended to prevent.
I share the regret of the lower courts that damages are not available as recompense for his ill treatment and echo their sympathy for him, but I agree with the reasoning of their judgments and would dismiss this appeal.
I would not make a reference to the CJEU for two reasons.
As I have explained, I do not consider that the questions of interpretation of the Montreal Convention on which the appeal turns are properly to be regarded as questions of European law merely because the Convention takes effect via the Montreal Regulation.
Secondly and in any event, I consider the answer to be plain.
LADY HALE
Mr and Mrs Stott have both been treated disgracefully by Thomas Cook and it is hardly less disgraceful that, for the reasons given by Lord Toulson, the law gives them no redress against the airline.
The apparently adamant exclusion, in article 29 of the Montreal Convention, of any liability for damages other than that specifically provided for in the Convention, while perhaps unsurprising in a trade treaty, is more surprising when the fundamental rights of individuals are involved.
Some treaties make express exception for anything which conflicts with the fundamental rights protected within a member state, but the Montreal Convention does not.
Whatever may be the case for private carriers, can it really be the case that a State airline is absolved from any liability in damages for violating the fundamental human rights of the passengers it carries?
The most obvious example is an airline which requires black or female passengers to sit at the back of the plane while white or male passengers sit at the front (and thus nearer to the exit).
This would be unconstitutional in most civilised countries.
Indeed, there is a respectable argument that race (but not sex) discrimination is not only contrary to customary international law, as well as to many international human rights instruments, but also contravenes a peremptory norm of international law which is binding on all states (see R (European Roma Rights Centre) v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport (United Nations High Comr for Refugees intervening) [2004] UKHL 55, [2005] 2 AC 1, per Lord Steyn at para 46).
If it were, then any treaty conflicting with that norm at the time of its conclusion would be void, at least to that extent, by virtue of article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties; and if a new peremptory norm of international law emerges, then any existing treaty which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates, at least to that extent, by virtue of article 64 of the Vienna Convention.
More important still, it might be thought, is the prohibition of torture.
This is indeed a peremptory norm.
There is a respectable case to be made that what happened to Mr Stott on board the plane amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (see, for example, the case of Price v United Kingdom (2002) 34 EHRR 1285, concerning the conditions in which a severely disabled woman was held in police custody).
It seems extraordinary that a State should be able to subject a passenger to such treatment with impunity.
However, it may well be that the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment has not yet reached the status of a peremptory norm in general international law, even though torture in the narrower sense defined in the Torture Convention of 1984 has done so.
None of this was ventilated before us, no doubt for the good reason that Thomas Cook is not a State airline.
The extent to which international law imposes positive obligations upon States to protect individuals against violations of their fundamental rights by non state actors is controversial.
There may or may not be something in the issues I have raised.
But the question of whether there are indeed any limits to the apparently adamant exclusion in article 29 of the Montreal Convention may well require ventilation in another case or another place.
At the very least, as Lord Toulson says, the unfairness of the present position ought to be addressed by the parties to the Convention.
Small comfort though it may be to them, both Mr and Mrs Stott, with the support not only of the Equality and Human Rights Commission but also of the responsible department of the United Kingdom government, have done us all a service by exposing a grave injustice to which the international community should now be turning its attention.
","Mr and Mrs Stott decided to take a holiday in Zante, Greece, in September 2008.
Mr Stott is paralysed from the shoulders down and a permanent wheelchair user.
He has double incontinence and uses a catheter.
When travelling by air, he depends on his wife to manage his incontinence, help him to eat, and change his sitting position.
Mr Stott booked return flights with Thomas Cook Tour Operators Ltd (Thomas Cook), a tour operator and air carrier.
He telephoned Thomas Cooks helpline twice, informing them that he had paid to be seated with his wife, and was assured that this would happen.
However, on arrival at check in for the return journey, Mr and Mrs Stott were told that they would not be seated together.
They protested, but were eventually told that the seat allocations could not be changed.
Mr Stott had difficulties in boarding the aircraft, and was not sufficiently assisted by Thomas Cook staff.
He felt extremely embarrassed, humiliated, and angry.
He was eventually helped into his seat, with his wife sitting behind him.
This arrangement was problematic, since Mrs Stott could not properly assist her husband during the three hour and twenty minute flight.
She had to kneel or crouch in the aisle to attend to his personal needs, obstructing the cabin crew and other passengers.
The cabin crew made no attempt to ease their difficulties.
Mr Stott, assisted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, brought a claim under the Civil Aviation (Access to Air Travel for Disabled Persons and Persons with Reduced Mobility) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/1895) (the UK Regulations), which implement EC disability rights regulations (the EC Regulations).
The UK Regulations enable civil proceedings in UK courts for breaches of the EC Regulations, and state that compensation awarded may include sums for injury to feelings.
The EC Regulations require Community air carriers (among other things) to make reasonable efforts to provide accompanying persons with a seat next to a disabled person.
Mr Stott claimed that Thomas Cook had breached this duty, and sought a declaration and damages for injury to his feelings.
Thomas Cook argued that it had made reasonable efforts and that the Montreal Convention (the Convention), an international treaty which governs the liability of air carriers in international carriage by air, precluded a damages award for injury to feelings.
Under Articles 17 and 29 of the Convention, damages can only be awarded for harm to passengers in cases of death or bodily injury.
The judge at trial found that Thomas Cook had breached the UK Regulations, and made a declaration to that effect.
However, he held that the Convention prevented him from making any damages award to Mr Stott.
The Court of Appeal agreed.
Mr Stott appealed, arguing that his claim was (i) outside the substantive scope of the Convention, since the Convention did not touch the issue of equal access to air travel which are governed by the EC Regulations and (ii) outside the temporal scope of the Convention, since Thomas Cooks failure to make all reasonable efforts began before Mr and Mrs Stott boarded the aircraft.
He relied on EU cases discussing a different EU Regulation which required compensation and assistance for
passengers in the event of cancellations and delays: the European Court had held that this Regulation was not incompatible with the Convention.
The Secretary of State for Transport intervened to support Mr Stotts claim on the second (temporal) ground.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.
The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Toulson, with a concurring judgment by Lady Hale.
Mr Stott was treated in a humiliating and disgraceful manner by Thomas Cook.
However, his claim falls within the substantive and temporal scope of the Convention, and as a result damages cannot be awarded for injury to feelings.
Substantively, the Convention deals comprehensively with the carriers liability for physical incidents involving passengers between embarkation and disembarkation.
The fact that Mr Stotts claim involves an EU law right makes no difference.
Temporally, Mr Stotts claim is for damages and distress suffered in the course of embarkation and flight, and these fall squarely within the temporal scope of the Convention.
It is not enough that the operative causes began prior to boarding.
The only true question in the case is whether Mr Stotts claim falls within the scope of the Montreal Convention.
There is no dispute between Mr Stott and Thomas Cook as to the interpretation of the EC Regulations or UK Regulations, or their compatibility with the Convention.
The EU cases do not assist: that other Regulation concerned general standardised measures, and the European Court had recognised that any claim for individualised damages would be subject to the Convention.
The case raised no question of European law [54 59].
On substantive scope: the Convention was intended to deal comprehensively with the liability of the air carrier for whatever might physically happen to passengers between embarkation or disembarkation.
The fact that Mr Stotts claim relates to disability discrimination makes no difference.
The underlying difficulty is that the Montreal Convention and its predecessors long pre dated equality laws.
It is unfair that someone suffering as Mr Stott had could not obtain any compensation, but that is the plain meaning of the Convention.
It would be desirable for the states parties to the Convention to consider its amendment.
It is also possible that the Civil Aviation Authority could take other enforcement actions against Thomas Cook [61 64].
On temporal scope: the operative causes of Mr Stotts treatment undoubtedly began at check in, prior to embarkation.
However, this is not enough.
Mr Stotts claim is for damages for the humiliation and distress that Mr Stott had suffered during the course of the flight, which fall squarely within the Convention period of exclusivity.
To hold otherwise would encourage deft pleading and would circumvent the purpose of the Convention [60].
In her concurring judgment, Lady Hale considers it disturbing that the Convention excludes damages claims for breaches of individuals fundamental rights.
It is particularly unsettling that this applies not only to private air carriers such as Thomas Cook, but also to state airlines.
A treaty which contravened a fundamental international law norm would be void.
Torture is a fundamental norm of this kind, and race discrimination might be another.
There is a respectable view that Mr Stotts treatment would, under the European Convention on Human Rights, constitute inhuman and degrading treatment (IDT).
However, it appears that IDT has not yet become a fundamental international law norm.
Since Thomas Cook is not a state air carrier, these issues do not arise in this case.
At the very least, however, the grave injustice done to those in Mr Stotts position should be addressed by the parties to the Convention [67 70].
"
uksc-2013-0161,"These appeals are brought by a Polish national, Roksana Mirga, and an Austrian national, Wadi Samin, against decisions of the Court of Appeal upholding determinations that they were not entitled to certain benefits, namely income support and housing assistance respectively, pursuant to the provisions of United Kingdom domestic law.
The arguments have changed somewhat over the course of the two sets of proceedings, but the essential issue raised now is whether the provisions and the current implementation of the domestic law in question infringe the rights of residence in the UK of citizens of European Union member states.
Shortly before this judgment was to be delivered, counsel for the appellants informed us of an Opinion which had been delivered by Advocate General Wathelet in Jobcenter Berlin Neuklln v Alimanovic (Case C 67/14) [2016] 2 WLR 208, which they contended assisted their arguments.
We decided to await the judgment of the Court of Justice in that case.
Judgment was given on 15 September 2015, and the parties have had the opportunity to make written submissions as to its effect on these appeals.
It should perhaps be added that, after we received those further submissions, the appellants counsel drew to our attention Advocate General Cruz Villalns Opinion in European Commission v United Kingdom (Case C 308/14), and suggested that we await the judgment of the Court of Justice in that case, or alternatively that we refer these two cases to that court.
In my opinion, following the judgment in Alimanovic, any issue on which we have to rule in these appeals is acte clar, and accordingly we should now determine these two appeals.
The factual background
The facts relating to Ms Mirga
Ms Mirga was born in 1988 in Poland.
In 1998, she came to this country with her parents and three siblings, but they returned to Poland in 2002 after being refused asylum.
Two years later, in June 2004, on Polands accession to the EU, the family returned to the UK.
Sadly, her mother died four months later, and her father, who had been working, gave up his job owing to depression a few months afterwards.
He received income support until late 2007, when it was decided that he should not have been receiving it, on the ground that he did not have the right of residence in the UK.
Meanwhile, Ms Mirga finished her education in April 2005 and embarked on registered work within the meaning of the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1219) (the A8 Regulations).
She continued with that registered work until November 2005.
In February 2006, she became pregnant and started to do unregistered work, which she continued for two months or so.
In June 2006, she left home for rented accommodation, and did a months further unregistered work around June 2006.
In August 2006, she claimed income support under the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (SI 1987/1967) (the Income Support Regulations) on the grounds of her pregnancy.
Her baby son was born in October 2006.
The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions refused Ms Mirgas application for income support, and his decision was upheld by the First tier Tribunal, whose decision was affirmed, albeit for different reasons, by Judge Rowland in the Upper Tribunal.
The Upper Tribunal decided that the Secretary of State was entitled to refuse Ms Mirgas application because she did not have a right of residence in the UK under the A8 Regulations and therefore was excluded from the ambit of income support by virtue of the Income Support Regulations.
The Upper Tribunals decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a judgment given by Laws LJ, with which Tomlinson LJ and Sir David Keene agreed [2012] EWCA Civ 1952.
The facts relating to Mr Samin
Mr Samin was born in Iraq in 1960.
After ten years military service, he successfully sought asylum in Austria in 1992, together with his wife and children, and he was accorded Austrian citizenship the following year.
Sadly, he became wholly estranged from his wife and children, and he came to the UK in December 2005, since when he has lived in this country on his own.
During the ten months following his entry into the UK, he had some paid employment on occasions, often part time, but he has not worked since some time in 2006, and has not been looking for work since 2007.
Mr Samin is socially isolated and suffers from poor mental health, principally from clinical depression and post traumatic stress disorder.
Having attempted to kill himself in the past, he remains a moderately high risk of suicide in the medium term.
He also suffers from diabetes, hypertension and kidney stones, and he needs physiotherapy.
After occupying temporary accommodation, Mr Samin lived in a studio flat in North London, which he had to vacate after four years in June 2010.
He then applied to Westminster City Council (the Council) for housing under the homelessness provisions in Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (the Housing Act).
After making inquiries, the Council decided that he was a person from abroad who is not eligible for housing assistance within the meaning of section 185(1) of the Housing Act, because he did not have the right of residence in the UK under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) (the EEA Regulations).
That decision was affirmed in the Central London County Court by His Honour Judge Mitchell, whose decision was in turn upheld by the Court of Appeal for reasons given by Hughes LJ, with which Etherton and Tomlinson LJJ agreed [2012] EWCA Civ 1468; [2012] WLR(D) 336.
The legislative background
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
Under article 18 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), any discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited in so far as it is [w]ithin the scope of application of the Treaties.
The importance of avoiding discrimination is emphasised by article 19 of TFEU which states that the Council may take appropriate action to combat discrimination .
Article 20 of TFEU states in para 1 that every national of an EU member state shall be a citizen of the Union, and, in para 2(a), that citizens of the Union should have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states, albeit that that right is to be exercised in accordance with the conditions and limits defined by the Treaties and by the measures adopted thereunder.
Article 21.1 of TFEU provides as follows: Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and in the measures adopted to give them effect.
Article 45 of TFEU, which is also concerned with freedom of movement for workers, requires the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the member states as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.
The 2003 Accession Treaty
In 2004, ten countries, including Poland, acceded to the EU pursuant to the Treaty on Accession 2003 (the 2003 Accession Treaty).
By virtue of articles 10 and 24 of the Act of Accession forming the second part of the Treaty, existing member states, including the UK, were accorded, by way of derogation, certain transitional powers.
Those powers included a right to derogate in relation to the free movement of workers within the EU, which was then governed by Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 (the 1968 Regulation), in relation to nationals (known as A8 nationals) of eight of the ten new member states.
Those powers of derogation in relation to Polish nationals were contained in paragraphs 1 14 of Part 2 of Annex 12 to the 2003 Accession Treaty.
So long as these provisions were in force, they enabled a host member state to exclude Polish nationals from freedom of movement rights unless they had been working in that state for an uninterrupted period of 12 months following accession.
The 2004 Directive
The right of EU nationals to reside in all member states of the EU has been qualified and regulated by EU Instruments, most notably by the 1968 Regulation and by Directive 2004/38/EC of 30 April 2004 (the 2004 Directive), which made substantial amendments to the 1968 Regulation.
The 2004 Directive is concerned with the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states.
The preamble to the 2004 Directive includes the following: (10) Persons exercising their right of residence should not become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host member state during an initial period of residence.
Therefore, the right of residence for Union citizens and their family members for periods in excess of three months should be subject to conditions. (16) As long as the beneficiaries of the right of residence do not become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host member state they should not be expelled.
Therefore, an expulsion measure should not be the automatic consequence of recourse to the social assistance system.
The host member state should examine whether it is a case of temporary difficulties and take into account the duration of residence, the personal circumstances and the amount of aid granted in order to consider whether the beneficiary has become an unreasonable burden on its social assistance system and to proceed to his expulsion.
In no case should an expulsion measure be adopted against workers, self employed persons or job seekers as defined by the Court of Justice save on grounds of public policy or public security.
Recital (31) emphasises that the 2004 Directive should be implemented in a non discriminatory way.
Article 6 states that Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another member state for a period of up to three months without any conditions or any formalities, and that the right extends to family members.
Article 7 is concerned with the Right of Residence for more than three months, and it starts as follows: 1.
All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another member state for a period of longer than three months if they: are workers or self employed persons in the host (a) member state; or (b) have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host member state during their period of residence and have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host member state.
Para 1(c) of article 7 deals with students, and para 1(d) and para 2 deal with family members.
Article 7.3 provides that a person does not lose the status of a worker or self employed person on ceasing to work in certain circumstances.
Those circumstances include (a) if he or she is temporarily unable to work as the result of an illness or accident, and (b) if he or she has been employed for more than a year, is involuntarily unemployed and has registered as a job seeker.
Article 8 is concerned with Administrative formalities for Union citizens, and articles 8.1 and 8.2 deal with the right of member states to require Union citizens residing for more than three months to register with the relevant authorities.
Articles 8.3 and 8.4 include the following: 3.
For the registration certificate to be issued, member states may only require that: Union citizens to whom point (b) of article 7(1) applies present a valid identity card or passport and provide proof that they satisfy the conditions laid down therein; 4.
Member states may not lay down a fixed amount which they regard as sufficient resources but they must take into account the personal situation of the person concerned.
In all cases this amount shall not be higher than the threshold below which nationals of the host member state become eligible for social assistance, or, where this criterion is not applicable, higher than the minimum social security pension paid by the host member state.
Article 14.1 states that the three months right of residence under article 6 applies as long as [the citizen and his or her family] do not become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host member state.
Article 14.2 provides that Union citizens and their family members have the right of residence provided for in [article 7] as long as they meet the conditions set out therein.
But article 14.3 states that an expulsion measure should not be the automatic consequence of recourse to the social assistance system.
Article 14.4 provides that an expulsion measure shall not be adopted against Union citizens who (a) are workers or self employed persons, or (b) entered the host state to seek employment and can provide evidence that they are continuing to seek employment and that they have a genuine chance of being engaged.
Article 24.1 states that all Union citizens residing on the basis of this Directive in the territory of the host member state shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of that member state, albeit subject to such specific provisions as are expressly provided for in the Treaty and secondary law.
Article 24.2 specifically entitles a member state to refuse social assistance during the first three months of residence, or, where appropriate, the longer period provided for in article 14(4)(b).
Article 28 is concerned with Protection against expulsion, and para 1 provides that: Before taking an expulsion decision on grounds of public policy or public security, the host member state shall take account of considerations such as how long the individual concerned has resided on its territory, his/her age, state of health, family and economic situation, social and cultural integration into the host member state and the extent of his/her links with the country of origin.
Articles 30 and 31 are concerned with protecting the rights that are the subject of the Directive (and the width of their ambit is emphasised by article 15.1).
Article 30 deals with notification, and article 31 deals with Procedural safeguards, including access to judicial redress procedures.
Domestic legislation: the EEA Regulations
On 30 April 2006, the EEA Regulations came into force in the United Kingdom.
They were, as the Explanatory Note explains, intended to implement the 2004 Directive.
Regulation 13 of the EEA Regulations provides that all EEA nationals have the right to reside in the UK for three months.
Regulation 14 provides that a qualified person is entitled to remain in the UK so long as he is so qualified.
Regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations defines what is meant by qualified person.
It includes a jobseeker, a worker, a self employed person, a self sufficient person, and a student.
Regulation 4, which has been amended on various occasions, is concerned with definitions of most of those expressions, including worker and self sufficient person.
Regulation 4(1)(a) defines worker by reference to the TFEU.
Regulations 5 and 15 certain workers who [have] ceased activity have a permanent right of residence, and they include (2) those who have retired having worked in the UK for at least 12 months and resided there for at least three years, and (3) those who have stopped working as a result of permanent incapacity, having resided in the UK for at least two years.
Regulation 6 extends qualified person status to people who are temporarily no longer working owing to illness or accident, or who worked but are now involuntarily unemployed and registered as jobseekers (but only for six months if they were employed for less than a year), or who have lost their jobs and are in vocational training.
Regulation 4(1)(c) of the EEA Regulations provides that: self sufficient person means a person who has i) sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the United Kingdom during his period of residence; and ii) United Kingdom.
comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the
Regulation 4(2), (3) and (4) contain further provisions dealing with what constitutes sufficient resources, but only para (4) is of any relevance in these proceedings.
It has been amended at least twice.
Ignoring references to family members which are irrelevant in these two cases, regulation 4(4) now provides that resources are to be regarded as sufficient if (a) they exceed the maximum level which a British citizen may possess if he is to become eligible for social assistance in the UK, or (b) taking into account the personal situation of the person concerned it appears that [his] resources should be regarded as sufficient.
The paragraph originally only included what is now sub para (a), and sub para (b) was added in 2011.
Regulation 19 of the EEA Regulations is concerned with refusal of admission and removal, and para 3 provides that a person who has been admitted into, or acquired a right to reside in, the UK may be removed if he does not have or ceases to have a right to reside.
However regulation 19(4) states that a person cannot be removed as an automatic consequence of having recourse to the social assistance system of the [UK].
Domestic legislation: the A8 Regulations
Pursuant to the terms of the 2003 Accession Treaty, the European Union (Accessions) Act 2003 was enacted, which, under section 2, permitted the Secretary of State to make the A8 Regulations (which were revoked in May 2011).
Regulations 2 and 5 of the A8 Regulations provided that A8 nationals would only have full access to the UK labour market if they had been in registered employment under the Worker Registration Scheme for a continuous period of 12 months.
The consequence was that, so long as the A8 Regulations were in force, A8 nationals could not become qualifying persons under the EEA Regulations unless and until they had performed registered employment for a continuous period of at least 12 months.
Domestic legislation: income support
Entitlement to income support arises under section 124 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the Income Support Regulations.
In very summary terms, income support is available for certain people provided that they are not engaged in relevant work or receiving relevant education, and their income is below the applicable amount.
The effect of regulation 21 of the Income Support Regulations, however, is that a person from abroad is to be treated as having an applicable amount of nil, and is therefore not eligible for income support.
Regulation 21AA(1) (3) of the Income Support Regulations states that certain people will be treated as persons from abroad unless they are habitually resident in the UK (and certain other places, including Ireland), and have the right to be so under certain statutory provisions not germane to the present appeals.
Regulation 21AA(4) provides, however, that a person is not a person from abroad if he is, inter alia, a worker (or self employed person, or is to be treated as a worker or self employed person) within the meaning of the 2004 Directive.
Domestic legislation: housing assistance
Part VII of the Housing Act imposes duties on local housing authorities in relation to homeless people.
The duty extends, under section 193, to providing them with accommodation where they are involuntarily homeless and in priority need unless they are not eligible for assistance.
Eligibility for assistance is dealt with in section 185 of the Housing Act, which provides, inter alia, that a person who is subject to immigration control is ineligible for housing assistance unless of a class prescribed by regulations, along with any other person from abroad treated as ineligible by virtue of regulations.
The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1294) (the Eligibility Regulations) define the classes of persons subject to immigration control who are eligible for housing assistance and the classes of other persons from abroad who are ineligible, and the effect of regulations 2(2) and 6(2) is that a person from abroad is eligible if he is a worker for the purposes of the definition of a qualified person in regulation 6(1) of the EEA Regulations.
The issues raised on these appeals
Mr Coppel QC and Ms Rogers, on behalf of the Secretary of State, contend that, at the time that Ms Mirga applied for income support, she was ineligible for income support under the Income Support Regulations, because she was a person from abroad.
This was on the basis that she could not claim to be a worker as she was an A8 national who had not done 12 months registered employment (under the A8 Regulations), and thus could not be a qualifying person for the purpose of the EEA Regulations.
Even if the A8 Regulations did not apply, Mr Coppel argues that Ms Mirga would still not have been a worker, as the EEA Regulations would have required her to have worked for at least 12 months before she claimed income support.
There is no question of Ms Mirga having been a jobseeker, a self employed person, or a student under the EEA Regulations.
Further, it seems clear that Ms Mirga could not claim to be a self sufficient person under the EEA Regulations, as she had no significant means of support and no health insurance (but if she had had been a self sufficient person she would presumably not have needed income support anyway).
With the support of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Mr Peacock contends for the Council that Mr Samin is not a worker within the EEA Regulations because he is now permanently incapable of work, and in any event he cannot claim to be a worker because he has not worked for 12 months in the UK.
Accordingly, argues Mr Peacock, Mr Samin is not a qualified person under the EEA Regulations, from which it follows that he is ineligible for the purposes of the Housing Act.
It is also said that Mr Samin cannot claim to be a self sufficient person within the EEA Regulations because he has no assets and no health insurance.
The first argument raised by Mr Drabble QC, who appears with Ms Leventhal on behalf of Ms Mirga, is that, in the light of her right to respect for her private and family life, under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, she cannot be removed from the UK, and therefore her right of residence in the UK, as accorded by article 21.1 of TFEU, cannot be limited or cut back in the way that the Income Support Regulations seek to do, namely by restricting her rights to income support because she has not achieved a continuous 12 month period in registered employment.
His alternative argument is that, even if it would be permissible to refuse Ms Mirga income support on that ground, it is only possible in practice if it would be proportionate to do so, and in particular if the grant of income support to her would place an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the UK, and there has been no inquiry into that question.
The first argument raised on behalf of Mr Samin by Mr Drabble, appearing with Mr Carter and Mr Cowan, is that the refusal of housing assistance to Mr Samin constituted unlawful discrimination in breach of article 18 of the TFEU, even though he may not have had a right of residence in the UK.
The alternative argument raised on behalf of Mr Samin reflects the alternative argument in Ms Mirgas case, namely that there should have been an investigation as to whether it was proportionate to refuse Mr Samin housing assistance, in particular on the ground that it represented an unreasonable burden of the UK social assistance system.
Mr Drabbles arguments were supported by Ms Demetriou QC, assisted by Mr Banner and Ms MacLeod, on behalf of The AIRE Centre, and it is right to record the courts appreciation of their pro bono work in this case, and their assistance to the court.
Discussion Issue one: do the domestic Regulations infringe the appellants TFEU rights?
Mr Drabbles first contention on behalf of Ms Mirga is that, as she is a worker (albeit one whose work was temporarily interrupted owing to her pregnancy), article 21.1 of TFEU accords her the right to reside freely within the EU, and therefore within the UK, and that the denial of income support to her, at a time when she needed it in order to be able to live in the UK, was an impermissible interference with that right, as she would, in practice, be forced to return to Poland.
That argument can be said to reflect the fundamental importance of freedom of movement and freedom of establishment to the single market concept, as well as the significance attached in articles 18 and 19 of TFEU to the avoidance of discrimination between citizens of a member state and other EU nationals.
A similar argument cannot be run in relation to Mr Samin, because it is now accepted that owing to his inability to work he cannot claim to be a worker, even in the light of the extended definition in article 7.3 of the 2004 Directive and regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations.
Accordingly, Mr Drabbles first line of argument on behalf of Mr Samin is that the Councils refusal to provide Mr Samin with housing assistance under Part VII of the Housing Act constituted discrimination on grounds of nationality prohibited by article 18 of TFEU, because such assistance would have been accorded to a citizen of the UK, or a qualifying worker from another member state, who was otherwise in the same position as Mr Samin.
It seems to me that these arguments face real difficulties.
The right accorded by article 21.1 of TFEU, which is relied on by Ms Mirga, although fundamental and broad, is qualified by the words subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and in the measures adopted to give them effect.
In the present case, the measures include the 2004 Directive, and presumably include the 2003 Accession Treaty, which was adopted under article 49 of the Treaty on European Union.
It appears clear from the terms of paragraph 10 of the preamble that it was a significant aim of the 2004 Directive that EU nationals from one member state should not be able to exercise their rights of residence in another member state so as to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system.
It also seems clear that any right of residence after three months can be subject to conditions.
This is reflected in the terms of article 7.1, in that it limits the right of residence after three months to those who are workers, self employed, students, or with sufficient resources and health insurance not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host member state.
Indeed, it is worth noting that article 14.1 even limits the right of residence in the first three months.
It further appears clear from article 24, that EU nationals right of equal treatment in host member states is subject to secondary law, and in particular that they can be refused social assistance where appropriate.
Accordingly, when one turns to the 2003 Accession Treaty and the 2004 Directive, I consider that, because Ms Mirga has not done 12 months work in this country, she cannot claim to be a worker, and, because she is not a jobseeker, self employed, a student, or self sufficient, it would seem to follow that she can be validly denied a right of residence in the UK, and therefore can be excluded from social assistance.
In those circumstances, it must follow that article 21.1 TFEU cannot assist her.
The fact that Ms Mirga may have to cease living in the UK to seek assistance in Poland does not appear to me to assist her argument.
Although the refusal of social assistance may cause her to leave the UK, there would be no question of her being expelled from this country.
I find it hard to read the 2004 Directive as treating refusal of social assistance as constituting a species of constructive expulsion even if it results in the person concerned leaving the host member state.
As I see it, the Directive distinguishes between the right of residence and the act of expulsion.
However, quite apart from this, the Directive makes it clear that the right of residence is not to be invoked simply to enable a national of one member state to obtain social assistance in another member state.
On the contrary: the right of residence is not intended to be available too easily to those who need social assistance from the host member state.
Mr Samins first argument appears to me to face similar difficulties.
The article 18 right which he relies on does not constitute a broad or general right not to be discriminated against.
First, its ambit is limited to the scope of the Treaties, which means that it only comes into play where there is discrimination in connection with a right in the TFEU or another EU Treaty.
Secondly, the article 18 right is without prejudice to any special provisions contained [in the Treaties].
That brings one back to the argument raised on behalf of Ms Mirga.
Contrary to the appellants argument, I do not consider that the decision of the Third Chamber in Pensionsversicherungsanstalt v Brey (Case C 140/12) [2014] 1 WLR 1080 provides the appellants with much assistance.
However, it is unnecessary to consider that possibility, because it seems to me clear that the first point raised by each appellant must be rejected as acte clar following the recent Grand Chamber judgments in Dano and another v Jobcenter Leipzig (Case C 333/13) [2015] 1 WLR 2519 (which was published after the Court of Appeal decided these cases) and in Alimanovic (Case C 67/14) EU:C:2015:597, which, as mentioned above, was published some time after the hearing of these appeals.
It is appropriate to set out in summary terms the effect of those three decisions, not least because they have relevance to the second issue raised on behalf of each appellant, as well as the first.
In Brey, the applicant was a German national residing in Austria, who received a German pension and care allowance insufficient for his needs, and who was refused a compensatory supplement from the Austrian government, because he did not meet the necessary national residency requirements, which excluded those who did not have sufficient resources not to be a burden on the Austrian social security system.
Shortly after that refusal, the Austrian government issued the applicant with an EEA citizen registration certificate.
The question referred to the Court of Justice by the Austrian Oberster Gerichtshof was whether article 7(1)(b) of Directive 2004/38 should be interpreted as meaning that, for the purposes of that provision, the concept of social assistance covers a benefit such as the compensatory supplement (para 26).
The Chamber ruled, at para 80, that the 2004 Directive precluded national legislation which automatically whatever the circumstances bars the grant of a benefit, such as the compensatory supplement to a national of another member state who is not economically active, on the grounds that, despite having been issued with a certificate of residence, he does not meet the necessary requirements for obtaining the legal right to reside since obtaining that right of residence is conditional on that national having sufficient resources not to apply for the benefit.
In Dano, the applicant and her son were Romanian nationals living in Germany (where the son had been born), and she had been issued with an unlimited residence certificate.
The applicant neither had worked nor was looking for work, and she and her son were refused maintenance payments.
The Sozialgericht Leipzig referred a number of questions to the Court of Justice, and the Grand Chamber concluded that article 24 of the 2004 Directive and article 4 of Regulation 883/2004 (which concerns the coordination of social security systems, and includes a similar anti discrimination provision to the 2004 Directive): must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a member state under which nationals of other member states are excluded from entitlement to certain special non contributory cash benefits within the meaning of article 70(2) of Regulation 883/2004, although those benefits are granted to nationals of the host member state who are in the same situation, in so far as those nationals of other member states do not have a right of residence under Directive 2004/38 in the host member state. (para 84)
In Alimanovic, Mrs Alimanovic and her three children were Swedish nationals who had gone to Germany and had been issued with a certificate of right to permanent residence.
She and her children were refused subsistence and social allowances, and when they challenged this, the Bundessozialgericht referred three questions to the Court of Justice.
The Grand Chamber ruled, at para 63, that article 24 of the 2004 Directive: must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a member state under which nationals of other member states who are in a situation such as that referred to in article 14(4)(b) of that Directive are excluded from entitlement to certain special non contributory cash benefits within the meaning of article 70(2) of Regulation No 883/2004, which also constitute social assistance within the meaning of article 24(2) of Directive 2004/38, although those benefits are granted to nationals of the member state concerned who are in the same situation.
In para 60 of Dano, the Grand Chamber said that the right granted by article 18 of TFEU was subject to the restrictions I have mentioned in paras 43 and 44 above, and the court referred in support to the decision in Brey, and in particular paras 46ff.
In para 46 of Brey, the Chamber had referred to the right of nationals of one member state to reside in the territory of another members state without being employed or self employed as being not unconditional.
It is also worth noting that the Grand Chamber also referred to article 20 of TFEU and article 24 of the 2004 Directive in terms which made it clear that the rights they grant should, in the instant context, be treated similarly to the rights granted by article 18.
In para 61 of Dano, the Grand Chamber described the right under article 18 of the TFEU as having been given more specific expression in article 24 of [the 2004 Directive].
In para 63, citing Brey, para 61, the court pointed out that if someone has recourse to assistance schemes established by the public authorities, he may during his period of residence, become a burden on the public finances of the host member state which could have consequences for the overall level of assistance which may be granted by that state.
In para 69, it was made clear that a Union citizen can claim equal treatment with nationals of the host member state only if his residence in the territory of the host member state complies with the conditions of [the 2004 Directive].
In para 73, the court summarised the effect of article 7(1) of the 2004 Directive, and said in the following paragraph that, if persons who do not have a right of residence under [the 2004 Directive] may claim entitlement to social benefits under the same conditions as those applicable to nationals [that] would run counter to an objective of the Directive.
In para 76, the purpose of article 7(1)(b) of the 2004 Directive was described as being to prevent economically inactive Union citizens from using the host members states welfare system to fund their means of subsistence.
Finally, in para 80 the Grand Chamber said that a persons financial situation should be examined specifically in order to determine whether he meets the condition of having sufficient resources to qualify under article 7.1(b).
As already mentioned, the authority of the decision in Dano has been reinforced by the decision in Alimanovic, where, in paras 44 and 50 respectively, the Grand Chamber specifically referred to what was said in paras 63 and 69 of the judgment in Dano with approval.
More broadly, as explained more fully below, the Grand Chamber in Alimanovic confirmed that a Union citizen can claim equal treatment with nationals of a country, at least in relation to social assistance, only if he or she can satisfy the conditions for lawful residence in that country.
Thus, it was confirmed that article 24.2 of the 2004 Directive was, in effect, a valid exception to the principle of non discrimination.
Dano and Alimanovic clearly demonstrate that the jurisprudence of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice is inconsistent with Mr Drabbles first argument on behalf of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin, at least in so far as his argument is focussed on the 2004 Directive.
It is fair to say that those cases were not concerned with the 2003 Accession Treaty.
However, the House of Lords concluded in Zalewska v Department for Social Development [2008] 1 WLR 2602 that the A8 Regulations, which reflect the provisions of the 2003 Accession Treaty, were consistent with EU law, and nothing I have heard or read in connection with this appeal casts doubt on that conclusion.
In particular, it appears to be consistent with the reasoning in Brey, Dano and Alimanovic.
The only possible remaining issue in relation to this first set of arguments could be whether (i) in the case of Ms Mirga, the provisions of the Income Support Regulations, when read together with the A8 Regulations and the EEA Regulations, and (ii) in the case of Mr Samin, the provisions of the Eligibility Regulations, when read together with the EEA Regulations, complied with the requirements of the 2003 Accession Treaty and the 2004 Directive.
As I understood his contentions, Mr Drabble did not suggest any discrepancy in the domestic regulations unsurprisingly, as they were clearly intended to implement the EU instruments.
Accordingly, in my judgment, following the clear guidance from the Grand Chamber in Dano and Alimanovic, the first arguments raised on behalf of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin cannot be maintained.
That leaves their alternative arguments raised in the two appeals, based on proportionality.
Issue two: the appellants argument based on lack of proportionality
Mr Drabbles second argument in both appeals is that the determination of the authorities and the courts and tribunals below in the case of both Ms Mirga and Mr Samin was flawed because no consideration was given to the proportionality of refusing each of them social assistance bearing in mind all the circumstances of their respective cases, and in particular that the authority or tribunal concerned failed to address the burden it would place on the system if they were to be accorded the social assistance which they sought.
In that connection, Mr Drabble relied on the Court of Justices decisions in St Prix v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Case C 507/12) [2014] PTSR 1448, Baumbast v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Case C 413/99) [2003] ICR 1347 and Brey.
St Prix was concerned with the question whether a person ceased automatically to be a worker for the purpose of the 2004 Directive, and therefore the EEA Regulations, if she temporarily ceased work owing to the fact that she was pregnant.
It provides no assistance to the appellants arguments as advanced by Mr Drabble, except to emphasise the purposive approach to be adopted to the interpretation of the 2004 Directive.
The effect of the decision of Baumbast is that the fact that an applicant may fall short of the strict requirements of having self sufficiency status under what are now the 2004 Directive and the EEA Regulations cannot always justify the host member state automatically rejecting his or her right to reside on the ground that the requirements for that status are not wholly complied with.
In Baumbast the court was concerned, inter alia, with the issue whether an applicant could exercise the right to reside in the UK in circumstances where he was resting his case on the ground that he was a self sufficient person.
It is clear from paras 88 and 89 of the judgment that the applicant had sufficient resources to be self sufficient in practice, and that he had medical insurance.
His only possible problem was that the insurance may have fallen short of being comprehensive in one respect, namely that it was not clear whether it covered emergency treatment.
The court held that, on the assumption that the insurance fell short in this connection, it would nonetheless be disproportionate to deprive the applicant of his right to reside.
In para 92, the court pointed out that there were strong factors in the applicants favour, namely that he had sufficient resources, that he had worked and resided in the UK for several years, that his family had also resided in the UK for several years, that he and his family had never received any social assistance, and that he and his family had comprehensive medical insurance in Germany.
In those circumstances, the court said in para 93 that it would be a disproportionate interference with the exercise of the applicants right of residence conferred by what is now article 21.1 of TFEU to refuse to let him stay in the UK because of a small shortfall in the comprehensiveness of his medical insurance.
I do not consider that the appellants derive any assistance from Baumbast.
Mr Baumbasts case was predicated on the fact that he did not need any assistance from the state.
Even if the decision is relied on by analogy, it is of no help to the appellants.
The thrust of the courts reasoning in that case was that, where an applicants failure to meet the requirements of being a self sufficient person was very slight, his links with the host member state were particularly strong, and his claim was particularly meritorious, it would be disproportionate to reject his claim to enjoy the right of residence in that host state.
Even though the applicant had a very strong case in the sense that he fell short of the self sufficiency requirements in one very small respect, the court decided that he could rely on disproportionality only after considering the position in some detail.
Mr Drabbles argument appears to derive greater assistance from some of the reasoning of the Third Chamber in Brey, where the Third Chamber held that the complementary supplement was social assistance within the meaning of the 2004 Directive and also that it was open to member states to provide such assistance to economically inactive citizens of other member states in any circumstances.
Crucially, argues Mr Drabble, the Austrian governments refusal of the complementary supplement to the applicant was held to be unlawful.
The central reasoning of the Third Chamber in Brey for present purposes is in paras 75 78.
In para 75, having considered a number of points, the court concluded that the mere fact that a national of a member state receives social assistance is not sufficient to show that he constitutes an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host member state.
In the following paragraph, the court stated that the fact that a non national has applied for the benefit in issue in that case was not sufficient to preclude [him] from receiving it, regardless of the duration of residence, the amount of the benefit, and the period for which it is available.
In para 77, the court made the point that domestic legislation, such as the Austrian law in that case, could not provide that a national of another member state, who was not a worker, self employed or a student, should be automatically barred from receiving a social benefit.
In the next paragraph, the court stated that the competent authorities should be able when examining the application of a Union citizen who is not economically active and is in Mr Breys position to take into account certain factors.
They included the amount and regularity of [the applicants] income, the fact that he had received a certificate of residence, the period for which he would receive the benefit, and the extent of the burden [it] would place on the social security system (which as Advocate General Wathelet said in Dano at paras 111 112 of his Opinion, must be a collective assessment, which was confirmed by the Grand Chamber in para 62 of Alimanovic).
These factors were, the court said in para 78 of the judgment in Brey, for the domestic court to assess.
Brey was an unusual case, because the applicant had been issued with a certificate of residence by the Austrian government, a factor which appears to have played a significant part in the courts thinking, as it was recited in the re formulated question (in para 32) and it is referred to expressly and impliedly in the crucial para 78 of the judgment, and indeed in the final ruling of the Third Chamber (see para 49 above).
However, it is not necessary to address that point further, as it appears to me that the reasoning in Brey cannot assist the appellants on the instant appeals, in the light of the subsequent reasoning of the Grand Chamber in the subsequent decisions in Dano and Alimanovic.
The observations of the Grand Chamber in Dano discussed in para 53 above are in point.
In Alimanovic, para 59, the Grand Chamber specifically mentioned that the court in Brey had stated that a member state [was required] to take account of the individual situation of the person concerned before it finds that the residence of that person is placing an unreasonable burden on its social assistance system.
However, the Grand Chamber went on to say that no such individual assessment is necessary in circumstances such as those in issue in this case.
In para 60, the Grand Chamber explained that: Directive 2004/38, establishing a gradual system as regards the retention of the status of worker which seeks to safeguard the right of residence and access to social assistance, itself takes into consideration various factors characterising the individual situation of each applicant for social assistance and, in particular, the duration of the exercise of any economic activity.
The court then went on to explain that article 7 of the 2004 Directive, when read with other provisions, guarantees a significant level of legal certainty and transparency in the context of the award of social assistance by way of basic provision, while complying with the principle of proportionality. (In this connection, the Grand Chamber took a different view from that taken by Advocate General Wathelet in paras 105 111 of his Opinion, upon which Mr Drabble had understandably relied.)
In my view, this makes good sense: it seems unrealistic to require an individual examination of each particular case.
I note that this was a proposition which the Second Chamber rejected, albeit in a somewhat different (and probably less striking) context, on the ground that the management of the regime concerned must remain technically and economically viable see Dansk Jurist og konomforbund v Indenrigs og Sundshedsministeriet (Case C 546/11) [2014] ICR 1, para 70, which was cited with approval in the present context by Advocate General Wahl in Dano at para 132 of his Opinion.
Where a national of another member state is not a worker, self employed or a student, and has no, or very limited, means of support and no medical insurance (as is sadly the position of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin), it would severely undermine the whole thrust and purpose of the 2004 Directive if proportionality could be invoked to entitle that person to have the right of residence and social assistance in another member state, save perhaps in extreme circumstances.
It would also place a substantial burden on a host member state if it had to carry out a proportionality exercise in every case where the right of residence (or indeed the right against discrimination) was invoked.
Even if there is a category of exceptional cases where proportionality could come into play, I do not consider that either Ms Mirga or Mr Samin could possibly satisfy it.
They were in a wholly different position from Mr Baumbast: he was not seeking social assistance, he fell short of the self sufficiency criteria to a very small extent indeed, and he had worked in this country for many years.
By contrast Ms Mirga and Mr Samin were seeking social assistance, neither of them had any significant means of support or any medical insurance, and neither had worked for sustained periods in this country.
The whole point of their appeals was to enable them to receive social assistance, and at least the main point of the self sufficiency test is to assist applicants who would be very unlikely to need social assistance.
Whatever sympathy one may naturally feel for Ms Mirga and Mr Samin, their respective applications for income support and housing assistance represent precisely what was said by the Grand Chamber in Dano, para 75 (supported by its later reasoning in Alimanovic) to be the aim of the 2004 Directive to stop, namely economically inactive Union citizens using the host member states welfare system to fund their means of subsistence.
Conclusion
I would dismiss both these appeals.
","These two appeals concern the claims of two EU nationals to claim benefits in the United Kingdom.
Ms Mirga was born in Poland and, having previously lived in the UK with her parents for four years, moved back here in 2004.
The benefit rights of people from Poland in the UK were mostly governed by the Accession (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1219) (the A8 Regulations) which were enacted to give effect to the Treaty on Accession 2003 (the Accession Treaty) under which Poland (and seven other countries) joined the EU.
After finishing her education in April 2005, she carried out registered work within the meaning of the A8 Regulations for seven months.
She then became pregnant and did around three months of unregistered work.
Ms Mirga claimed income support in August 2006 under the Income Support (General) Regulations (SI 1987/1967) (the Income Support Regulations) on the grounds of pregnancy.
The Secretary of State refused Ms Mirgas application for income support and his decision was upheld by the First tier Tribunal.
The Upper Tribunal and then the Court of Appeal affirmed that decision, on the ground that Ms Mirga did not have a right of residence in the UK under the A8 Regulations and therefore was excluded from income support by the Income Support Regulations.
Mr Samin was born in Iraq in 1960.
In 1992, he and his family were granted asylum in Austria in 1992 and he was granted Austrian citizenship the following year.
He then became estranged from his wife and children and came to the UK in December 2005, since when he has lived here alone.
Where the A8 Regulations do not apply, the benefit rights of EU nationals in the UK are mostly governed by the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) (the EEA Regulations), issued pursuant to EU Directive 2004/38/EC (the 2004 Directive).
Mr Samin is socially isolated and suffers from poor mental and physical health.
Mr Samin occupied private accommodation until 2010, when he applied to Westminster City Council (the Council) for housing under the homelessness provisions of the Housing Act 1996 (the Housing Act).
The Council decided that he was a person from abroad who is not eligible for housing assistance within the meaning of section 185(1) of the Housing Act, because he did not have the right of residence in the UK under the EEA Regulations.
That decision was affirmed in the Central London County Court, whose decision was in turn upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses both Ms Mirgas and Mr Samins appeals for reasons set out in a judgment given by Lord Neuberger (with which Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke and Lord Reed agree).
Submissions of the parties The Secretary of State contended that the Court of Appeals decisions were right.
At the time she applied for it, Ms Mirga was ineligible for income support because she was a person from abroad, and could not claim to be a worker as she was an A8 national who had not done 12 months employment and thus could not qualify under the A8 Regulations.
Even if the A8 Regulations did not apply, the Secretary of State argued, Ms Mirga would not have been a worker under the EEA Regulations as she had not worked for 12 months before claiming income support [36].
In respect of Mr Samin, the Council contended that he was not a worker within the EEA Regulations because he is now incapable of work and had not worked for 12 months in the UK [37].
In response to these contentions, two arguments were raised on behalf of Ms Mirga and Mr Samin.
The first argument rested on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the TFEU).
Ms Mirga contended that, given her right to respect for family and private life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and given that she had been a worker, albeit not for the requisite period under the A8 Regulations (or the EEA Regulations), she could not be removed from the UK; accordingly, she contended, her right of residence under article 21.1 of TFEU could not lawfully be cut back by restricting her right to income support as the Income Support Regulations purport to do [38, 41].
Mr Samin argued that refusal of housing assistance to him constituted unlawful discrimination contrary to article 18.1 of the TFEU because such assistance would have been accorded to a citizen of the UK or a qualifying member from another member state who was in the same position as Mr Samin [39, 42].
Ms Mirgas alternative argument was that, even if the Income Support Regulations could have the effect for which the Secretary of State contended, it would only be so if it could be shown that providing her with income support would be disproportionate i.e. if it would place an unreasonable burden on the UK social assistance system, and there has been no inquiry into that question [38, 58].
To much the same effect, Mr Samins alternative argument was that the refusal of housing allowance to him could only be justified if it could be shown that the grant of such an allowance would be disproportionate and there had been no inquiry into that question [58].
The first issue: do the domestic Regulations infringe the appellants TFEU rights? The right accorded to Ms Mirga by article 21.1 of TFEU is qualified by the words subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the Treaties and by the measures adopted to give them effect.
In the present case, the measures include the Accession Treaty and the 2004 Directive, and hence the A8 Regulations and the EEA Regulations respectively [43].
A significant aim of these measures was to ensure that EU nationals from one member state should not be able to exercise their rights of residence in another member state so as to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system.
Further, any right of residence after three months can be subject to conditions, and EU nationals can be refused social assistance where appropriate [44].
Whether the Accession Treaty or the 2004 Directive applied, Ms Mirga has not done 12 months work in the UK, and therefore cannot claim to be a worker, and she is not a jobseeker, self employed, a student or self sufficient.
Therefore she can be validly denied a right of residence in the UK and can be excluded from social assistance.
Article 21.1 of TFEU therefore cannot assist her [45].
The article 18 right claimed by Mr Samin is limited to the scope of the Treaties, which means that it only comes into play where there is discrimination in connection with a right in the TFEU or another EU treaty.
Further, the right is without prejudice to any special provisions contained in the Treaties.
Therefore, Mr Samins argument fails for the same reasons that Ms Mirgas does [47].
Examination of recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), especially Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig [2015] All ER (EC) 1 and Case C 67/14 Jobcenter Berlin Neukolin v Alimanovic clearly support this conclusion. [48 57] The second issue: the arguments based on lack of proportionality The argument that the determinations of the courts and tribunals below in relation to Ms Mirgas claim and Mr Samins claim were flawed because no consideration was given to the proportionality of refusing each of them social assistance is rejected.
The judgments of the CJEU relied on by the appellants do not support the argument [58 66].
On the other hand, the judgment and reasoning in Dano, supported by the judgment in Alimanovic undermine the argument [66, 67, 71].
It is unrealistic to require an individual examination of each particular case, as is recognised by the jurisprudence from the CJEU [68].
Where a national of another member state is not a worker, self employed or a student and had no, or very limited, means of support and no medical insurance, it would undermine the whole thrust of the 2004 Directive if proportionality could be invoked to entitle that person to have the right of residence and social assistance in another member state, save perhaps in extreme circumstances [69].
It would also place a substantial burden on a host member state if it had to carry out a proportionality exercise in every case where the right or residence or the right against discrimination was invoked [69].
Even if there is a category of exceptional cases where proportionality would come into play, Mr Samin and Ms Mirga do not fall into it [70].
"
uksc-2012-0124,"This is an appeal brought by Mohammed Gul against a decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) dismissing an appeal against his conviction for dissemination of terrorist publications contrary to section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006 (the 2006 Act), for which he was sentenced to a term of five years imprisonment (a sentence against which he also unsuccessfully appealed).
The appeal raises the issue of the meaning of terrorism in section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (the 2000 Act).
The factual and procedural background
The appellant was born in Libya in February 1988, but he has lived much of his life in this country and he is a British citizen.
In February 2009, as a result of executing a search warrant at his house, police officers found videos on his computer uploaded onto various websites, including the YouTube website.
These videos included ones that showed (i) attacks by members of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other proscribed groups on military targets in Chechnya, and on the Coalition forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan, (ii) the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against Coalition forces, (iii) excerpts from martyrdom videos, and (iv) clips of attacks on civilians, including the 9/11 attack on New York.
These videos were accompanied by commentaries praising the bravery, and martyrdom, of those carrying out the attacks, and encouraging others to emulate them.
The case for the prosecution was that each of these videos constituted a terrorist publication within section 2(3), which the appellant had distribute[d] or circulate[d] within section 2(2)(a), and consequently he had committed an offence by virtue of section 2(1), of the 2006 Act.
The appellants principal defence was that, although he did not agree with the targeting of and attacks on civilians, he believed that the use of force shown in the other videos was justified as it was being employed in self defence by people resisting the invasion of their country.
At his first trial, the jury acquitted the appellant on four counts and was unable to agree on two other counts.
A retrial in relation to those two counts (plus a further four counts added by the Crown by way of a voluntary bill) took place in front of HH Judge Paget QC with a jury at the Central Criminal Court.
After the evidence, speeches and summing up, the jury retired to consider their verdict in the normal way on 22 February 2011.
They then asked the judge for guidance on certain questions relating to the meaning of terrorism, which, after hearing submissions from counsel, he answered.
One of the jurys questions was: Re: definition of terrorism in [section 1 of the 2000 Act], would the use of force by Coalition forces be classed as terrorism? In relation to that question, the judge gave the following direction: the use of force by Coalition forces is not terrorism.
They do enjoy combat immunity, they are ordered there by our government and the American government, unless they commit crimes such as torture or war crimes .
Later the same day, the jury asked a further question, which was in these terms: Please confirm that within Iraq/Afghanistan now there are governments in place there cannot now be said to be a conflict and therefore no combatant exemption from what would otherwise be a terrorist attack, ie IED on Coalition Forces.
To simplify, would an IED attack (ignoring self defence) on Coalition Forces be a terrorist attack if carried out in 2008/9? The judge answered this question, after hearing submissions from counsel, in these terms: I have to apply the Terrorism Act and the definition of terrorism which is part of English law, and the answer is yes, it would.
But it is ultimately for you to say.
The jury then proceeded to convict the appellant on five of the six counts.
The count on which he was acquitted related to a video which contained footage concerning the Israeli Palestinian conflict in Gaza.
The judge directed the jury that, if Israel was involved in an incursion into Gaza which involved attacks on civilians, schools, hospitals and ambulances, and all that the appellant was encouraging was resistance to these attacks, the prosecution did not seek a conviction.
The present appeal proceeded without considering whether, as a matter of law, the stance adopted by the prosecution was correct, and we do not propose to address it further.
The judge sentenced the appellant to five years imprisonment, with appropriate allowance for time spent on remand.
The appellant sought to appeal against his conviction on a number of grounds, only one of which is relevant for present purposes.
That ground, which was expressed in various ways during the course of his appeal, is ultimately embodied in the question which the Court of Appeal certified to be a point of general public importance, namely: Does the definition of terrorism in section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000 operate so as to include within its scope any or all military attacks by a non state armed group against any or all state or inter governmental organisation armed forces in the context of a non international armed conflict?
The Court of Appeal (Sir John Thomas P, Silber and Kenneth Parker JJ) answered that question in the affirmative, and also rejected certain other grounds of appeal, as well as refusing to interfere with the sentence which the judge had imposed.
Accordingly, the appellants appeal was dismissed [2012] EWCA Crim 280, [2012] 1 WLR 3432.
The appellant now appeals to this court contending that the answer to the certified question should be in the negative.
The Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006
The 2000 Act
Section 1 of the 2000 Act is headed Terrorism: Interpretation, and, as amended by the 2006 Act and the Counter Terrorism Act 2008, it provides as follows: (1) In this Act terrorism means the use or threat of action where (a) the action falls within subsection (2), (b) the use or threat is designed to influence the international governmental government or an organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and (c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause. (2) Action falls within this subsection if it (a) involves serious violence against a person, (b) involves serious damage to property, (c) endangers a persons life, other than that of the person committing the action, (d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or (e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system. (4) In this section (a) action includes action outside the United Kingdom, (b) a reference to any person or to property is a reference to any person, or to property, wherever situated, (c) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other than the United Kingdom, and (d) the government means the government of the United Kingdom, of a part of the United Kingdom or of a country other than the United Kingdom. (5) In this Act a reference to action taken for the purposes of terrorism includes a reference to action taken for the benefit of a proscribed organisation.
Part II of the 2000 Act is concerned with proscribed organisations and Part III with terrorist property.
Part III creates certain offences, such as (in sections 15 18) terrorist fundraising, using money and money laundering for terrorist purposes.
It also imposes certain duties, such as a duty of disclosure in some circumstances, a duty not to tip off, and a duty to cooperate with the police and certain government agencies, such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
It also granted certain powers to the police and such agencies, such as the right to detain, seize, and forfeit terrorist cash.
Parts IV and V of the 2000 Act are respectively concerned with terrorist investigations and counter terrorist powers.
Part V confers powers to stop and search (sections 44 47), to search individuals and premises (sections 42 43), and to arrest without warrant (section 41), and section 53 and Schedule 7 grant very wide powers to detain, interrogate, and confiscate in relation to people at ports and borders.
Part VI of the 2000 Act is entitled Miscellaneous, and it creates a number of offences related to terrorism including weapons training in connection with terrorism (section 54), directing terrorist organisations (section 56), possession for terrorist purposes (section 57), collecting information for such purposes (section 58), and inciting terrorism abroad (section 59).
Included in Part VI are sections 62 64.
Section 62(1) provides that: If (a) a person does anything outside the United Kingdom as an act of terrorism or for the purposes of terrorism, and (b) his action would have constituted the commission of one of the offences listed in subsection (2) if it had been done in the United Kingdom, he shall be guilty of the offence.
Subsection (2) states that the offences referred to in subsection (1) are offences under the Explosive Substances Act 1883, the Biological Weapons Act 1974, and the Chemical Weapons Act 1996.
Section 63 of the 2000 Act renders it an offence for a person to conduct an activity outside the UK which would be an offence under sections 15 18 if carried out in the UK.
Section 64 makes amendments to the Extradition Act 1989.
Also in Part VI of the 2000 Act are sections 63A 63E, which were inserted by the Crime (International Co operation) Act 2003 (the 2003 Act).
Section 63A provides that a UK national or UK resident commits an offence if he carries out abroad any activity which, if carried out in the UK would be an offence under, inter alia, sections 54 59.
Sections 63B 63D, in very summary terms, provide that a person commits an offence when he carries out abroad certain specified actions which, if carried out in the UK, would amount to terrorism.
Part VII of the 2000 Act is concerned with Northern Ireland.
Part VIII is entitled General, and it includes, in sections 114 116, certain police powers in connection with counter terrorism, including the power to stop and search.
Also in Part VIII is section 117, which, according to subsection (1), applies to almost all offences created by the 2000 Act; those offences to which it does not apply have no relevance for present purposes.
Subsections (2) and (2A) of section 117 (the latter subsection having been added by the 2006 Act) are in these terms: (2) Proceedings for an offence to which this section applies (a) shall not be instituted in England and Wales without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and (b) shall not be instituted in Northern Ireland without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. (2A) But if it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland that an offence to which this section applies has been committed outside the United Kingdom or for a purpose wholly or partly connected with the affairs of a country other than the United Kingdom, his consent for the purposes of this section may be given only with the permission (a) in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions, of the Attorney General; and (b) in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, of the Advocate General for Northern Ireland.
The 2006 Act
The 2006 Act made some amendments to the 2000 Act, including the addition of or an international governmental organisation (an IGO) into section 1(1)(b).
Part 1 of the 2006 Act creates certain further offences in relation to terrorism; in particular, sections 1 and 2 respectively created the new offences of Encouragement of terrorism and Dissemination of terrorist publications.
Section 2 of the 2006 Act is in these terms: (1) A person commits an offence if he engages in conduct falling within subsection (2) and, at the time he does so (a) he intends an effect of his conduct to be a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism; . or (c) he is reckless as to whether his conduct has an effect mentioned in paragraph (a) . (2) For the purposes of this section a person engages in conduct falling within this subsection if he (a) distributes or circulates a terrorist publication; . (e) transmits the contents of such a publication electronically; . (3) For the purposes of this section a publication is a terrorist publication, in relation to conduct falling within subsection (2), if matter contained in it is likely (a) to be understood, by some or all of the persons to whom it is or may become available as a consequence of that conduct, as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to them to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism; . (4) For the purposes of this section matter that is likely to be understood by a person as indirectly encouraging the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism includes any matter which (a) glorifies the commission or preparation (whether in the past, in the future or generally) of such acts; . [Subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8) amplify the preceding subsections; subsections (9) and (10) identify certain defences]. (11) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable (a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to a fine, or to both; (13) In this section . publication means an article or record of any description that contains any of the following, or any combination of them (a) matter to be read; (b) matter to be listened to; (c) matter to be looked at or watched.
Part 2 of the 2006 Act contains certain miscellaneous provisions, including the extension and modification of some of the powers granted by the 2000 Act, such as in relation to proscription, searches and investigations.
Part 3 of the 2006 Act includes some supplementary provisions of which section 36 is significant for present purposes.
That section is headed Review of terrorism legislation, and it provides as follows: (1) The Secretary of State must appoint a person to review the operation of the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 and of Part 1 of this Act. (2) That person may, from time to time, carry out a review of those provisions and, where he does so, must send a report on the outcome of his review to the Secretary of State . (3) . (4) That person must carry out and report on a review under this section at least once in every twelve month period . (5) On receiving a report under this section, the Secretary of State must lay a copy of it before Parliament.
An outline of the issues
Although the appellant was convicted of offences contrary to section 2 of the 2006 Act, the issue which has to be addressed involves the interpretation of section 1 of the 2000 Act, and, in particular, the meaning of the word terrorism.
Terrorism is, of course, central to the offences in issue.
In finding him guilty on the five counts, the jury must have been satisfied that the videos which the appellant uploaded satisfied the requirements of section 2(3)(a) of the 2006 Act.
Thus, the jury must have concluded that the videos would have been understood by others to be encouraging or inducing them to commit, prepare or instigate acts of terrorism, and that the appellant had intended, or had been reckless as to, that consequence.
The point which the Court of Appeal certified may be thought to be somewhat peripheral to the issues which confronted the jury.
However the jury asked a question which gives rise to the point, and in this particular case it would be inappropriate to disregard it as irrelevant to the eventual verdict.
If some or all of the activities shown in the uploaded videos, whose contents are briefly described in paras 2(i) to (iv) above, did not involve terrorism within the meaning of section 1 of the 2000 Act, it is possible that the appellant may have been acquitted on some or all of the five counts on which he was convicted.
The case for the prosecution is that the definition of terrorism in section 1 of the 2000 Act, and, in particular, in subsections (1) and (2), is very wide indeed, and that it would be wrong for any court to cut it down by implying some sort of restriction into the wide words used by the legislature.
On that basis, the appellant was rightly convicted and the answer to the certified question must be yes.
The case for the appellant, as it developed in oral argument, had three strands.
The first is that the 2000 Act, like the 2006 Act, was intended, at least in part, to give effect to the UKs international treaty obligations, and the concept of terrorism in international law does not extend to military attacks by a non state armed group against state, or inter governmental organisation, armed forces in the context of a non international armed conflict, and that this limitation should be implied into the definition in section 1 of the 2000 Act.
The second, and closely connected, argument is that it would be wrong to read the 2000 or 2006 Acts as criminalising in this country an act abroad, unless that act would be regarded as criminal by international law norms.
The third argument raised by the appellant is that, as a matter of domestic law and quite apart from international law considerations, some qualifications must be read into the very wide words of section 1 of the 2000 Act.
Although it was advanced as an alternative argument to the contentions based on international law, we propose to start by addressing the appellants case based on the relevant statutory provisions by reference to the familiar domestic principles, and then to consider whether that meaning conflicts with international law.
The appellants argument based on domestic law
The definition of terrorism in section 1 of the 2000 Act is, at any rate on the face of it, very wide.
That point was well made in R v F [2007] QB 960, paras 27 28: What is striking about the language of section 1, read as a whole, is its breadth.
It does not specify that the ambit of its protection is limited to countries abroad with governments of any particular type or possessed of what we, with our fortunate traditions, would regard as the desirable characteristics of representative government.
There is no list or Schedule or statutory instrument which identifies the countries whose governments are included in section 1(4)(d) or excluded from the application of the 2000 Act.
Finally, the legislation does not exempt, nor make an exception, nor create a defence for, nor exculpate what some would describe as terrorism in a just cause.
Such a concept is foreign to the 2000 Act.
Terrorism is terrorism, whatever the motives of the perpetrators.
Terrorist action outside the United Kingdom which involves the use of firearms or explosives, resulting in danger to life or creating a serious risk to the health or safety to the public in that country, or involving (not producing) serious personal violence or damage to property, or designed seriously to interfere with an electronic system, is terrorism Following these observations, the Court of Appeal in this case underlined the comprehensive scope and broad nature of the definition of terrorism in the 2000 Act: [2012] EWCA Crim 280, [2012] 1 WLR 3432, paras 16 and 52.
The effect of section 1(1) of the 2000 Act is to identify terrorism as consisting of three components.
The first is the use or threat of action, inside or outside the UK, where that action consists of, inter alia, serious violence, serious damage to property, or creating a serious risk to public safety or health section 1(1)(a), (2) and (4).
The second component is that the use or threat must be designed to influence the government [of the UK or any other country] or an [IGO] or to intimidate the public section 1(1)(b) and (4).
The third component is that the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause section 1(1)(c).
As a matter of ordinary language, the definition would seem to cover any violence or damage to property if it is carried out with a view to influencing a government or IGO in order to advance a very wide range of causes.
Thus, it would appear to extend to military or quasi military activity aimed at bringing down a foreign government, even where that activity is approved (officially or unofficially) by the UK government.
It is neither necessary nor appropriate to express any concluded view whether the definition of terrorism goes that far, although it is not entirely easy to see why, at least in the absence of international law considerations, it does not.
For present purposes it is enough to proceed on the basis that, subject to these considerations, the definition of terrorism in section 1 in the 2000 Act is, at least if read in its natural sense, very far reaching indeed.
Thus, on occasions, activities which might command a measure of public understanding, if not support, may fall within it: for example, activities by the victims of oppression abroad, which might command a measure of public understanding, and even support in this country, may well fall within it.
The Crown argues that, particularly given the purpose of the 2000 Act, terrorism cannot be narrowly defined, if one is to allow for the many disparate forms which terrorism may take, and the inevitable changes which will occur in international relations, in political regimes in other countries, and in the UKs foreign policy.
Accordingly, runs the argument, a very wide definition was deliberately adopted, but, recognising the risks of criminalising activities which should not be prosecuted, the 2000 Act has, through section 117, precluded any prosecution without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) or, if the activities under consideration occurred abroad, the Attorney General.
It is clear that it is very hard to define terrorism.
Thus, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who wrote an Inquiry into the Legislation against Terrorism (Cm 3420) which contained recommendations which were reflected in the 2000 Act, observed in a speech on the second reading of the Bill which later became that Act that there are great difficulties in finding a satisfactory definition of terrorism, and suspected that none of us will succeed.
That view has been cited with agreement in reports produced by the two successive Independent Reviewers of the legislation appointed under section 36 of the 2006 Act, Lord Carlile of Berriew QC and Mr David Anderson QC.
In reports produced in 2006 and 2007 Lord Carlile concluded that the statutory definition of terrorism was practical and effective and advised that, save for small amendments, the definition should remain as originally drafted.
More specifically, he observed that the current definition in the Terrorism Act 2000 is consistent with international comparators and treaties, and is useful and broadly fit for purpose.
Lord Carlile also stated that the discretion vested in the authorities to use or not to use the special laws is a real and significant element of protection against abuse of rights.
Mr Anderson published his first report in June 2012, in which he referred to the definition in section 1 in the 2000 Act as complex and notable for its breadth.
He pointed out that actions may amount to terrorism within the definition even when they might otherwise constitute lawful hostilities under international humanitarian law (e.g. acts of violent rebellion against oppressive governments).
Mr Anderson recognised that the statutory definition left a large discretion to prosecutors, mitigated only by the requirement [for] consent under section 117 of the 2000 Act, together with other wide discretions.
He went on to refer to the risk that strong powers could be used for purposes other than the suppression of terrorism as it is generally understood.
He also observed that there was a case for shrinking the definition of terrorism, given that [a]s presently drafted, the definition is so broad as to criminalise certain acts carried out overseas that constitute lawful hostilities under international humanitarian law.
In his recent second report, published in July 2013, Mr Anderson again
referred to the definition, describing it as remarkably broad absurdly so in some cases, and went on discuss the issue very instructively.
He pointed out that the consequence of the very broad definition was to grant unusually wide discretions to all those concerned with the application of the counter terrorism law, from Ministers exercising their power to impose executive orders to police officers deciding whom to arrest or to stop at a port and prosecutors deciding whom to charge, but went on to say that that the wide discretions appear for the most part to be responsibly exercised.
He also expressed the view that any amendment to the definition would involve a root and branch review of the entire edifice of anti terrorism law, based on a clear headed assessment of why and to what extent it is operationally necessary to supplement established criminal laws and procedures, a review which he said that he would welcome.
He also made the point that if special legal rules are to be devised in relation to it, they should be limited in their application, and justified on the basis of operational necessity.
We turn to the consent requirement created by section 117 of the 2000 Act.
In the general way the decision whether to initiate the prosecution of any crime, whether created by statute or common law, is subject to the well known prosecutorial discretion.
Where the consent of the DPP or the Attorney General is required, their respective responsibilities are exercised for the unexceptionable purpose of ensuring that a prosecution should not be instigated nor proceed if this would not be in the public interest.
However, the prosecutorial discretion was never intended, and as far as we can ascertain, it has never been suggested that it was ever intended, to assist in the interpretation of legislation which involves the creation of a criminal offence or offences.
Either specific activities carried out with a particular intention or with a particular state of mind are criminal or they are not.
The Crowns reliance on prosecutorial discretion is intrinsically unattractive, as it amounts to saying that the legislature, whose primary duty is to make the law, and to do so in public, has in effect delegated to an appointee of the executive, albeit a respected and independent lawyer, the decision whether an activity should be treated as criminal for the purposes of prosecution.
Such a statutory device, unless deployed very rarely indeed and only when there is no alternative, risks undermining the rule of law.
It involves Parliament abdicating a significant part of its legislative function to an unelected DPP, or to the Attorney General, who, though he is accountable to Parliament, does not make open, democratically accountable decisions in the same way as Parliament.
Further, such a device leaves citizens unclear as to whether or not their actions or projected actions are liable to be treated by the prosecution authorities as effectively innocent or criminal in this case seriously criminal.
Given that the consent requirement in section 117 is focused on the decision whether to consent to a prosecution, this approach to the construction of the 2000 Act has two further undesirable consequences.
First, the lawfulness of executive acts such as detention, search, interrogation and arrest could be questioned only very rarely indeed in relation to any actual or suspected involvement in actual or projected acts involving terrorism, in circumstances where there would be no conceivable prospect of such involvement being prosecuted.
Secondly, the fact that an actual or projected activity technically involves terrorism means that, as a matter of law, that activity will be criminal under the provisions of the 2000 and 2006 Acts, long before, and indeed quite irrespective of whether, any question of prosecution arises.
We return to the language used in section 1 of the 2000 Act.
Despite the undesirable consequences of the combination of the very wide definition of terrorism and the provisions of section 117, it is difficult to see how the natural, very wide, meaning of the definition can properly be cut down by this Court.
For the reasons given by Lord Lloyd, Lord Carlile and Mr Anderson, the definition of terrorism was indeed intended to be very wide.
Unless it is established that the natural meaning of the legislation conflicts with the European Convention on Human Rights (which is not suggested) or any other international obligation of the United Kingdom (which we consider in the next section of this judgment), our function is to interpret the meaning of the definition in its statutory, legal and practical context.
We agree with the wide interpretation favoured by the prosecution: it accords with the natural meaning of the words used in section 1(1)(b) of the 2000 Act, and, while it gives the words a concerningly wide meaning, there are good reasons for it.
We are reinforced in this view by the further consideration that the wide definition of terrorism was not ignored by Parliament when the 2000 Act was being debated.
It was discussed by the Home Secretary who also, in answer to a question, mentioned the filter of section 117 (see Hansard (HC Deb) 14 December 1999, cols 159, 163).
This is not a case in which it is appropriate to refer to what was said in Parliament as an aid to statutory interpretation, but it provides some comfort for the Crowns argument.
Of rather more legitimate relevance is the fact that Parliament was content to leave the definition of terrorism effectively unchanged, when considering amendments or extensions to the 2000 Act, well after the 2007 report of Lord Carlile, which so clearly (and approvingly) drew attention to the width of the definition of terrorism see eg the Crime and Security Act 2010, the Terrorist Asset Freezing etc Act 2010 and the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011.
In reaching our conclusion, we do not attach any weight to the provisions of
section 117 of the 2000 Act as an aid to construction.
It may well be that any concern which Parliament had about the width of the definition of terrorism in section 1(1) was mitigated by the existence of the statutory prosecutorial discretion, but, for the reasons given in paras 35 and 37 above, we do not regard it as an appropriate reason for giving terrorism a wide meaning.
Accordingly, we conclude that, unless the appellants argument based on international law dictates a different conclusion, the definition of terrorism as in section 1 of the 2000 Act is indeed as wide as it appears to be.
This would result in the certified question being answered yes.
The appellants argument based on international law Introductory
If the attacks on Coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and on military
targets in Chechnya, shown on the seized videos would otherwise amount to terrorism as defined in section 1 of the 2000 Act, the appellant contends that this would be contrary to, or inconsistent with, the norms of international law.
The appellant has two arguments in this connection.
The first is that some provisions of the 2000 and 2006 Acts were enacted to give effect to the UKs international obligations arising under treaties concerned with the suppression of terrorism, and that terrorism should accordingly be given a meaning in those statutes which accords with the international law norm, and at any rate with the definition in the relevant international document to which effect is intended to be given.
The second argument is that, as the 2000 and 2006 Acts criminalise certain terrorist actions committed outside the UK, the meaning of terrorism in those statutes should not be wider than what is accepted as an international norm.
No international consensus as to terrorism
These two arguments each face more than one insuperable obstacle.
The common obstacle they both face is that there is no accepted norm in international law as to what constitutes terrorism.
As this court observed in a judgment given by Lady Hale and Lord Dyson in Al Sirri v Secretary of State for the Home Department (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees intervening) [2013] 1 AC 745, para 37, there is as yet no internationally agreed definition of terrorism and no comprehensive international Convention binding Member States to take action against it.
Indeed, the reasoning in that case proceeded on the basis that the definition of terrorism in the 2000 Act was significantly wider than in article 1F(c) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (the Geneva Convention) see para 36.
The appellant seeks to meet this point through the contention that, whereas there is no international agreement as to the meaning of terrorism, there is a general understanding that it does not extend to the acts of insurgents or freedom fighters in non international armed conflicts.
The short answer to this point is that, while there is significant support for such an idea, any such support falls far short of amounting to a general understanding which could be properly invoked as an aid to statutory interpretation.
As the Court of Appeal said in para 35, while international law has developed so that the crime of terrorism is recognised in situations where there is no armed conflict, it has not developed so that it could be said there is sufficient certainty that such a crime could be defined as applicable during a state of armed conflict.
Accordingly, as it went on to conclude in para 50, there is no rule of international law which requires this court to read down section 1 of the 2000 Act.
The United Nations has attempted to identify a comprehensive definition of terrorism, but has so far failed.
Indeed, it appears that one of the difficulties has been achieving agreement as to the very point at issue in this appeal.
In 2007, the ad hoc committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 suggested that it be agreed that the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention.
However no consensus has been achieved, because various states delegations were concerned about (a) the right of peoples to self determination under international law; (b) the activities of armed forces in armed conflict; and (c) the activities of military forces of a State in peacetime, also taking into account related concerns about State terrorism to quote from the committees 2011 report.
In early 2012, the General Assembly established a working group to finalise the drafting of a comprehensive international convention on terrorism, but, by the end of that year, the chair of the group reported that there were still disagreements, including as to the precise distinction between terrorism and legitimate struggle of peoples fighting in the exercise of their right to self determination.
It is true that there are UN Conventions and Council of Europe Conventions concerned with counter terrorism, which define terrorism as excluding activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, but there is room for argument as to their precise effect, and, more importantly, it is quite impossible to suggest that there is a plain or consistent approach in UN Conventions on this issue.
Thus, the Crown asserts that the UN has adopted fourteen counter terrorism treaties to date1, and of these fourteen treaties (i) seven state that the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law are not governed 1 1963 Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft; 1970 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; 2010 Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation; 1973 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons; 1979 International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material; 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation; 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation; 2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation; 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf; 2005 Protocol to the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf; 1991 Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection; 1997 International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings; 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; 2005 International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism; 2010 Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation; http://www.un.org/terrorism/instruments.shtml by this Convention, (ii) of the seven which have no such statement, six provide that the treaty does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with national law, and (iii) of the seven which include such a statement, at least five contain a provision substantially to the like effect.
The appellant contends that the absence of an armed conflict exclusion from a treaty does not mean that that treaty applies in relation to an action at a time of armed conflict.
However, it is not normally appropriate to imply a term into an international treaty, and, in any event, the absence of any such express exclusion is scarcely consistent with the contention that there is an internationally accepted norm such as the appellant suggests.
Further, as this court pointed out in Al Sirri, para 68, an attack on [the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan] is in principle capable of being an act contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and such an attack therefore can constitute terrorism see para 3 of the same judgment.
Consistently with this, there have been UN resolutions referring to the activities of Al Qaida and the Taliban as terrorism, notwithstanding allegations that their actions involved insurgents attacking forces of states and IGOs in non international armed conflict (eg UN Security Council resolutions 2041, 2069 and 2082 of 2012, and Council Decision 2011/486/CFSP of 1 August 2011).
In addition, in international humanitarian law, it appears that insurgents in non international armed conflicts do not enjoy combatant immunity.
Crawford in the Treatment of Combatants and Insurgents under the Law of Armed Conflict (2010), pp 78 79, says that international law does not immunize participation in non international armed conflict, and that there is nothing in the customary international law that replicates combatant immunity for persons who participate in non international armed conflicts, a view supported by Sivakumaran in The Law of Non International Armed Conflicts (2012), p 515.
As for domestic legislation across the world, the Crown states in its argument, without challenge, that of a survey of 42 states it has identified with legislation which defines terrorism, (i) 28 do not exclude armed attacks, (ii) four explicitly include armed attacks, and (iii) seven explicitly exclude armed attacks (which includes the United States, although its position might be said to be ambivalent, as some of the relevant legislation is widely drawn without the exclusion).
It is true that none of these legislative provisions explicitly refer to armed attacks during a time of armed conflict, but we would refer back to the point made at the end of para 48 above.
Other problems faced by the appellants case
It appears clear that sections 62 64 of the 2000 Act give effect to the UKs obligations under the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings 1997 and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism 1999.
It is also fair to say that these two Conventions, particularly the latter, appear to have been drafted so as to exclude insurgent attacks on military forces in non international armed conflicts from their respective ambits.
However, the notion that the meaning of terrorism in section 1 of the 2000 Act should be read down, because some of the activities which were rendered offences by that Act were criminalised as a result of the UKs obligations under the two Conventions, runs into two difficulties.
First, there is no rule that the UK government cannot go further than is required by an international treaty when it comes to legislating the exercise is often known as gold plating.
It is not as if there is anything in either the 1997 or the 1999 Convention which excludes a signatory state going further than the requirements of the Convention, or anything in the 2000 Act which suggests that Parliament intended to go no further.
That is not to say that gold plating is never objectionable, but no argument was advanced on this appeal to suggest that there was any reason why it was objectionable in this case (save that considered and rejected in paras 44 51 above).
Secondly, quite apart from this, if the wide definition of terrorism in section 1 of the 2000 Act has to be read down for the purposes of sections 62 64, there is no reason to read it down when it comes to any other provision of the Act or of the 2006 Act.
In Al Sirri, para 36, this court appears to have approved, indeed to have relied on, the proposition that, if application of the wide definition of terrorism in section 1 of the 2000 Act led to another provision of the Act conflicting with the UKs obligations under the Geneva Convention, then the definition should be read down when applied to the provision in question, and not generally throughout the Act.
To conclude otherwise would be a classic case of letting the tail wag the dog.
The 2006 Act takes the appellants argument no further.
It is true that some of its provisions give effect to the UKs obligations under the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism 2005 and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism 2005.
However, section 2 of the 2006 Act was not enacted to give effect to any international Convention, and, even if it had been and had gone further than the Convention concerned required, there is no reason why Parliament should not have gold plated the legislation, as already explained.
The appellants reliance on the fact that there are provisions of the 2000 and 2006 Acts which criminalise various activities as terrorist offences even if committed abroad, runs into similar problems.
Even if it were the case that, because of the need to take into account the UKs international law obligations, the wide definition of terrorism had to be read down when it comes to construing those provisions, that would be of no assistance to a defendant such as the appellant, who is a UK citizen being prosecuted for offences allegedly committed in this country.
There is no reason to read down the wide definition of terrorism in a case such as this.
The present case does not involve a defendant who has committed acts, which are said to be offences, abroad: the activities said to be offences were committed in the UK and by a UK citizen.
That renders it unnecessary for us to consider whether, as there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism, the Court of Appeal was right to decide that there is no reason why Parliament cannot criminalise acts of terrorism, as defined in section 1 of the 2000 Act, committed outside the UK.
In reaching that decision, the Court of Appeal relied on the Permanent Court of International Justices statement in The SS Lotus 1927, PCIJ, Series A, No 10, para 48 that [r]estrictions upon the independence of states cannot be presumed given that the rules of law binding upon states emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usages generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between [states] or with a view to the achievement of common aims.
Whilst various assumptions on which that decision was based have been modified or superseded by subsequent developments in international law, the Lotus principle [is] that states have the right to do whatever is not prohibited by international law, as is stated in the Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law, in its discussion of the case.
The appellant contends that the mere fact that certain actions can be characterised as terrorism without offending international law does not mean that those actions can be criminalised by one state if they are carried out in another state.
The appellant cites, for example, Brownlies Principles of Public International Law (8th ed 2012), p 458, which says if a state wishes to project its prescriptive jurisdiction extra territorially, it must find a recognised basis in international law for doing so.
That raises a point of some importance and some difficulty, and it might be said to represent a shift in focus in international law.
Given that we do not have to decide the issue, we should not do so in this appeal: it should await another case.
Conclusion
We would accordingly answer the certified question yes, and consequently we would dismiss this appeal.
Before ending this judgment, we would make two further points of a general nature about the 2000 and 2006 Acts.
First, we revert to the concern about the width of the definition of terrorism, as discussed in paras 28 29 and 33 37 above.
In his first report, Mr Anderson QC made the point that the current law allows members of any nationalist or separatist group to be turned into terrorists by virtue of their participation in a lawful armed conflict, however great the provocation and however odious the regime which they have attacked.
He went on to say that other definitions of terrorism choose to exclude activities sanctioned by international law from the reach of terrorist activity, citing the Canadian and South African Criminal Codes as examples.
In his second report, Mr Anderson mentioned the potential application of the Terrorism Acts even to UK forces engaged in conflicts overseas, and referred to the fact that a recent Australian report recommend[ed] that Australian law be changed so as to provide that the relevant parts of the Criminal Code, as in Canada, do not apply to acts committed by parties regulated by the law of armed conflict.
While acknowledging that the issue is ultimately one for Parliament, we should record our view that the concerns and suggestions about the width of the statutory definition of terrorism which Mr Anderson has identified in his two reports merit serious consideration.
Any legislative narrowing of the definition of terrorism, with its concomitant reduction in the need for the exercise of discretion under section 117 of the 2000 Act, is to be welcomed, provided that it is consistent with the public protection to which the legislation is directed.
The second general point is that the wide definition of terrorism does not only give rise to concerns in relation to the very broad prosecutorial discretion bestowed by the 2000 and 2006 Acts, as discussed in paras 36 37 above.
The two Acts also grant substantial intrusive powers to the police and to immigration officers, including stop and search, which depend upon what appears to be a very broad discretion on their part.
While the need to bestow wide, even intrusive, powers on the police and other officers in connection with terrorism is understandable, the fact that the powers are so unrestricted and the definition of terrorism is so wide means that such powers are probably of even more concern than the prosecutorial powers to which the Acts give rise.
detain in port and at borders is left to the examining officer.
The power is not subject to any controls.
Indeed, the officer is not even required to have grounds for suspecting that the person concerned falls within section 40(1) of the 2000 Act (ie that he has committed an offence, or he is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism), or even that any offence has been or may be committed, before commencing an examination to see whether the person falls within that subsection.
On this appeal, we are not, of course, directly concerned with that issue in this case.
But detention of the kind provided for in the Schedule represents the possibility of serious invasions of personal liberty.
Thus, under Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act, the power to stop, question and
","The issue in the appeal is whether the definition of terrorism in the Terrorism Act 2000 includes military attacks by non state armed groups against national or international armed forces in a non international armed conflict.
Mr Gul was convicted by a jury of five counts of disseminating terrorist publications, for which he was sentenced to five years imprisonment.
The offence was created by section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006, which defines terrorist publications as including publications which are likely to be understood as a direct or indirect encouragement to the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism.
Terrorism is defined in section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000, as the use or threat of action, inside or outside the United Kingdom, (a) involving serious violence against a person, involving serious damage to property, endangering another persons life, creating a serious risk to public health or safety, or designed to seriously interfere with seriously disrupt an electronic system; (b) designed to influence a government or intergovernmental organization or to intimidate the public or a section of the public; and (c) made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial, or ideological cause.
The publications in question included videos which Mr Gul posted on YouTube showing (i) attacks by members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other proscribed groups on military targets in Chechnya, and on the Coalition forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan, (ii) the use of improvised explosive devices against Coalition forces, (iii) excerpts from martyrdom videos, and (iv) clips of attacks on civilians, including the 11 September 2001 attack on the United States.
These videos were accompanied by commentaries praising the bravery, and martyrdom, of those carrying out the attacks, and encouraging others to emulate them.
The Court of Appeal refused Mr Guls appeal against conviction and sentence.
His appeal to the Supreme Court was based on a challenge to the conclusion of the Court of Appeal (arising from a direction given by the trial judge following a request from the jury) that the definition of terrorism included military attacks by non state armed groups against national or international armed forces in their territory.
The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Mr Guls appeal for reasons contained in a judgment given by Lord Neuberger and Lord Judge, with whom the other members of the Court agree.
Mr Gul argued that both domestic law and international law required the statutory definition of terrorism to be interpreted narrowly, so as to exclude its application to situations such as those depicted in some of the videos which he had uploaded, namely those involving actions by non state armed troops attacking foreign armed forces in their territory.
The court addresses this argument first by considering the application of familiar domestic law principles to the statutory definition of terrorism, and then by considering whether that results in a conclusion which has to be adapted to meet those requirements of international law that are incorporated into domestic law [25].
Applying the familiar domestic law approach to statutory interpretation, the Court holds that there is no basis on which the natural, very wide, meaning of section 1 of the 2000 Act could be read restrictively, as Mr Gul
argued.
The definition had clearly been drafted in deliberately wide terms so as to take account of the various and possibly unpredictable forms that terrorism might take, and the changes which may occur in the diplomatic and political spheres [312, 38].
In reaching this conclusion, the Court considers that section 117 of the 2000 Act, which prohibits the prosecution of most offences under the 2000 and 2006 Acts without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or (in some cases) the Attorney General, is of no assistance [35 37, 42].
The Court also observes that creating an offence with a very broad reach and then invoking prosecutorial discretion as a means of mitigation is undesirable in principle and should only be adopted if it is unavoidable.
In these circumstances, the only reason for the Court to interpret the definition more restrictively would be if it conflicted with the European Convention on Human Rights (which was not relied on by Mr Gul) or with the United Kingdoms obligations in international law more generally [38].
The first aspect of Mr Guls argument here was that the United Kingdoms international obligations require it to define terrorism more narrowly in its criminal laws, as it should have the same meaning as it has in international law.
The second aspect was that the United Kingdom could not criminalize terrorism happening abroad except so far as international law allowed.
Both aspects of the international law argument face the insuperable obstacle that there is no accepted definition of terrorism in international law [44].
The U.N. General Assemblys working group seeking to agree a comprehensive international convention on terrorism, reported in 2012 that there were disagreements as to the precise distinction between terrorism and legitimate struggle of peoples fighting in the exercise of their right to self determination.
And, although there are other, non comprehensive treaties dealing with terrorism, there is no plain or consistent approach in UN Conventions on the issue [4648].
This is consistent with what was said by this Court in Al Sirri v Secretary of State [2012] UKSC 54, [2012] 3 WLR 1263, para 37 [44].
Moreover, there have been U.N. resolutions referring to the activities of al Qaeda and the Taliban as terrorism, although their actions involved insurgents attacking forces of states and intergovernmental organizations in non international armed conflict.
And the international law of armed conflict does not give any immunity combatants in non international armed conflicts [4950].
It is true that some other provisions of the 2000 and 2006 Acts give effect to treaties that do not extend to insurgent attacks on military forces in non international armed conflicts.
But there was no reason why the United Kingdom could not go further in the 2000 Act than the treaties had.
And even if those treaties had intended to limit the definition of terrorism that they applied, that would only affect the particular provisions of the 2000 Act that implemented those treaties [54].
As to the second aspect of the international law argument, it is irrelevant for present purposes whether the United Kingdom can criminalize certain actions committed abroad, because the material in this case was disseminated in the United Kingdom [56].
Therefore, whether one approaches the matter as an issue of purely domestic law, or as an issue of domestic law read in the light of international law, there is no valid basis for reading the definition of terrorism more narrowly than the plain and natural meaning of its words suggested.
In parting, the Court notes that although the issue is one for Parliament to decide, the current definition of terrorism is concerningly wide. [38] Canada and South Africa, for example, exclude acts committed by parties regulated by the law of armed conflict from the definition, and a recent report in Australia recommends that that country should follow suit. [61] The Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation in the United Kingdom, Mr David Anderson QC, has made the point that the current law allows members of any nationalist or separatist group to be turned into terrorists by virtue of their participation in a lawful armed conflict, however great the provocation and however odious the regime which they have attacked [61].
The 2000 and 2006 Acts also grant substantial intrusive powers to the police and to immigration officers, which depend upon what appears to be a very broad discretion on their part.
While the need to bestow wide, even intrusive, powers on the police and other officers in connection with terrorism is understandable, the fact that the powers are so unrestricted and the definition of terrorism is so wide is probably of even more concern than the power of criminal prosecution to which the Acts give rise.

"
uksc-2014-0087,"Vicarious liability in tort requires, first, a relationship between the defendant and the wrongdoer, and secondly, a connection between that relationship and the wrongdoers act or default, such as to make it just that the defendant should be held legally responsible to the claimant for the consequences of the wrongdoers conduct.
In this case the wrongdoer was employed by the defendant, and so there is no issue about the first requirement.
The issue in the appeal is whether there was sufficient connection between the wrongdoers employment and his conduct towards the claimant to make the defendant legally responsible.
By contrast, the case of Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10, which was heard by the same division of the court at the same time, is concerned with the first requirement.
The judgments are separate because the claims and issues are separate, but they are intended to be complementary to each other in their legal analysis.
In preparing this judgment I have had the benefit of Lord Reeds judgment in Cox, and I agree fully with his reasoning and conclusion.
The question in this appeal concerns an employers vicarious liability in tort for an assault carried out by an employee.
It is a subject which has troubled the courts on numerous occasions and the case law is not entirely consistent.
In addressing the issues which it raises, it will be necessary to examine how the law in this area has developed, what stage it has reached and whether it is in need of significant change.
In this case the victim was a customer.
I will call him the claimant although he sadly died from an illness unrelated to his claim before his appeal was heard by this court.
The respondent company is a well known operator of a chain of supermarkets.
It has premises in Small Heath, Birmingham, which include a petrol station.
The petrol station has a kiosk with the usual display of goods and a counter where customers pay for their purchases.
One of the companys employees was Mr Amjid Khan.
His job was to see that the petrol pumps and the kiosk were kept in good running order and to serve customers.
The claimant was of Somali origin.
On the morning of 15 March 2008 he was on his way to take part with other members of his community in an event in London.
While he was at the petrol station he decided to inquire whether it would be possible to print some documents from a USB stick which he was carrying.
The trial judge, Mr Recorder Khangure QC, accepted in full the claimants account of what followed.
The claimant went into the kiosk and explained to the staff what he wanted.
There were two or three staff present.
Mr Khan, who was behind the counter, replied by saying We dont do such shit.
The claimant protested at being spoken to in that manner.
Using foul, racist and threatening language, Mr Khan ordered the claimant to leave.
The claimant walked out of the kiosk and returned to his car by the air pump.
He was followed by Mr Khan.
The claimant got into his car and switched on the engine, but before he could drive off Mr Khan opened the front passenger door and told him in threatening words never to come back.
The claimant told Mr Khan to get out of the car and shut the passenger door.
Instead, Mr Khan punched the claimant on his left temple, causing him pain and shock.
The claimant switched off the engine and got out in order to walk round and close the passenger door.
At this point Mr Khan again punched him in the head, knocked him to the floor and subjected him to a serious attack, involving punches and kicks, while the claimant lay curled up on the petrol station forecourt, trying to protect his head from the blows.
In carrying out the attack Mr Khan ignored instructions from his supervisor, who came on the scene at some stage and tried to stop Mr Khan from behaving as he did.
The judge concluded that the reasons for Mr Khans behaviour were a matter of speculation.
The claimant himself had said and done nothing which could be considered abusive or aggressive.
The trial judges decision
In a detailed and impressive judgment, the judge reviewed the principal authorities.
He expressed great sympathy for the claimant but concluded that the company was not vicariously liable for Mr Khans unprovoked assault.
His principal reason was that although Mr Khans job involved some interaction with customers and members of the public who attended the kiosk, it involved nothing more than serving and helping them.
There was not a sufficiently close connection between what he was employed to do and his tortious conduct for his employer to be held vicariously liable, applying the close connection test laid down in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22; [2001] 1 AC 215 and followed in later cases including Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48; [2003] 2 AC 366.
A further reason given by the judge was that Mr Khan made a positive decision to come out from behind the counter and follow the claimant out of the kiosk in contravention of instructions given to him.
The Court of Appeals decision
The Court of Appeal (Arden, Treacy and Christopher Clarke LJJ) upheld the judges decision that the claim against the company failed the close connection test.
The main points made in the judgments were that Mr Khans duties were circumscribed.
He was not given duties involving a clear possibility of confrontation or placed in a situation where an outbreak of violence was likely.
The fact that his employment involved interaction with customers was not enough to make his employers liable for his use of violence towards the claimant.
Christopher Clarke LJ added that if the question had been simply whether it would be fair and just for the company to be required to compensate the claimant for his injuries from the assault, there would be strong grounds for saying that it should.
The assault arose out of an interchange which began when the claimant asked to be supplied with a service which he thought the company could provide.
Mr Khan, whose job it was to deal with such a request, followed up his refusal with an apparently motiveless attack on the customer, who was in no way at fault.
The customer was entitled to expect a polite response.
Instead he was struck on the head and kicked when on the ground.
In those circumstances it could be said that the employer could fairly be expected to bear the cost of compensation, rather than that the victim should be left without any civil remedy except against an assailant who was unlikely to be able to pay full compensation.
However, he concluded that this was not the legal test, and that the fact that Mr Khans job involved interaction with the public did not provide the degree of connection between his employment and the assault which was necessary for the employer to be held vicariously liable.
Christopher Clarke LJ said that he was attracted for a time by the proposition that the assault could be looked at as a perverse execution of Mr Khans duty to engage with customers, but he considered that such an approach parted company with reality.
Grounds of appeal
In this court the claimants primary argument was that the time has come for a new test of vicarious liability.
In place of the close connection test the courts should apply a broader test of representative capacity.
In the case of a tort committed by an employee, the decisive question should be whether a reasonable observer would consider the employee to be acting in the capacity of a representative of the employer at the time of committing the tort.
A company should be liable for the acts of its human embodiment.
In the present case, Mr Khan was the companys employed representative in dealing with a customer.
What mattered was not just the closeness of the connection between his duties to his employer and his tortious conduct, but the setting which the employer had created.
The employer created the setting by putting the employee into contact and close physical proximity with the claimant.
Alternatively, it was argued that the claimant should in any event have succeeded because he was a lawful visitor to the premises and Mr Khan was acting within the field of activities assigned to him in dealing with the claimant.
Origins and development of vicarious liability
The development of the doctrine of vicarious liability can be traced to a number of factors; in part to legal theories, of which there have been several; in part to changes in the structure and size of economic and other (eg charitable) enterprises; and in part to changes in social attitudes and the courts sense of justice and fairness, particularly when faced with new problems such as cases of sexual abuse of children by people in a position of authority.
According to Holdsworths A History of English Law (1908) (vol 3, pp 383 387) in medieval times the general principle was that a master was only liable at civil law for misdeeds of his servants if done by his command and consent.
It would be against all reason, said counsel in the reign of Henry IV, to impute blame or default to a man, when he has none in him, for the carelessness of his servants cannot be said to be his act (YB 2 Hy IV Pasch pl 5).
But there were some exceptions, which today would be classed as instances of non delegable duty.
Liability for damage by fire was an example.
The law imposed on house holders a duty to keep their fires from damaging their neighbours.
If a fire was caused by a servant or guest, and it damaged a neighbours house, the owner was liable.
He could escape liability only by showing that the fire originated from the act of a stranger (YB 2 Hy IV Pasch pl 6).
The 17th century was a century of expansion of commerce and industry, and vicarious liability began to be broadened.
Holt CJ was particularly influential in this development.
In Boson v Sandford (1691) 2 Salk 440 a shipper of goods sued the ship owner for damage caused by the negligence of the master.
Eyre J held that there was no difference between a land carrier and a water carrier, and therefore the owners were under a special liability as carriers for the acts of their servants; but Holt CJ rested his judgment on the broad principle that whoever employs another is answerable for him, and undertakes for his care to all that make use of him. (The action failed on a technical pleading point.)
In Tuberville v Stamp (1698) 1 Ld Raym 264, Skinner 681, SC Comb 459, the plaintiff complained that the defendants servant lit a fire on heath land which destroyed the heath growing on the plaintiffs land.
The majority of the judges held that the plaintiff had a cause of action under the medieval rule about liability for fire; but Holt CJ doubted whether that rule applied to fires other than in houses, and he based liability (according to the report in Comb.) on the broader ground that if my servant doth anything prejudicial to another, it shall bind me, when it may be presumed that he acts by my authority, being about my business.
Holt CJ did not confine this principle to cases of negligence.
In Hern v Nichols (1700) 1 Salk 289, the plaintiff brought an action on the case for deceit, alleging that he bought several parcels of silk under a fraudulent representation by the defendants factor that it was another kind of silk.
The factor was operating overseas and there was no evidence of deceit on the part of the defendant personally.
Holt CJ held that the defendant was nevertheless liable for seeing somebody must be a loser by this deceit, it is more reason that he that employs and puts a trust and confidence in a deceiver should be a loser, than a stranger.
Holt CJ gave the same explanation for the development of the principle in Sir Robert Waylands Case (1706) 3 Salk 234, the master at his peril ought to take care what servant he employs; and it is more reasonable that he should suffer for the cheats of his servant than strangers and tradesmen.
Holt CJ also held that for the master to be liable the servants act had to be within the area of the authority given to him: Middleton v Fowler (1699) 1 Salk 282.
Holdsworth noted that the first case in which the modern principle can begin to be seen was the admiralty case of Boson v Sandford, and he considered it not unlikely that necessities arising from the demands of the commercial world, and the influence of Roman law on the admiralty courts, led to the introduction of ideas which then permeated to the common law courts (vol 8, p 476).
He also observed that this was only one of the influences and that a number of reasons were put forward to explain the basis of vicarious liability.
These he summarised as follows (at p 477): It was sometimes put on the ground that the master by implication undertakes to answer for his servants tort which is clearly not true.
Sometimes it was put on the ground that the servant had an implied authority so to act which again is clearly not true.
Sometimes it was grounded on the fiction that the wrong of the servant is the wrong of the master, from which the conclusion was drawn that the master must be liable because no man shall be allowed to make any advantage of his own wrong; and sometimes on the ground that the master who chooses a careless servant is liable for making a careless choice.
Blackstone gives all these reasons for this principle.
In addition, he deals with the totally different case where a master has actually authorised the commission of a tort; and cites most of the mediaeval cases of vicarious liability with the special reasons for each of them.
It is not surprising that he should take refuge in the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se or that others should have used in a similar way the maxim respondeat superior.
His treatment of the matter illustrates the confusion of the authorities; and it is noteworthy that he does not allude to the true reason for the rule the reason of public policy which Holt CJ, gave in Hern v Nichols and in Waylands Case.
In Barwick v English Joint Stock Bank (1867) 2 LR Exch 259, 265, Willes J described it as settled since Lord Holts time that a principal is answerable for the act of an agent in the course of his business, but it was argued in that case (despite the decision in Hern v Nichols) that a principal was not liable for a fraudulent act of his agent.
Willes J rejected that argument, holding that no sensible distinction can be drawn between the case of fraud and the case of any other wrong.
He cited authorities in which the doctrine had been applied, for example, in cases of direct trespass to goods and false imprisonment, and he observed (at p 266): In all these cases it may be said, as it was said here, that the master has not authorized the act.
It is true, he has not authorized the particular act, but he has put the agent in his place to do that class of acts, and he must be answerable for the manner in which the agent has conducted himself in doing the business which it was the act of his master to place him in.
His judgment gave rise to difficulties of a different kind because it included the following statement (at p 265): The general rule is, that the master is answerable for every such wrong of the servant or agent as is committed in the course of the service and for the masters benefit, though no express command or privity of the master be proved. (Emphasis added.)
The words in italics were used in later cases to support the argument that in order to establish vicarious liability it was necessary to show that the employees misdeed was committed for the employers benefit.
This argument was rejected by the House of Lords in the landmark case of Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co [1912] AC 716.
A solicitors clerk, who was entrusted by the defendant firm with managing its conveyancing department, defrauded the plaintiff, who had come to the firm for advice about two properties left to her by her late husband.
He advised her to sell and procured her signature on documents conveying the properties to himself, which he disposed of for his own benefit.
It was held that the firm was liable for his fraud.
Lord Macnaghten, who gave the leading judgment (with which Lord Loreburn LC and Lord Atkinson agreed) and Lord Halsbury both referred with approval to the general principle enunciated by Lord Holt (pp 726 727 and 732).
Lord Macnaghten, at pp 735 736, also endorsed Lord Blackburns interpretation of Barwicks case in Houldsworth v City of Glasgow Bank (1880) 5 App Cas 317, 339, namely that the substantial point decided in that case was that an innocent principal was civilly responsible for the fraud of his authorised agent, acting within his authority, to the same extent as if it was his own fraud.
Lord Macnaghten recognised the difficulty of trying to give a precise meaning to the expression within his authority.
He referred at pp 732 734 to the discussion of the subject by Sir Montague Smith in Mackay v Commercial Bank of New Brunswick (1874) LR 5 PC 394, 410, who observed that since it may be generally assumed that, in mercantile transactions, principals do not authorise their agents to act fraudulently, frauds are beyond the agents authority in the narrowest sense of which the expression admits; but that so narrow a sense would be opposed to justice and so a wider construction had been put on the words, and that it was difficult to define how far it went.
Lord Macnaghten (at p 736) agreed that what is meant by the expressions acting within his authority, acting in the course of his employment and acting within the scope of his agency (as applied to an agent) is not easy to define, but he said that whichever expression is used, it must be construed liberally.
Lord Macnaghten noted that it was within the scope of the clerks employment to advise clients regarding the best way to sell property and the execution of any necessary documents.
He concluded that the clerk was therefore acting within the scope of his employment.
Lord Macnaghten also made the broader point that it would be unjust if the firm were not held liable.
The clerk was its accredited representative: p 738.
It was right that the loss from his fraud should be suffered by the person who placed him in that position rather than the client who dealt with him as the firms representative.
Although taking properties from the plaintiff was far removed from what the wrongdoer was employed to do, the justice of the decision is obvious.
The wrongdoer was trusted both by his firm and by its client.
They were each innocent, but one of them had to bear the loss, and it was right that it should be the employer on the principle stated by Lord Holt in Hern v Nichols.
The firm employed the wrongdoer and placed him in a position to deal with the claimant; he abused that position and took advantage of her.
It was fairer that the firm should suffer for the cheating by their employee than the client who was cheated.
In 1907 Salmond published the first edition of his text book on the Law of Torts.
He defined a wrongful act by a servant in the course of his employment as either (a) a wrongful act authorised by the master or (b) a wrongful and unauthorised mode of doing some act authorised by the master, with the amplification that a master is liable for acts which he has not authorised if they are so connected with acts which he has authorised, that they may rightly be regarded as modes although improper modes of doing them (pp 83 84).
Salmonds formula, repeated in later editions, was cited and applied in many cases, sometimes by stretching it artificially; but even with stretching, it was not universally satisfactory.
The difficulties in its application were particularly evident in cases of injury to persons or property caused by an employees deliberate act of misconduct.
In Petterson v Royal Oak Hotel Ltd [1948] NZLR 136 a barman refused to serve a drunken customer with more alcohol.
As the customer was on his way out of the premises, he threw a glass at the barman which broke in pieces at his feet.
The barman picked up a piece of the broken glass and threw it back at the departing customer, but missed him and injured the eye of another customer, who sued for damages.
The trial judge found that the barman threw the piece of glass not in order to expedite the departure of the troublesome customer, but as an expression of his personal resentment at the glass being thrown at him.
He found for the claimant and his judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The Salmond formula was cited in argument.
The Court of Appeal held that the barmans act was an improper mode of doing his job of keeping order in the bar and avoiding altercations, although at the time the customer was leaving.
The justice of the result is obvious.
The claimant was struck in the eye by a piece of glass thrown by the barman who was on duty, and there would be something wrong with the law if he was not entitled to compensation from the company which employed the barman.
A barman needs to be capable of acting with restraint under provocation, for the safety of other customers, and if the proprietor engaged someone who was incapable of doing so and who injured an innocent customer, it would be wrong for the customer to be left with his only remedy against the barman.
But to rationalise the result by describing the barmans loss of temper and act of retaliation as a mode, but improper mode, of keeping order and avoiding altercation is an unnatural use of words.
Deatons Pty Ltd v Flew (1949) 79 CLR 370 had similarities to Petterson but was decided differently.
According to the jurys verdict, the claimant was the victim of an unprovoked attack by a barmaid on duty in a hotel when he asked her for the manager.
She threw a glass of beer over him and then threw the glass in his face, causing him the loss of sight in one eye.
The High Court of Australia held that there was no basis for finding that the barmaid was acting in the course of her employment.
They rejected the argument that her conduct was incidental to her employment in that it was a method, though an improper method, of responding to an inquiry from a customer.
They also rejected the argument, which had succeeded in Petterson, that her conduct was an improper mode of keeping order.
Dixon J gave two reasons: first, that she did not throw the glass in the course of keeping discipline, and secondly, that she was not in charge of the bar, but was working under the supervision of another woman.
I agree that it was tortuous and artificial to describe the barmaids conduct as a mode of performing what she was employed to do, but that does not make the result just.
In a broader sense it occurred in the course of her employment.
She was employed by the hotel proprietor to serve customers.
She was approached in that capacity by a customer, and ordinary members of the public would surely expect the company who employed her to serve customers to have some responsibility for her conduct towards them.
And it surely cannot be right that the measure of the companys responsibility should depend on whether she was the head barmaid or an assistant.
The customer would have no knowledge what were the exact limits of her responsibilities.
In Warren v Henlys Ltd [1948] 2 All ER 935 a customer at a petrol station had an angry confrontation with the petrol station attendant, who wrongly suspected him of trying to make off without payment.
The customer became enraged at the manner in which he was spoken to by the attendant.
After paying for the petrol, the customer saw a passing police car and drove off after it.
He complained to the police officer about the attendants conduct and persuaded the officer to return with him to the petrol station.
The officer listened to both men and indicated that he did not think that it was a police matter, whereupon the customer said that he would report the attendant to his employer.
The officer was on the point of leaving, when the attendant punched the customer in the face, knocking him to the ground.
Hilbery J held that the assault was not committed in the course of the attendants employment, applying the Salmond formula.
By the time that the assault happened the customers business with the petrol station had ended, the petrol had been paid for and the customer had left the premises.
When he returned with the police officer it was for the purpose of making a personal complaint about the attendant.
The attendant reacted violently to being told that the customer was going to report him to his employer, but there was no basis for holding the employer vicariously liable for that behaviour.
The judge was right to dismiss the customers claim against the petrol company.
At the time of the incident the relationship between the plaintiff and the attendant had changed from that of customer and representative of the petrol company to that of a person making a complaint to the police and the subject of the complaint.
In Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2002] 1 AC 215 Lord Millett commented, at para 80, that the better view may have been that the employer was not liable because it was no part of the duties of the pump attendant to keep order, but there is no suggestion in the report of the case that there was any other employee in practical charge of the forecourt and cash desk area.
If the attendant had punched the customer because he believed, rightly or wrongly, that the customer was leaving without payment, I would regard such conduct as occurring within the course of his employment.
In Keppel Bus Co Ltd v Ahmad [1974] 1 WLR 1082 the plaintiff was travelling in a bus when the conductor treated an elderly lady passenger in a high handed and rude fashion.
The plaintiff remonstrated with him.
An altercation followed in which each tried to hit the other.
They were separated by the passengers, but the conductor struck the plaintiff in the eye with his ticket punch, causing loss of sight in the eye.
The trial judge and the Singapore Court of Appeal held that the bus company was vicariously liable, but the Privy Council decided otherwise.
The Board applied the Salmond formula.
It held that the conductors conduct could not be described as a wrong mode of performing the work which he was expressly or impliedly authorised to do.
He could not be described as maintaining order in the bus; if anyone was keeping order in the bus, it was the passengers.
The Board rejected the argument that his job could be described as managing the bus and that his conduct arose out of his power and duty to do so.
The case illustrates again the awkwardness of the Salmond formula when applied to such situations.
Looked at more broadly, the bus company selected the conductor for employment and put him in charge of the passenger area of the bus.
He abused the position of authority which his employment gave him.
Because he was throwing his weight around as the conductor, the plaintiff objected.
Because the conductor objected to what he appeared to regard as interference with the exercise of his authority, he struck the plaintiff in the face. (The trial judge summarised it by saying that He was in effect telling the plaintiff by his act not to interfere with him in his due performance of his duties: p 1084.) In such circumstances it was just that the passenger should be able to look to the company for compensation.
In two noteworthy cases the court took a broader approach to the question of scope of employment.
Their significance is enhanced by the fact that they were cited with approval in Lister.
796, 802, Lord Cullen said: In Central Motors (Glasgow) Ltd v Cessnock Garage and Motor Co 1925 SC The question is not to be answered merely by applying the test whether the act in itself is one which the servant was authorised or ordered or forbidden to do.
The employer has to shoulder responsibility on a wider basis; and he may, and often does, become responsible to third parties for acts which he has expressly or impliedly forbidden the servant to do.
It remains necessary to the masters responsibility that the servants act be one done within the sphere of his service or the scope of his employment, but it may have this character although it consists in doing something which is the very opposite of what the servant has been intended or ordered to do, and which he does for his own private ends.
An honest master does not employ or authorise his servant to commit crimes of dishonesty towards third parties; but nevertheless he may incur liability for a crime of dishonesty committed by the servant if it was committed by him within the field of activities which the employment assigned to him, and that although the crime was committed by the servant solely in pursuance of his own private advantage.
The expression within the field of activities assigned to the employee is helpful.
It conjures a wider range of conduct than acts done in furtherance of his employment.
In Rose v Plenty [1976] 1 WLR 141 a milk roundsman paid a 13 year old boy to help him collect and deliver milk bottles, in disregard of his employers rule prohibiting children from being carried on milk floats.
The boy was injured when he fell off a milk float as a result of the employees negligent driving.
The trial judge dismissed the boys claim against the employer on the ground that the employee was acting outside the scope of his employment and that the boy was a trespasser on the float, but his decision was reversed by a majority of the Court of Appeal.
Lord Denning, MR dealt with the matter briefly, holding that in taking the boy on the milk float the employee was still acting within the sphere of his employment.
Scarman LJ considered the point at greater length, at pp 147 148: In words which have frequently been quoted both in the courts and in the universities, Salmond on Torts, 16th ed (1973), p 462, refers to the basis of vicarious liability for accidental damage as being one of public policy.
That view is supported by quotations (dated no doubt, but still full of life) of a dictum of Lord Brougham and of another, 100 years or more earlier, of Sir John Holt.
That it is socially convenient and rough justice to make an employer liable for the torts of his servant in the cases to which the principle applies, was recognised in Limpus v London General Omnibus Co, 1 H & C 526; see the judgment of Willes J at p 539.
I think it important to realise that the principle of vicarious liability is one of public policy.
It is not a principle which derives from a critical or refined consideration of other concepts in the common law, for example, the concept of trespass or indeed the concept of agency.
No doubt in particular cases it may be relevant to consider whether a particular plaintiff was or was not a trespasser.
Similarly, when, as I shall indicate, it is important that one should determine the course of employment of the servant, the law of agency may have some marginal relevance.
But basically, as I understand it, the employer is made vicariously liable for the tort of his employee not because the plaintiff is an invitee, nor because of the authority possessed by the servant, but because it is a case in which the employer, having put matters into motion, should be liable if the motion which he has originated leads to damage to another.
What is the approach which the cases identify as the correct approach in order to determine this question of public policy? First, one looks to see whether the servant has committed a tort upon the plaintiff The next question is whether the employer should shoulder the liability for compensating the person injured by the tort [I]t does appear to me to be clear, since the decision of Limpus v London General Omnibus Co, 1 H & C 526, that that question has to be answered by directing attention to what the servant was employed to do when he committed the tort that has caused damage to the plaintiff.
The servant was, of course, employed at the time of the accident to do a whole number of operations.
He was certainly not employed to give the boy a lift, and if one confines ones analysis of the facts to the incident of injury to the plaintiff, then no doubt one would say that carrying the boy on the float giving him a lift was not in the course of the servants employment.
But in Ilkiw v Samuels [1963] 1 WLR 991 Diplock LJ indicated that the proper approach to the nature of the servants employment is a broad one.
He says, at p 1004: As each of these nouns implies he is referring to the nouns used to describe course of employment, sphere, scope and so forth the matter must be looked at broadly, not dissecting the servants task into its component activities such as driving, loading, sheeting and the like by asking: what was the job on which he was engaged for his employer? and answering that question as a jury would.
Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd
In Lister the House of Lords was faced with the problem of the application of the doctrine of vicarious liability to the warden of a school boarding house who sexually abused the children in his care.
The Salmond formula was stretched to breaking point.
Even on its most elastic interpretation, the sexual abuse of the children could not be described as a mode, albeit an improper mode, of caring for them.
Drawing on Scarman LJs approach, Lord Steyn (with whom Lords Hutton and Hobhouse agreed) spoke of the pitfalls of terminology and said that it was not necessary to ask whether the acts of sexual abuse were modes of doing authorised acts.
He posed the broad question whether the wardens torts was so closely connected with his employment that it would be just to hold the employers liable.
He concluded that the employers were vicariously liable because they undertook the care of the children through the warden and he abused them.
There was therefore a close connection between his employment and his tortious acts.
To similar effect, Lord Clyde said that the warden had a general duty to look after the children, and the fact that he abused them did not sever the connection with his employment; his acts had to be seen in the context that he was entrusted with responsibility for their care, and it was right that his employers should be liable for the way in which he behaved towards them as warden of the house.
In adopting the approach which he did, Lord Steyn referred to the judgment of McLachlin J in Bazley v Curry (1999) 174 DLR (4th) 45.
McLachlin J summarised the public policy justification for imposing vicarious liability, at para 31, in a similar fashion to Holt and Scarman LJ: The employer puts in the community an enterprise which carries with it certain risks.
When those risks materialize and cause injury to a member of the public despite the employers reasonable efforts, it is fair that the person or organisation that creates the enterprise and hence the risk should bear the loss.
Compare Scarman LJs statement that the employer, having put matters into motion, should be liable if the motion which he has originated leads to damage to another.
This thinking has been prominent in cases since Lister as the social underpinning of the doctrine of vicarious liability, but the court is not required in each case to conduct a retrospective assessment of the degree to which the employee would have been considered to present a risk.
As Immanuel Kant wrote, Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.
The risk of an employee misusing his position is one of lifes unavoidable facts.
In Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48; [2003] 2 AC 366, the House of Lords applied the Lister approach to vicarious liability in a case of commercial fraud.
Lord Nicholls (with whom Lords Slynn and Hutton agreed) said: 22. [I]t is a fact of life, and therefore to be expected by those who carry on businesses, that sometimes their agents may exceed the bounds of their authority or even defy express instructions.
It is fair to allocate risk of losses thus arising to the businesses rather than leave those wronged with the sole remedy, of doubtful value, against the individual employee who committed the wrong.
To this end, the law has given the concept of ordinary course of employment an extended scope.
If, then, authority is not the touchstone, what is? . 23.
Perhaps the best general answer is that the wrongful conduct must be so closely connected with acts the partner or employee was authorised to do that, for the purpose of the liability of the firm or the employer to third parties, the wrongful act may fairly and properly be regarded as done by the partner while acting in the ordinary course of the firms business or the employees employment (Original emphasis) 25.
This close connection test focuses attention in the right direction.
But it affords no guidance on the type or degree of connection which will normally be regarded as sufficiently close to prompt the legal conclusion that the risk of the wrongful act occurring, and any loss flowing from the wrongful act, should fall on the firm or employer rather than the third party who was wronged. 26.
This lack of precision is inevitable, given the infinite range of circumstances where the issue arises.
The crucial feature or features, either producing or negativing vicarious liability, vary widely from one case or type of case to the next.
Essentially the court makes an evaluative judgment in each case, having regard to all the circumstances and, importantly, having regard to the assistance provided by previous court decisions.
The close connection test adumbrated in Lister and Dubai Aluminium has been followed in a line of later cases including several at the highest level: Bernard v Attorney General of Jamaica [2004] UKPC 47; [2005] IRLR 398, Brown v Robinson [2004] UKPC 56, Majrowski v Guys and St Thomass NHS Trust [2006] UKHL 34; [2007] 1 AC 224 and Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKHL 56; [2013] 2 AC 1 (the Christian Brothers case).
In the Christian Brothers case Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers said at para 74 that it is not easy to deduce from Lister the precise criteria that will give rise to vicarious liability for sexual abuse (or, he might have added, other abuse), and that the test of close connection tells one nothing about the nature of the connection.
However, in Lister the court was mindful of the risk of over concentration on a particular form of terminology, and there is a similar risk in attempting to over refine, or lay down a list of criteria for determining, what precisely amounts to a sufficiently close connection to make it just for the employer to be held vicariously liable.
Simplification of the essence is more desirable.
The present law
In the simplest terms, the court has to consider two matters.
The first question is what functions or field of activities have been entrusted by the employer to the employee, or, in everyday language, what was the nature of his job.
As has been emphasised in several cases, this question must be addressed broadly; see in particular the passage in Diplock LJs judgment in Ilkiw v Samuels [1963] 1 WLR 991, 1004 included in the citation from Rose v Plenty at para 38 above, and cited also in Lister by Lord Steyn at para 20, Lord Clyde at para 42, Lord Hobhouse at para 58 and Lord Millett at para 77.
Secondly, the court must decide whether there was sufficient connection between the position in which he was employed and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the employer to be held liable under the principle of social justice which goes back to Holt.
To try to measure the closeness of connection, as it were, on a scale of 1 to 10, would be a forlorn exercise and, what is more, it would miss the point.
The cases in which the necessary connection has been found for Holts principle to be applied are cases in which the employee used or misused the position entrusted to him in a way which injured the third party.
Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co, Peterson and Lister were all cases in which the employee misused his position in a way which injured the claimant, and that is the reason why it was just that the employer who selected him and put him in that position should be held responsible.
By contrast, in Warren v Henlys Ltd any misbehaviour by the petrol pump attendant, qua petrol pump attendant, was past history by the time that he assaulted the claimant.
The claimant had in the meantime left the scene, and the context in which the assault occurred was that he had returned with the police officer to pursue a complaint against the attendant.
Contrary to the primary submission advanced on the claimants behalf, I am not persuaded that there is anything wrong with the Lister approach as such.
It has been affirmed many times and I do not see that the law would now be improved by a change of vocabulary.
Indeed, the more the argument developed, the less clear it became whether the claimant was advocating a different approach as a matter of substance and, if so, what the difference of substance was.
The present case
In the present case it was Mr Khans job to attend to customers and to respond to their inquiries.
His conduct in answering the claimants request in a foul mouthed way and ordering him to leave was inexcusable but within the field of activities assigned to him.
What happened thereafter was an unbroken sequence of events.
It was argued by the respondent and accepted by the judge that there ceased to be any significant connection between Mr Khans employment and his behaviour towards the claimant when he came out from behind the counter and followed the claimant onto the forecourt.
I disagree for two reasons.
First, I do not consider that it is right to regard him as having metaphorically taken off his uniform the moment he stepped from behind the counter.
He was following up on what he had said to the claimant.
It was a seamless episode.
Secondly, when Mr Khan followed the claimant back to his car and opened the front passenger door, he again told the claimant in threatening words that he was never to come back to the petrol station.
This was not something personal between them; it was an order to keep away from his employers premises, which he reinforced by violence.
In giving such an order he was purporting to act about his employers business.
It was a gross abuse of his position, but it was in connection with the business in which he was employed to serve customers.
His employers entrusted him with that position and it is just that as between them and the claimant, they should be held responsible for their employees abuse of it.
Mr Khans motive is irrelevant.
It looks obvious that he was motivated by personal racism rather than a desire to benefit his employers business, but that is neither here nor there.
LORD DYSON:
As Lord Toulson has explained, the test for holding an employer vicariously liable for the tort of his employee has troubled the courts for many years.
The close connection test (whether the employees tort is so closely connected with his employment that it would be just to hold the employer liable) was first articulated in this jurisdiction by the House of Lords in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2002] 1 AC 215.
It has been subsequently followed in many cases, including several at the highest level: see para 42 above.
As Lord Nicholls said in Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48; [2003] 2 AC 366, para 26, the test is imprecise, but that is inevitable given the infinite range of circumstances where the issue of vicarious liability arises.
The court, he said, has to make an evaluative judgment in each case, having regard to all the circumstances and to the assistance provided by previous court decisions on the facts of other cases.
I would allow the appeal.
The appellant in his application for permission to appeal in the present case argued that this court should reformulate the close connection test.
In his written case, he submitted that it should be refined or replaced altogether in order to reflect modern views of justice; to advance the doctrines underlying policy considerations [underlying vicarious liability]; and to set clearer and less arbitrary boundaries.
Accordingly, he submitted that the test for vicarious liability should be whether the employee (described as an authorised representative of the employer) commits the tort in circumstances where the reasonable observer would consider the employee to be acting in that representative capacity.
The close connection test has now been repeatedly applied by our courts for some 13 years.
In my view, it should only be abrogated or refined if a demonstrably better test can be devised.
Far from being demonstrably better, the proposed new test is hopelessly vague.
What does representative capacity mean in this context? And by what criteria is the court to determine the circumstances in which the reasonable observer would consider the employee to be acting in a representative capacity? I do not see how this test is more precise than the close connection test or how it better reflects modern views of justice.
The attraction of the close connection test is that it is firmly rooted in justice.
It asks whether the employees tort is so closely connected with his employment as to make it just to hold the employer liable.
It is true that the test is imprecise.
But this is an area of the law in which, as Lord Nicholls said, imprecision is inevitable.
To search for certainty and precision in vicarious liability is to undertake a quest for a chimaera.
Many aspects of the law of torts are inherently imprecise.
For example, the imprecise concepts of fairness, justice and reasonableness are central to the law of negligence.
The test for the existence of a duty of care is whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose such a duty.
The test for remoteness of loss is one of reasonable foreseeability.
Questions such as whether to impose a duty of care and whether loss is recoverable are not always easy to answer because they are imprecise.
But these tests are now well established in our law.
To adopt the words of Lord Nicholls, the court has to make an evaluative judgment in each case having regard to all the circumstances and having regard to the assistance provided by previous decisions on the facts of other cases.
In Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56; [2013] 2 AC 1 Lord Phillips said at para 19 the law of vicarious liability is on the move.
It is true that there have been developments in the law as to the type of relationship that has to exist between an individual and a defendant for vicarious liability to be imposed on the defendant in respect of a tort committed by that individual.
These developments have been a response to changes in the legal relationships between enterprises and members of their workforces and the increasing complexity and sophistication of the organisation of enterprises in the modern world.
A good example is provided by the facts of the Catholic Child Welfare Society case itself.
But there is no need for the law governing the circumstances in which an employer should be held vicariously liable for a tort committed by his employee to be on the move.
There have been no changes in societal conditions which require such a development.
The changes in the case law relating to the definition of the circumstances in which an employer is vicariously liable for the tort of his employee have not been made in response to changing social conditions.
Rather they have been prompted by the aim of producing a fairer and more workable test.
Unsurprisingly, this basic aim has remained constant.
The Salmond test defined a wrongful act by a servant in the course of his employment as either (a) a wrongful act authorised by the master or (b) a wrongful and unauthorised mode of doing some act authorised by the master: Salmond, Law of Torts, 1st ed (1907), p 83; and Salmond & Heuston on the Law of Torts, 21st ed (1996), p 443.
As Lord Steyn said in Lister at para 20, this was simply a practical test serving as a dividing line between cases where it is or is not just to impose vicarious liability (emphasis added).
The importance of Lister (and the Canadian case of Bazley v Curry (1999) 174 DLR (4th) 45 whose reasoning it adopted) is that it recognised the difficulty created by the second limb of the Salmond test.
This was not effective for determining the circumstances in which it was just to hold an employer vicariously liable for committing an act not authorised by the employer.
The close connection test was introduced in order to remedy this shortcoming.
This improvement was achieved by the simple expedient of explicitly incorporating the concept of justice into the close connection test.
The new test was, therefore, by definition more effective than the Salmond test for determining the circumstances in which it is just to hold an employer vicariously liable for the unauthorised acts of his employee.
It is difficult to see how the close connection test might be further refined.
It is sufficient to say that no satisfactory refinement of the test has been suggested in the present case.
As regards the facts of the present case, I agree with the analysis of Lord Toulson and the reasons he gives at paras 47 and 48 for holding that the defendants are liable for the assault committed by Mr Khan.
For these reasons as well as those given by Lord Toulson, I would allow this appeal.
","On 15 March 2008 the Claimant entered the Respondents premises in Small Heath, Birmingham which include a petrol station and a kiosk where customers pay for their purchases.
Having parked his car he entered the kiosk to ask whether he could print some documents from a USB stick.
Mr Amjid Khan was behind the kiosk desk, employed by the Respondent to see that petrol pumps and the kiosk were kept in good order and to serve customers.
Mr Khan refused the Claimants request in a rude manner, at which the Claimant protested.
Mr Khan responded in foul, racist and threatening language and ordered the Claimant to leave.
The Claimant returned to his car followed by Mr Khan.
Before the Claimant could drive off, Mr Khan opened the passenger door, told the Claimant in threatening words never to return and punched him on the left temple.
The Claimant got out and walked round to close the passenger door when Mr Khan subjected him to a serious attack.
The Claimant had not done anything which could be considered aggressive or abusive.
The Claimant brought proceedings against the Respondent on the basis that it was vicariously liable for the actions of its employee Mr Khan.
The trial judge dismissed the claim because he considered that there was an insufficiently close connection between what Mr Khan was employed to do and his tortious conduct in attacking the Claimant for the Respondent to be liable.
The Court of Appeal upheld the judges decision.
The Claimant appealed, challenging whether the close connection test was the appropriate standard to apply and also arguing that his claim should have succeeded in any event.
The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Claimants appeal and holds the Respondent vicariously liable for the actions of its employee, Mr Khan, in attacking the Claimant.
Lord Toulson gives the lead judgment.
The close connection test has been followed at the highest level [42] and there is nothing wrong with it as such [46].
In the present case, the court has to consider two matters.
First, the court must ask what function or field of activities has been entrusted by the employer to the employee (i.e. what was the nature of his job).
This is to be viewed broadly [44].
Second, the court must decide whether there was a sufficient connection between the position in which he was employed and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the employer to be held liable [45].
Applying that test here, it was Mr Khans job to attend to customers and respond to their inquiries.
His conduct in responding to the Claimants request with abuse was inexcusable, but interacting with customers was within the field of activities assigned to him by his employer.
What happened thereafter was an unbroken sequence of events.
The connection between the field of activities assigned to Mr Khan and his employment did not cease at the moment when he came out from behind the counter and followed the Claimant onto the forecourt.
There are two reasons to draw this conclusion.
First, it is not correct to regard Mr Khan as having metaphorically taken off his uniform the moment he stepped out from behind the counter he was following up on what he said to the Claimant.
Secondly, when Mr Khan followed the Claimant to his car and told him not to come back to the petrol station, that was not something personal between them, but an order to keep away from his employers premises.
In giving the order he was purporting to act about his employers business [47].
Mr Khans motive in the attack is irrelevant.
It does not matter whether he was motivated by personal racism rather than a desire to benefit his employers business [48].
Lord Dyson agrees with the reasons given by Lord Toulson [57] and emphasises that the close connection test is the correct test to apply [53].
"
uksc-2017-0115,"The question at issue on this appeal is: in what circumstances is it permissible to sue an unnamed defendant? It arises in a rather special context in which the problem is not uncommon.
On 26 May 2013 Ms Bianca Cameron was injured when her car collided with a Nissan Micra.
It is common ground that the incident was due to the negligence of the driver of the Micra.
The registration number of the Micra was recorded, but the driver made off without stopping or reporting the accident to the police and has not been heard of since.
The registered keeper of the Micra was Mr Naveed Hussain, who was not the driver but has declined to identify the driver and has been convicted of failing to do so.
The car was insured under a policy issued by Liverpool Victoria Insurance Co Ltd to a Mr Nissar Bahadur, whom the company believes to be a fictitious person.
Neither Mr Hussain nor the driver was insured under the policy to drive the car.
The statutory framework
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to introduce compulsory motor insurance.
It originated with the Road Traffic Act 1930, which was part of a package of measures to protect accident victims, including the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930.
The latter Act entitled a person to claim directly against the insurer where an insured tortfeasor was insolvent.
But it was shortly superseded as regards motor accidents by the Road Traffic Act 1934, which required motor insurers to satisfy any judgment against their insured and restricted the right of insurers to rely as against third parties on certain categories of policy exception or on the right of avoidance for non disclosure or misrepresentation.
The statutory regime has become more elaborate and more comprehensive since 1934, but the basic framework has not changed.
The current legislation is Part VI of the Road Traffic Act 1988.
As originally enacted, it sought to give effect to the first three EEC Motor Insurance Directives, 72/166/EEC, 84/5/EEC and 90/232/EEC.
It was subsequently amended by statutory instruments under the European Communities Act 1972 to reflect the terms of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Motor Insurance Directives 2000/26/EC, 2005/14/EC and 2009/103/EC.
The object of the current legislation is to enable the victims of negligently caused road accidents to recover, if not from the tortfeasor then from his insurer or, failing that, from a fund operated by the motor insurance industry.
Under section 143 of the Act of 1988 it is an offence to use or to cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle on a road or other public place unless there is in force a policy of insurance against third party risks in relation to the use of the vehicle by the particular driver (I disregard the statutory provision for the giving of security in lieu of insurance).
Section 145 requires the policy to cover specified risks, including bodily injury and damage to property.
Section 151(5) requires the insurer, subject to certain conditions, to satisfy any judgment falling within subsection (2).
This means (omitting words irrelevant to this appeal) judgments relating to a liability with respect to any matter where liability with respect to that matter is required to be covered by a policy of insurance under section 145 of this Act and either (a) it is a liability covered by the terms of the policy or security , and the judgment is obtained against any person who is insured by the policy or it is a liability which would be so covered if (b) the policy insured all persons , and the judgment is obtained against any person other than one who is insured by the policy The effect of the latter subsection is that an insurer who has issued a policy in respect of the use of a vehicle is liable on a judgment, even where it was obtained against a person such as the driver of the Micra in this case who was not insured to drive it.
The statutory liability of the insurer to satisfy judgments is subject to an exception under section 152 where it is entitled to avoid the policy for non disclosure or misrepresentation and has obtained a declaration to that effect in proceedings begun within a prescribed time period.
But the operation of section 152 is currently under review in the light of recent decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Under section 145(2), the policy must have been issued by an authorised insurer.
This means a member of the Motor Insurers Bureau: see sections 95(2) and 145(5).
The Bureau has an important place in the statutory scheme for protecting the victims of road accidents in the United Kingdom.
Following a recommendation of the Cassell Committee, which reported in 1937 (Cmnd 5528/1937), the Bureau was created in 1946 to manage a fund for compensating victims of uninsured motorists.
It is a private company owned and funded by all insurers authorised to write motor business in the United Kingdom.
It has entered into agreements with the Secretary of State to compensate third party victims of road accidents who fall through the compulsory insurance net even under the enlarged coverage provided by section 151(2)(b).
This means victims suffering personal injury or property damage caused by (i) vehicles in respect of which no policy of insurance has been issued; and (ii) drivers who cannot be traced.
These categories are covered by two agreements with the Secretary of State, the Uninsured Drivers Agreement and the Untraced Drivers Agreement respectively.
The relevant agreement covering Ms Camerons case was the 2003 Untraced Drivers Agreement.
It applied to persons suffering death, bodily injury or property damage arising out of the use of a motor vehicle in cases where it is not possible to identify the person who is or appears to be liable: see clause 4(d).
The measure of indemnity under this agreement is not always total.
Under clause 10, there is a limit to the Bureaus liability for legal costs; and under clause 8 the indemnity for property damage is subject to a modest excess (at the relevant time 300) and a maximum limit corresponding to the minimum level of compulsory insurance (at the relevant time 1,000,000).
The Bureau assumes liability under the Uninsured Drivers Agreement in cases where the insurer has a defence under the provisions governing avoided policies in section 152.
But under article 75 of the Bureaus articles of association, each insurer binds itself to meet the Bureaus liability to satisfy a judgment in favour of the third party in such cases.
In 2017, there were 17,700 concluded applications to the Motor Insurers Bureau by victims of untraced drivers.
It is a fundamental feature of the statutory scheme of compulsory insurance in the United Kingdom that it confers on the victim of a road accident no direct right against an insurer in respect of the underlying liability of the driver.
The only direct right against the insurer is the right to require it to satisfy a judgment against the driver, once the latters liability has been established in legal proceedings.
This reflects a number of features of motor insurance in the United Kingdom which originated well before the relevant European legislation bound the United Kingdom, and which differentiate it from many continental systems.
In the first place, policies of motor insurance in the United Kingdom normally cover drivers rather than vehicles.
Section 151(2)(b) of the Act (quoted above) produces a close but not complete approximation to the continental position.
Secondly, the rule of English insurance law is that an insurer is liable to no one but its insured, even when the risks insured include liabilities owed by the insured to third parties.
Subject to limited statutory exceptions, the third party has no direct right against the insurer.
Thirdly, even the insured cannot claim against his liability insurer unless and until his liability has been ascertained in legal proceedings or by agreement or admission.
The Untraced Drivers Agreement assumes that judgment cannot be obtained against the driver if he cannot be identified, and therefore that no liability will attach to the insurer in that case.
This is why it is accepted as a liability of the Motor Insurance Bureau.
On the present appeal, Ms Cameron seeks to challenge that assumption.
Such a challenge is usually unnecessary.
It is cheaper and quicker to claim against the Bureau.
But for reasons which remain unclear, in spite of her counsels attempt to explain them, Ms Cameron has elected not to do that.
The proceedings
Ms Cameron initially sued Mr Hussain for damages.
The proceedings were then amended to add a claim against Liverpool Victoria Insurance for a declaration that it would be liable to meet any judgment obtained against Mr Hussain.
The insurer served a defence which denied liability on the ground that there was no right to obtain a judgment against Mr Hussain, because there was no evidence that he was the driver at the relevant time.
Ms Camerons response was to apply in the Liverpool Civil and Family Court to amend her claim form and particulars of claim so as to substitute for Mr Hussain the person unknown driving vehicle registration number Y598 SPS who collided with vehicle registration number KG03 ZJZ on 26 May 2013.
District Judge Wright dismissed that application and entered summary judgment for the insurer.
Judge Parker dismissed Ms Camerons appeal.
But a further appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed by a majority (Gloster and Lloyd Jones LJJ, Sir Ross Cranston dissenting): [2018] 1 WLR 657.
Gloster LJ delivered the leading judgment.
She held that the policy of the legislation was to ensure that the third party victims of negligent drivers received compensation from insurers whenever a policy had been issued in respect of the vehicle, irrespective of who the driver was.
In her judgment, the court had a discretion to permit an unknown person to be sued whenever justice required it.
Justice required it when the driver could not be identified, because otherwise it would not be possible to obtain a judgment which the issuer of a policy in respect of the car would be bound to satisfy.
The majority considered it to be irrelevant that Ms Cameron had an alternative right against the Motor Insurance Bureau.
She had a right against the driver and, upon getting judgment against him, against the insurer.
In principle she was entitled to choose between remedies.
Sir Ross Cranston dissented.
He agreed that there was a discretion, but he did not consider that justice required an action to be allowed against the unknown driver when compensation was available from the Motor Insurance Bureau.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal (i) gave Ms Cameron permission to amend the claim form so as to sue the driver under the above description; (ii) directed under CPR 6.15 that service on the insurer should constitute service on the driver and that further service on the driver should be dispensed with; and (iii) gave judgment against the driver, as described, recording in their order that the insurer accepted that it was liable to satisfy that judgment.
Suing unnamed persons
Before the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 abolished the practice, it was common to constitute actions for trespass with fictional parties, generally John (or Jane) Doe or Roe, in order to avoid the restrictions imposed on possession proceedings by the forms of action.
Placeholders such as these were also occasionally named as parties where the identity of the real party was unknown, a practice which subsists in the United States and Canada.
After the disappearance of this practice in England, the extent of any right to sue unnamed persons was governed by rules of court.
The basic rule before 1999 was laid down by the Court of Appeal in 1926 in Friern Barnet Urban District Council v Adams [1927] 2 Ch 25.
The Friern Barnet District Council had a statutory right to recover the cost of making up Alexandra Road from the proprietors of the adjoining lands, but in the days before registered title reached Friern Barnet it had no way of discovering who they were.
It therefore began proceedings against a named individual who was not concerned and the owners of certain lands adjoining Alexandra Road, whose names and addresses are not known to the plaintiffs.
The judge struck out these words and declined to order substituted service by affixing copies of the writ to posts on the relevant land.
The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.
They held that there was no power to issue a writ in this form because the prescribed form of writ required it to be directed to C D of, etc in the County of (p 30).
When the Civil Procedure Rules were introduced in 1999, the function of prescribing the manner in which proceedings should be commenced was taken over by CPR Part 7.
The general rule remains that proceedings may not be brought against unnamed parties.
This is implicit in the limited exceptions contemplated by the Rules.
CPR 8.2A provides that a practice direction may set out circumstances in which a claim form may be issued under this Part without naming a defendant.
It is envisaged that permission will be required, but that the notice of application for permission need not be served on any other person.
However, no such practice direction has been made.
The only express provision made for proceedings against an unnamed defendant, other than representative actions, is CPR 55.3(4), which permits a claim for possession of property to be brought against trespassers whose names are unknown.
This is the successor to RSC Order 113, which was introduced in order to provide a means of obtaining injunctions against unidentifiable squatters, following the decision of Stamp J in In re Wykeham Terrace, Brighton, Sussex, Ex p Territorial Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve Association for the South East [1971] Ch 204, that they could not be sued if they could not be named.
In addition, there are specific statutory exceptions to broadly the same effect, such as the exception for proceedings for an injunction to restrain any actual or apprehended breach of planning controls under section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
Section 187B(3) provides that rules of court may provide for such an injunction to be issued against a person whose identity is unknown.
The Rules are supplemented by a practice direction which deals with the administrative steps involved.
CPR 7A PD4.1 provides that a claim form must be headed with the title of the proceedings, which should state, among other things, the full name of each party.
English judges have allowed some exceptions.
They have permitted representative actions where the representative can be named but some or all of the class cannot.
They have allowed actions and orders against unnamed wrongdoers where some of the wrongdoers were known so they could be sued both personally and as representing their unidentified associates.
This technique has been used, for example, in actions against copyright pirates: see EMI Records Ltd v Kudhail [1985] FSR 35.
But the possibility of a much wider jurisdiction was first opened up by the decision of Sir Andrew Morritt V C in Bloomsbury Publishing Group Plc v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2003] 1 WLR 1633.
The claimant in that case was the publisher of the Harry Potter novels.
Copies of the latest book in the series had been stolen from the printers before publication and offered to the press by unnamed persons.
An injunction was granted in proceedings against the person or persons who have offered the publishers of The Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror newspapers a copy of the book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J K Rowling or any part thereof and the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the claimants.
The real object of the injunction was to deter newspapers minded to publish parts of the text, who would expose themselves to proceedings for contempt of court by dealing with the thieves with notice of the order.
The Vice Chancellor held that the decision in Friern Barnet Urban District Council v Adams had no application under the Civil Procedure Rules; that the decision of Stamp J in In re Wykeham Terrace was wrong; and that the words should state in CPR 7A PD4.1 were not mandatory, but imported a discretion to depart from the practice in appropriate cases.
In his view, a person could be sued by a description, provided that the description was sufficiently certain as to identify both those who are included and those who are not (para 21).
Since this decision, the jurisdiction has regularly been invoked.
Judging by the reported cases, there has recently been a significant increase in its use.
The main contexts for its exercise have been abuse of the internet, that powerful tool for anonymous wrongdoing; and trespasses and other torts committed by protesters, demonstrators and paparazzi.
Cases in the former context include Brett Wilson LLP v Persons Unknown [2016] 4 WLR 69 and Smith v Unknown Defendant Pseudonym Likeicare [2016] EWHC 1775 (QB) (defamation); Middleton v Person Unknown [2016] EWHC 2354 (QB) (theft of information by hackers); PML v Persons Unknown [2018] EWHC 703 (QB) (hacking and blackmail); CMOC v Persons Unknown [2017] EWHC 3599 (Comm) (hacking and theft of funds).
Cases decided in the second context include Hampshire Waste Services Ltd v Intending Trespassers upon Chineham Incinerator Site [2004] Env LR 9; Ineos Upstream Ltd v Persons Unknown [2017] EWHC 2945 (Ch); UK Oil and Gas Investments Plc v Persons Unknown [2018] EWHC 2253 (Ch).
In some of these cases, proceedings against persons unknown were allowed in support of an application for a quia timet injunction, where the defendants could be identified only as those persons who might in future commit the relevant acts.
The majority of the Court of Appeal followed this body of case law in deciding that an action was permissible against the unknown driver of the Micra who injured Ms Cameron.
This is the first occasion on which the basis and extent of the jurisdiction has been considered by the Supreme Court or the House of Lords.
The Civil Procedure Rules neither expressly authorise nor expressly prohibit exceptions to the general rule that actions against unnamed parties are permissible only against trespassers.
The prescribed forms include a space in which to designate the claimant and the defendant, a format which is equally consistent with their being designated by name or by description.
The only requirement for a name is contained in a practice direction.
But unlike the Civil Procedure Rules, which are made under statutory powers, a practice direction is no more than guidance on matters of practice issued under the authority of the heads of division.
As to those matters, it is binding on judges sitting in the jurisdiction with which it is concerned: Bovale Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2009] 1 WLR 2274.
But it has no statutory force, and cannot alter the general law.
Whether or not the requirement of CPR 7A PD4.1 that the claim form should state the defendants full name admits of a discretion on the point, is not therefore the critical question.
The critical question is what, as a matter of law, is the basis of the courts jurisdiction over parties, and in what (if any) circumstances can jurisdiction be exercised on that basis against persons who cannot be named.
In approaching this question, it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of case in which the defendant cannot be named, to which different considerations apply.
The first category comprises anonymous defendants who are identifiable but whose names are unknown.
Squatters occupying a property are, for example, identifiable by their location, although they cannot be named.
The second category comprises defendants, such as most hit and run drivers, who are not only anonymous but cannot even be identified.
The distinction is that in the first category the defendant is described in a way that makes it possible in principle to locate or communicate with him and to know without further inquiry whether he is the same as the person described in the claim form, whereas in the second category it is not.
This appeal is primarily concerned with the issue or amendment of the claim form.
It is not directly concerned with its service, which occurs under the rules up to four months after issue, subject to extension by order of the court.
There is no doubt that a claim form may be issued against a named defendant, although it is not yet known where or how or indeed whether he can in practice be served.
But the legitimacy of issuing or amending a claim form so as to sue an unnamed defendant can properly be tested by asking whether it is conceptually (not just practically) possible to serve it.
The court generally acts in personam.
Although an action is completely constituted on the issue of the claim form, for example for the purpose of stopping the running of a limitation period, the general rule is that service of originating process is the act by which the defendant is subjected to the courts jurisdiction: Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] 1 WLR 1119, para 8.
The court may grant interim relief before the proceedings have been served or even issued, but that is an emergency jurisdiction which is both provisional and strictly conditional.
In Dresser UK Ltd v Falcongate Freight Management Ltd [1992] QB 502, the Court of Appeal held that, for the purposes of the Brussels Convention (the relevant provisions of the Brussels Regulation are different), an English court was seised of an action when the writ was served, not when it was issued.
This was because of the legal status of an unserved writ in English law.
Bingham LJ described that status, at p 523, as follows: it is in my judgment artificial, far fetched and wrong to hold that the English court is seised of proceedings, or that proceedings are decisively, conclusively, finally or definitively pending before it, upon mere issue of proceedings, when at that stage (1) the courts involvement has been confined to a ministerial act by a relatively junior administrative officer; (2) the plaintiff has an unfettered choice whether to pursue the action and serve the proceedings or not, being in breach of no rule or obligation if he chooses to let the writ expire unserved; (3) the plaintiffs claim may be framed in terms of the utmost generality; (4) the defendant is usually unaware of the issue of proceedings and, if unaware, is unable to call on the plaintiff to serve the writ or discontinue the action and unable to rely on the commencement of the action as a lis alibi pendens if proceedings are begun elsewhere; (5) the defendant is not obliged to respond to the plaintiffs claim in any way, and not entitled to do so save by calling on the plaintiff to serve or discontinue; (6) the court cannot exercise any powers which, on appropriate facts, it could not have exercised before issue; (7) the defendant has not become subject to the jurisdiction of the court.
The case was decided under the Rules of the Supreme Court.
But Bingham LJs statement would be equally true (mechanics and terminology apart) of an unserved claim form under the Civil Procedure Rules.
An identifiable but anonymous defendant can be served with the claim form or other originating process, if necessary by alternative service under CPR 6.15.
This is because it is possible to locate or communicate with the defendant and to identify him as the person described in the claim form.
Thus, in proceedings against anonymous trespassers under CPR 55.3(4), service must be effected in accordance with CPR 55.6 by attaching copies of the documents to the main door or placing them in some other prominent place on the land where the trespassers are to be found, and posting them if practical through the letter box.
In Brett Wilson LLP v Persons Unknown, supra, alternative service was effected by email to a website which had published defamatory matter, Warby J observing (para 11) that the relevant procedural safeguards must of course be applied.
In Smith v Unknown Defendant Pseudonym Likeicare, supra, Green J made the same observation (para 11) in another case of internet defamation where service was effected in the same way.
Where an interim injunction is granted and can be specifically enforced against some property or by notice to third parties who would necessarily be involved in any contempt, the process of enforcing it will sometimes be enough to bring the proceedings to the defendants attention.
In Bloomsbury Publishing Group, for example, the unnamed defendants would have had to identify themselves as the persons in physical possession of copies of the book if they had sought to do the prohibited act, namely disclose it to people (such as newspapers) who had been notified of the injunction.
The Court of Appeal has held that where proceedings were brought against unnamed persons and interim relief was granted to restrain specified acts, a person became both a defendant and a person to whom the injunction was addressed by doing one of those acts: South Cambridgeshire District Council v Gammell [2006] 1 WLR 658, para 32.
In the case of anonymous but identifiable defendants, these procedures for service are now well established, and there is no reason to doubt their juridical basis.
One does not, however, identify an unknown person simply by referring to something that he has done in the past.
The person unknown driving vehicle registration number Y598 SPS who collided with vehicle registration number KG03 ZJZ on 26 May 2013, does not identify anyone.
It does not enable one to know whether any particular person is the one referred to.
Nor is there any specific interim relief such as an injunction which can be enforced in a way that will bring the proceedings to his attention.
The impossibility of service in such a case is due not just to the fact that the defendant cannot be found but to the fact that it is not known who the defendant is.
The problem is conceptual, and not just practical.
It is true that the publicity attending the proceedings may sometimes make it possible to speculate that the wrongdoer knows about them.
But service is an act of the court, or of the claimant acting under rules of court.
It cannot be enough that the wrongdoer himself knows who he is.
This is, in my view, a more serious problem than the courts, in their more recent decisions, have recognised.
Justice in legal proceedings must be available to both sides.
It is a fundamental principle of justice that a person cannot be made subject to the jurisdiction of the court without having such notice of the proceedings as will enable him to be heard.
The principle is perhaps self evident.
The clearest statements are to be found in the case law about the enforcement of foreign judgments at common law.
The English courts will not enforce or recognise a foreign judgment, even if it has been given by a court of competent jurisdiction, if the judgment debtor had no sufficient notice of the proceedings.
The reason is that such a judgment will have been obtained in breach of the rules of natural justice according to English notions.
In his celebrated judgment in Jacobson v Frachon (1927) 138 LT 386, 392, Atkin LJ, after referring to the principles of natural justice put the point in this way: Those principles seem to me to involve this, first of all that the court being a court of competent jurisdiction, has given notice to the litigant that they are about to proceed to determine the rights between him and the other litigant; the other is that having given him that notice, it does afford him an opportunity of substantially presenting his case before the court.
Lord Atkins principle is reflected in the statutory provisions for the recognition of foreign judgments in section 9(2)(c) of the Administration of Justice Act 1920 and section 8(1) and (2) of the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, as well as in article 45(1)(b) of the Brussels I Regulation (Recast), Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012.
It would be ironic if the English courts were to disregard in their own proceedings a principle which they regard as fundamental to natural justice as applied to the proceedings of others.
In fact, the principle is equally central to domestic litigation procedure.
Service of originating process was required by the practice of the common law courts long before statutory rules of procedure were introduced following the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875.
The first edition of the Rules of the Supreme Court, which was promulgated in 1883, required personal service unless an order was made for what was then called substituted (now alternative) service.
Subsequent editions of the rules allowed for certain other modes of service without a special order of the court, notably in the case of corporations, but every mode of service had the common object of bringing the proceedings to the attention of the defendant.
In Porter v Freudenberg [1915] 1 KB 857 a specially constituted Court of Appeal, comprising the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls and all five Lords Justices of the time, held that substituted service served the same function as personal service and therefore had to be such as could be expected to bring the proceedings to the defendants attention.
The defendants in that case were enemy aliens resident in Germany during the First World War.
Lord Reading CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 883: Once the conclusion is reached that the alien enemy can be sued, it follows that he can appear and be heard in his defence and may take all such steps as may be deemed necessary for the proper presentment of his defence.
If he is brought at the suit of a party before a court of justice he must have the right of submitting his answer to the court.
To deny him that right would be to deny him justice and would be quite contrary to the basic principles guiding the Kings courts in the administration of justice.
It followed, as he went on to observe at pp 887 888, that the court must take into account the position of the defendant the alien enemy, who is, according to the fundamental principles of English law, entitled to effective notice of the proceedings against him.
In order that substituted service may be permitted, it must be clearly shown that the plaintiff is in fact unable to effect personal service and that the writ is likely to reach the defendant or to come to his knowledge if the method of substituted service which is asked for by the plaintiff is adopted.
The principle stated in Porter v Freudenberg was incorporated in the Rules of the Supreme Court in the revision of 1962 as RSC Order 67, rule 4(3).
This provided: Substituted service of a document, in relation to which an order is made under this rule, is effected by taking such steps as the court may direct to bring the document to the notice of the person to be served.
This provision subsequently became RSC Order 65, rule 4(3), and continued to appear in subsequent iterations of the Rules until they were superseded by the Civil Procedure Rules in 1999.
The treatment of the principle in the more recent authorities is, unfortunately, neither consistent nor satisfactory.
The history may be summarised as follows: (1) Murfin v Ashbridge [1941] 1 All ER 231 arose out of a road accident caused by the alleged negligence of a driver who was identified but could not be found.
The case is authority for the proposition that while an insurer may be authorised by the policy to defend an action on behalf of his assured, he was not a party in that capacity and could not take any step in his own name.
In the course of considering that point, Goddard LJ suggested at p 235 that possibly service on the driver might have been effected by substituted service on the insurers.
Porter v Freudenberg was cited, but the point does not appear to have been argued. (2) In Gurtner v Circuit [1968] 2 QB 587, the driver alleged to have been responsible for a road accident had emigrated and could not be traced.
He was thought to have been insured, but it was impossible to identify his insurer.
The plaintiff was held not to be entitled to an order for substituted service on another insurer who had no relationship with the driver.
Lord Denning MR thought (pp 596 597) that the affidavit in support of the application was defective because it failed to state that the writ, if served on a non insurer, was likely to reach the defendant.
But he suggested that substituted service might have been effected on the real insurer if it had been identified.
Diplock LJ thought (p 605) that it might have been effected on the Motor Insurers Bureau.
Porter v Freudenberg was not cited, and the point does not appear to have been argued.
In Clarke v Vedel [1979] RTR 26, the question was fully argued by (3) reference to all the relevant authorities in the context of the Road Traffic Acts.
A person had stolen a motor cycle, collided with the plaintiffs, given a fictitious name and address and then disappeared.
He was sued under the fictitious name he had given, and an application was made for substituted service on the Motor Insurance Bureau.
The affidavit in support understandably failed to state that that mode of service could be expected to reach the driver.
The Court of Appeal proceeded on the assumption (p 32) that there was no more reason to suppose that [the writ] will come to his notice or knowledge by being served on the Motor Insurance Bureau than by being served on any one else in the wide world.
But it declined to treat the dicta in the above cases as stating the law.
Stephenson LJ considered (p 36), on the strength of the dicta in Murfin v Ashbridge and Gurtner v Circuit, that there may be cases where a defendant, who cannot be traced and, therefore, is unlikely to be reached by any form of substituted service, can nevertheless be ordered to be served at the address of insurers or the Bureau in a road accident case.
The existence of insurers and of the Bureau and of these various agreements does create a special position which enables a plaintiff to avoid the strictness of the general rule and obtain such an order for substituted service in some cases.
But he held (p 37) that This is a case in which, on the face of it, substituted service under the rule is not permissible and the affidavit supporting the application for it is insufficient.
This fictitious, or, at any rate, partly fictitious defendant cannot be served, so Mr Crowther is right in saying that he cannot be sued I do not think that Lord Denning MR or Diplock LJ or Salmon LJ or Goddard LJ had anything like the facts of this case in mind; and whatever the cases in which the exception to the general rule should be applied, in my judgment this is not one of them.
In his concurring judgment, Roskill LJ (pp 38 39) approved the statement in the then current edition of the Supreme Court Practice that [t]he steps which the court may direct in making an order for substituted service must be taken to bring the document to the notice of the person to be served, citing Porter v Freudenberg in support of it. (4) 20 years later, another division of the Court of Appeal reached the opposite conclusion in Abbey National Plc v Frost (Solicitors Indemnity Fund Ltd intervening) [1999] 1 WLR 1080.
The issue was the same, except that the defendant was a solicitor insured by the Solicitors Indemnity Fund pursuant to a scheme managed by the Law Society under the compulsory insurance provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974.
The claimant sued his solicitor, who had absconded and could not be found.
The Court of Appeal made an order for substituted service on the Fund.
Nourse LJ (with whom Henry LJ and Robert Walker LJ agreed) distinguished Porter v Freudenberg on the ground that it was based on the practice of the masters of the Supreme Court recorded in the White Book at the time; and Clarke v Vedel on the ground that the policy of the statutory solicitors indemnity rules required a right of substituted service on an absconding solicitor.
RSC Order 65, rule 4(3) was held to be purely directory and not to limit the discretion of the court as to whether or in what circumstances to order substituted service.
Nourse LJ held that RSC Order 65 did not require that the order should be likely to result in the proceedings coming to the defendants attention.
The current position is set out in Part 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules.
CPR 6.3 provides for service by the court unless the claimant elects to effect service himself.
It considerably broadens the permissible modes of service along lines recommended by Lord Woolfs reports on civil justice.
But the object of all the permitted modes of service, as his final report made clear, was the same, namely to enable the court to be satisfied that the method used either had put the recipient in a position to ascertain its contents or was reasonably likely to enable him to do so within any relevant time period: see Access to Justice, Final Report (1996), Ch 12, para 25.
CPR 6.15, which makes provision for alternative service, provides, so far as relevant: 6.15(1) Where it appears to the court that there is a good reason to authorise service by a method or at a place not otherwise permitted by this Part, the court may make an order permitting service by an alternative method or at an alternative place. (2) On an application under this rule, the court may order that steps already taken to bring the claim form to the attention of the defendant by an alternative method or at an alternative place is good service.
CPR 6.15 does not include the provision formerly at RSC Order 65, rule 4(3).
But it treats alternative service as a mode of service, which is defined in the indicative glossary appended to the Civil Procedure Rules as steps required by rules of court to bring documents used in court proceedings to a persons attention.
Moreover, sub paragraph (2) of the rule, which is in effect a form of retrospective alternative service, envisages in terms that the mode of service adopted will have had that effect.
Applying CPR 6.15 in Abela v Baadarani [2013] 1 WLR 2043 Lord Clarke of Stone cum Ebony (with whom the rest of this court agreed) held (para 37) that the whole purpose of service is to inform the defendant of the contents of the claim form and the nature of the claimants case.
The Court of Appeal appears to have had no regard to these principles in ordering alternative service of the insurer in the present case.
In my opinion, subject to any statutory provision to the contrary, it is an essential requirement for any form of alternative service that the mode of service should be such as can reasonably be expected to bring the proceedings to the attention of the defendant.
Porter v Freudenberg was not based on the niceties of practice in the masters corridor.
It gave effect to a basic principle of natural justice which had been the foundation of English litigation procedure for centuries, and still is.
So far as the Court of Appeal intended to state the law generally when it observed in Abbey National Plc v Frost that service need not be such as to bring the proceedings to the defendants attention, I consider that they were wrong.
An alternative view of that case is that that observation was intended to apply only to claims under schemes such as the solicitors compulsory insurance scheme, where it was possible to discern a statutory policy that the public should be protected against defaulting solicitors.
If so, the reasoning would apply equally to the compulsory insurance of motorists under the Road Traffic Acts, as indeed the Court of Appeal held in the present case.
That would involve a narrower exception to the principle of natural justice to which I have referred, and I do not rule out the possibility that such an exception might be required by other statutory schemes.
But I do not think that it can be justified in the case of the scheme presently before us.
In the first place, the Road Traffic Act scheme is expressly based on the principle that as a general rule there is no direct liability on the insurer, except for its liability to meet a judgment against the motorist once it has been obtained.
To that extent, Parliaments intention that the victims of negligent motorists should be compensated by the insurer is qualified.
No doubt Parliament assumed, when qualifying it in this way, that other arrangements would be made which would fill the compensation gap, as indeed they have been.
But those arrangements involve the provision of compensation not by the insurer but by the Motor Insurers Bureau.
The availability of compensation from the Bureau makes it unnecessary to suppose that some way must be found of making the insurer liable for the underlying wrong when his liability is limited by statute to satisfying judgments.
Secondly, ordinary service on the insurer would not constitute service on the driver, unless the insurer had contractual authority to accept service on the drivers behalf or to appoint solicitors to do so.
Such provisions are common in liability policies.
I am prepared to assume that the policy in this case conferred such authority on the insurer, although we have not been shown it.
But it could only have conferred authority on behalf of the policy holder (if he existed), and it is agreed that the driver of the Micra was not the policy holder.
Given its contingent liability under section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, the insurer no doubt has a sufficient interest to have itself joined to the proceedings in its own right, if it wishes to be.
That would authorise the insurer to make submissions in its own interest, including submissions to the effect that the driver was not liable.
But it would not authorise it to conduct the defence on the drivers behalf.
The driver, if sued in these proceedings, is entitled to be heard in his own right.
Thirdly, it is plain that alternative service on the insurer could not be expected to reach the driver of the Micra.
It would be tantamount to no service at all, and should not therefore have been ordered unless the circumstances were such that it would be appropriate to dispense with service altogether.
There is a power under CPR 6.16 to dispense with service of a claim form in exceptional circumstances.
It has been exercised on a number of occasions and considered on many more.
In general, these have been cases in which the claimant has sought to invoke CPR 6.16 in order to escape the consequences of some procedural mishap in the course of attempting to serve the claim form by one of the specified methods, or to confer priority on the English court over another forum for the purpose of the Brussels Regulation, or to affect the operation of a relevant limitation period.
In all of them, the defendant or his agents was in fact aware of the proceedings, generally because of a previous attempt by the claimant to serve them in a manner not authorised by the Rules.
As Mummery LJ observed, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Anderton v Clwyd County Council (No 2) [2002] 1 WLR 3174, para 58, service was dispensed with because there was no point in requiring him to go through the motions of a second attempt to complete in law what he has already achieved in fact.
In addition, I would accept that it may be appropriate to dispense with service, even where no attempt has been made to effect it in whatever manner, if the defendant has deliberately evaded service and cannot be reached by way of alternative service under CPR 6.15.
This would include cases where the defendant is unidentifiable but has concealed his identity in order to evade service.
However, a person cannot be said to evade service unless, at a minimum, he actually knows that proceedings have been or are likely to be brought against him.
A court would have to be satisfied of that before it could dispense with service on that basis.
An inference to that effect may be easier to draw in the case of hit and run drivers, because by statute drivers involved in road accidents causing personal injury or damage to another vehicle must either stop and, if required to do so by any person having reasonable grounds for so requiring, give his name and address and also the name and address of the owner and the identification marks of the vehicle, or else report the incident later.
But the mere fact of breach of this duty will not necessarily be enough, for the driver may be unaware of his duty or of the personal injury or damage or of his potential liability.
No submission was made to us that we should treat this as a case of evasion of service, and there are no findings which would enable us to do so.
I would not wish arbitrarily to limit the discretion which CPR 6.16 confers on the court, but I find it hard to envisage any circumstances in which it could be right to dispense with service of the claim form in circumstances where there was no reason to believe that the defendant was aware that proceedings had been or were likely to be brought.
That would expose him to a default judgment without having had the opportunity to be heard or otherwise to defend his interests.
It is no answer to this difficulty to say that the defendant has no reason to care because the insurer is bound to satisfy a judgment against him.
If, like the driver of the Micra, the motorist was not insured under the policy, he will be liable to indemnify the insurer under section 151(8) of the Road Traffic Act.
It must be inherently improbable that he will ever be found or, if found, will be worth pursuing.
But the court cannot deny him an opportunity to be heard simply because it thinks it inherently improbable that he would take advantage of it.
I conclude that a person, such as the driver of the Micra in the present case, who is not just anonymous but cannot be identified with any particular person, cannot be sued under a pseudonym or description, unless the circumstances are such that the service of the claim form can be effected or properly dispensed with.
The European law issue
Mr Williams QC, who appeared for Ms Cameron, submitted that this result was inconsistent with the Sixth Motor Insurance Directive 2009/103/EC, and that the Road Traffic Act 1988 should be read down so as to conform with it.
The submission was pressed with much elaboration, but it really boils down to two points.
First, Mr Williams submits that the Directive requires a direct right against the insurer on the drivers underlying liability, and not simply a requirement to have the insurer satisfy a judgment against the driver.
Secondly, he submits that recourse to the Motor Insurers Bureau is not treated by the Directive as an adequate substitute.
Neither point appears to have been raised before the Court of Appeal, for there is no trace of them in the judgments.
Before us, they emerged as Mr Williams main arguments.
I propose, however, to deal with them quite shortly, because I think it clear that no point on the Directive arises.
Article 3 of the Directive requires member states to ensure that civil liability in respect of the use of vehicles is covered by insurance, and article 9 lays down minimum amounts to be insured.
Recital 30 states: The right to invoke the insurance contract and to claim against the insurance undertaking directly is of great importance for the protection of victims of motor vehicle accidents In order to facilitate an efficient and speedy settlement of claims and to avoid as far as possible costly legal proceedings, a right of direct action against the insurance undertaking covering the person responsible against civil liability should be extended to victims of any motor vehicle accident.
Effect is given to this objective by article 18, which provides: Article 18 Direct Right of Action Member states shall ensure that any party injured as a result of an accident caused by a vehicle covered by insurance as referred to in article 3 enjoys a direct right of action against the insurance undertaking covering the person responsible against civil liability.
I assume (without deciding) that article 18 requires a direct right of action against the insurer in respect of the underlying wrong of the person responsible and not just a liability to satisfy judgments entered against that person.
It is a plausible construction in the light of the recital and the reference to Directive 2000/26/EC.
However, Ms Cameron is not trying in these proceedings to assert a direct right against the insurer for the underlying wrong.
Her claim against the insurer is for a declaration that it is liable to meet any judgment against the driver of the Micra.
Her claim against the driver is for damages.
But the right that she asserts against him on this appeal is a right to sue him without identifying him or observing rules of court designed to ensure that he is aware of the proceedings.
Nothing in the Directive requires the United Kingdom to recognise a right of that kind.
Indeed, it is questionable whether it would be consistent with article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights regarding the fairness of legal proceedings.
Mr Williams second point is in reality a reiteration of the first.
It is based on article 10 of the Directive, which requires member states to ensure that there is a national bureau charged to pay compensation for damage to property or personal injuries caused by an unidentified vehicle or a vehicle for which the insurance obligation provided for in article 3 has not been satisfied.
The submission is that the Directive requires that recourse to the Bureau, as the relevant body in the United Kingdom, should be unnecessary in a case like this, because the Micra was identified.
It was only the driver who was unidentified.
This is in effect a complaint that the indemnity available from the Motor Insurers Bureau under the Untraced Drivers Agreement, which extends to untraced drivers whether or not the vehicle is identified, is wider than the Directive requires.
In reality, the complaint is not about the extent of the Bureaus coverage, which unquestionably extends to this case.
The complaint is that it is the Bureau which is involved and not the insurer.
But that is because the insurer is liable only to satisfy judgments, which is Mr Williams first point.
It is true that the measure of the Bureaus indemnity is slightly smaller than that of the insurer (because of the excess for property damage and the limited provision for costs).
But in that respect it is consistent with the Directive.
Disposal
I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and reinstate that of District Judge Wright.
","On 26 May 2013, the respondent, Ms Bianca Cameron, was injured when her car collided with a Nissan Micra.
It is not in dispute that the incident was due to the negligence of the driver of the Micra.
The registration number of the Micra was recorded, but the driver made off without stopping or reporting the accident to the police and has not been heard of since.
Mr Naveed Hussain, the registered keeper, was not the driver and has declined to identify the driver.
He has been convicted of failing to disclose the drivers identity.
The car was insured under a policy issued by the appellant, Liverpool Victoria Insurance Co Ltd, to a Mr Nissar Bahadur, whom the company believes to be a fictitious person.
Neither Mr Hussain nor the driver was insured under the policy to drive the car.
Ms Cameron initially sued Mr Hussain for damages.
The proceedings were amended to add a claim against Liverpool Victoria Insurance for a declaration that it would be liable to meet any judgment against him.
The insurer served a defence, denying liability on the ground that there was no right to obtain a judgment against him as there was no evidence that he was the driver.
Ms Cameron then applied to amend her claim form and particulars of claim.
She sought to substitute for Mr Hussain, as defendant, the person unknown driving vehicle registration number Y598 SPS who collided with vehicle registration number KG03 ZJZ on 26 May 2013.
District Judge Wright dismissed that application and entered summary judgment for the insurer.
HHJ Parker dismissed Ms Camerons appeal.
On further appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by a majority (Gloster and Lloyd Jones LJJ, Sir Ross Cranston dissenting).
The majority considered that the court had a discretion to permit an unknown person to be sued whenever justice required it and that an alternative right of claim against the Motor Insurance Bureau (MIB) was irrelevant.
Sir Ross Cranston would have dismissed the appeal in light of the alternative right to an MIB claim.
Liverpool Victoria Insurance appealed to the Supreme Court in relation to two issues: (1) the power to issue or amend the claim form and (2) the compatibility of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (the 1988 Act) with the Sixth Motor Insurance Directive (2009/103/EC).
The Supreme Court allows the appeal.
The Court of Appeals order is set aside and that of District Judge Wright is reinstated.
Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment, with which all the Justices agree.
Part VI of the Road Traffic Act 1988 applies in this appeal.
Section 145 requires there to be an insurance policy against third party risks in relation to the use of the vehicle by the particular driver, while section 151(5) requires the insurer to satisfy any judgment falling within section 151(2), subject to
certain conditions.
Under section 151(2)(b), an insurer who has issued a policy in relation to the use of a vehicle is liable on a judgment, even where it was obtained against an uninsured driver. [3] The MIB has entered into agreements with the Secretary of State to compensate third party victims of road accidents not even covered by section 151(2)(b).
This means victims suffering personal injury or property damage caused by (1) uninsured vehicles and (2) drivers who cannot be traced.
Clause 4(d) of the 2003 Untraced Drivers Agreement (the 2003 Agreement) is applicable in Ms Camerons case. [4] It is a fundamental feature of the statutory scheme of compulsory insurance in the UK that it does not confer on victims a direct right of recovery against an insurer for the underlying liability of the driver.
The only direct right against the insurer is the right to require it to satisfy a judgment against the driver, under section 151, once the drivers liability has been established in legal proceedings.
Consistent with this approach, the 2003 Agreement assumes that judgment cannot be obtained against the driver if he cannot be identified, and therefore the only recourse is against the MIB, not the insurer. [5, 22] The general rule remains that proceedings may not be brought against unnamed parties, as is implicit in the limited exceptions contemplated by the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) [9].
The main exceptions are: (1) possession actions against trespassers, (2) actions and orders where some of the wrongdoers were known so they could be sued both personally and as representing their unidentified associates and (3) the wider jurisdiction recognised in Bloomsbury Publishing Group Plc v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2003] 1 WLR 1633 (Ch) [10].
The key distinction is between two classes of unnamed defendant cases: (1) anonymous defendants who are identifiable but whose names are unknown and (2) defendants, such as in most hit and run drivers, who are not only anonymous but cannot even be identified.
In category (1), defendants are described in such a way that it is at least possible to locate or communicate with them, and to determine whether they are the person described in the claim form.
In category (2), this is not possible. [13] This appeal is not directly concerned with service it is about the issue or amendment of the claim form but the legitimacy of issuing or amending can be tested against the possibility of service [14].
An identifiable but anonymous defendant can be served, if necessary by CPR r.6.15 alternative service [15].
Interim injunction cases can fall in category (1), because the process of enforcing the injunction will sometimes be enough to bring the proceedings to the defendants attention, as in Bloomsbury [15].
However, an unknown person is not identified simply by referring to past actions [16].
Proceedings against such a person (in category (2)) offend the fundamental principle of justice that a person cannot be made subject to the jurisdiction of the court without having such notice of the proceedings as will enable a fair hearing [17 18].
While CPR r.6.15 permits alternative service, the mode of service should be such as can reasonably be expected to bring the proceedings to the defendants attention [20 21].
Applying these principles to the present appeal, alternative service against an unidentifiable person referred to in the proceedings only by a pseudonym or description cannot be justified.
In particular, ordinary service on the insurer would not constitute service on the driver, and alternative service could not be expected to reach the driver of the Micra.
Nor would it be appropriate to dispense with service under CPR r.6.16 in a case where it could not be shown that the defendant knew of the proceedings. [21 26] As to the EU law issue on the Sixth Motor Insurance Directive, the Supreme Court considers no point on the Directive arises because: (1) Ms Cameron is not trying to assert a direct right against the insurer for the underlying wrong (her claim is for damages from the driver) and (2) it is consistent with the Directive to require a claim against the MIB, not the insurer, in this class of case [27 30].
"
uksc-2012-0025,"The appellant is a limited partnership formed by Mr Alistair Erskine and his wife as a vehicle for entering into a commercial contract with the respondents.
These proceedings were brought by the appellant on the basis that it was induced to enter into the contract by a misrepresentation which was fraudulent or in any event negligent.
The appellant sought the reduction of the contract and damages.
After proof the Lord Ordinary, Lord Hodge, found that Mr Erskine was the directing mind of the appellant, and that he had decided to enter into the contract in reliance upon a negligent misrepresentation contained in an email sent to him some weeks before the appellant was formed.
The allegation of fraud was found not to have been established: [2010] CSOH 62.
The latter point has not been pursued further.
Nor has the present appeal concerned the question whether the remedy of reduction may be available.
The issue with which we are concerned is whether the appellant was induced to enter into the contract by a negligent misrepresentation and, if so, is in principle entitled to recover damages.
The Lord Ordinary focused upon the legal situation as at the time when the email in question was sent.
He approached the case as one where A (the appellant, through Mr Erskine acting as its agent) had relied upon a representation made by B (the respondents) to C (Mr Erskine acting as an individual), and where the question was whether B had owed a duty of care to A at the time when the representation was made to C.
Applying the principles set out in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605, the Lord Ordinary held that the appellant could not recover damages because it had not been in existence at the time when the email was sent.
Although the respondents had owed a duty of care to Mr Erskine, no such duty could in his view have been owed at that time to the appellant, since a non existent entity could not hold any right or be owed any duty.
Both parties appealed against the Lord Ordinarys decision.
Before the Inner House, it was conceded on behalf of the respondents that the Lord Ordinary had erred in considering that the non existence of the appellant at the time when the email was sent was necessarily an insuperable obstacle to the existence of a duty of care: it was accepted that in appropriate circumstances a duty of care could be owed to a class of persons, some of whom might not then be in existence.
In the present case however, it was submitted, at the time when the email was sent there was no one other than Mr Erskine whose reliance upon it could reasonably have been foreseen.
In those circumstances, there had therefore been no proximity between the appellant and the respondents.
It followed, applying Caparo, that no duty of care had been owed by the respondents to the appellant.
Those submissions were accepted by the Second Division: [2011] CSIH 81; 2012 SC 240.
Their discussion of the case again proceeded on the assumption that the relevant question was whether, at the time when the email was sent to Mr Erskine, the respondents had owed a duty of care to the appellant.
Their Lordships did not address the respondents cross appeal, which challenged the Lord Ordinarys finding that a duty of care had been owed to Mr Erskine.
In the present appeal, the issues were identified by the parties as being, first, whether, on the assumption that the respondents owed a duty of care in negligence to Mr Erskine, such a duty of care was owed to the appellant; and secondly, whether the assumption upon which the first issue proceeded was correct.
The case was again approached as one where A had relied upon a representation made by B to C, and where the relevant question was whether B had owed a duty of care to A.
It was again assumed that that question had to be answered as at the time when the email was sent to Mr Erskine.
The authorities relied upon were again Caparo and more recent English and Commonwealth authorities in which the Caparo principles were applied.
The question focused in the printed cases, put shortly, was whether the Caparo principles could be regarded as satisfied as at the time when the email was sent, on the basis that the appellant was the alter ego of Mr Erskine, and the contract between the appellant and the respondents was the same as the contract which the respondents had had in contemplation when they made the statement to Mr Erskine.
There is however a question as to whether the basis upon which the case has been approached by the courts below, and by the parties in their printed cases, is correct.
Is this truly a case in which A relied upon a representation made by B to C? Was the representation made only at the time when the email was sent? Or is this a case where, as was argued before the Lord Ordinary, there was a continuing representation, which was capable of remaining in effect until a contract was concluded? If so, in the circumstances of this case, was the contract concluded between the parties on the basis of a continuing representation made by the respondents to the appellant? If so, did the respondents assume a responsibility towards the appellant for the accuracy of the representation?
If these questions are answered affirmatively, then the case is not concerned with the circumstances in which a third party may sue in damages for economic loss suffered as a result of relying upon a representation of which it was not the addressee, but with the recovery of damages where a party to a contract was induced to enter into it by a negligent misrepresentation made to it by the other party to the contract.
In Scots law, that involves a consideration of section 10 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 (the 1985 Act) and of the authorities in which that provision has been discussed.
The questions which I have posed in para 5, and the area of the law which I have mentioned in para 6, were not discussed by the courts below or by the parties in their printed cases, but were raised during the hearing of the present appeal.
Counsel for the respondents accepted that there would be no unfairness in the courts considering these matters; and, in the circumstances, the parties were permitted to make additional submissions in writing.
Before addressing these matters, it is necessary first to consider the relevant facts as found by the Lord Ordinary.
The relevant facts
The respondents are the owners of a grouse moor at Castle Grant, near Grantown on Spey, over which commercial shooting takes place.
Recognising that there required to be substantial investment in the moor in order to increase the number of grouse, and being unwilling to undertake that investment themselves, they sought to attract a tenant.
The matter was taken forward by their employee and chief executive, Mr Sandy Lewis, and by a chartered surveyor, Mr Jonathan Kennedy, who was engaged to advise them.
In May 2006 Mr Erskine learned that a lease of the moor might be available, and entered into discussions with Mr Kennedy.
He was sent the proposed terms of a lease.
He did not however pursue his interest.
The respondents then entered into discussions with another prospective tenant, Mr Paddy McNally.
In the course of those discussions, Mr McNally expressed concern about possible over shooting of the moor during the 2006 season.
In order to reassure Mr McNally that the respondents had considered the capacity of the moor to bear the shooting planned for that season, Mr Lewis sent his adviser an email dated 4 August 2006, in which he gave information about the grouse counts carried out on the moor earlier that year and the estimated grouse population of the moor, extrapolated from the counts.
The areas of the moor in which the counts were carried out were not however representative of the moor as a whole, but were the parts of the moor which were considered to be the most heavily populated by grouse.
As a result, the estimated grouse population, as stated in the email, was well in excess of the actual population.
In the event, Mr McNally decided not to proceed with the transaction.
On Mr McNallys withdrawal, Mr Kennedy contacted Mr Erskine in early September 2006 in order to pursue the possibility of his taking a lease of the moor.
After taking part in a shoot and making a further visit to the moor, Mr Erskine became concerned that the shooting planned for that season would leave an inadequate breeding population on the moor.
He expressed his concern in an email to Mr Kennedy, in which he said that he was not qualified to quantify the damage which the shooting was doing to the grouse stocks but thought that it was not insignificant.
Mr Kennedy forwarded the email to Mr Lewis, stating in his covering message that there was no doubt in his mind that the estate had been overshot, and that this had undoubtedly had an effect on the letting of the moor and might have made it impossible.
Mr Lewis replied by email on 29 September, stating: I have sent a separate email re the grouse programme which you may wish to pass on to Alastair Erskine.
The separate email sent by Mr Lewis to Mr Kennedy, which I will refer to as the critical email, did not form part of the chain of messages initiated by Mr Erskines email, and did not have the appearance of responding to any concern expressed about over shooting.
Its subject was Grouse Bags, and it began by stating: Now that we are well through with the grouse season, I thought it may be appropriate to recap on how we set this years programme for Castle Grant and where we are to date.
The following information was provided to you at the beginning of August.
Mr Lewis then repeated the information which had originally been sent in the email of 4 August 2006.
The email concluded: I am very happy for you to pass this on to Alastair Erskine if you feel this would be helpful to him.
On 2 October 2006 Mr Kennedy forwarded the critical email to Mr Erskine, as Mr Lewis had suggested.
Mr Erskine decided to proceed with the transaction, and instructed his solicitors, Anderson Strathern, to conclude the lease in the name of a limited liability partnership.
On 10 October Anderson Strathern informed the respondents that Mr Erskine intended to use a new limited liability partnership to take the tenancy.
Discussions continued between Mr Erskine and Mr Lewis, who was aware of Mr Erskines intention to incorporate the appellant as a vehicle for the lease.
The appellant was incorporated on 16 November 2006.
The lease was signed on various dates between 8 December 2006 and 18 January 2007.
Mr Erskine subsequently discovered that the counting areas were not representative of the moor as a whole, that the grouse population was smaller than he had believed, and that it would in consequence take longer for the population to recover to the point where shooting could take place at the level which he had intended.
He considered that Mr Lewis had deliberately misled him in the critical email in order to induce him to take on the lease, and brought the present proceedings on that basis.
The Lord Ordinary accepted that the critical email contained a material misrepresentation, namely an implicit representation that the counts were representative of the population of grouse on the moor.
He found that Mr Lewis had acted honestly but negligently.
He had had no basis for making the representation and did not check his facts before doing so.
He had been aware of Mr Erskines concern that there had been overshooting, and of the importance to an incoming tenant of an adequate population on which to build.
The Lord Ordinary stated (paras 104 105): The purpose of the representation was to give reassurance to Mr Kennedy and Mr Erskine that the 2006 shooting programme was justified and that it would leave a substantial surplus of birds on the moor, in order to maintain Mr Erskines interest in entering into the lease The managers of the estate had, or would be perceived to have, access to a much more detailed knowledge of the quality of their moor than any other party.
In response to expressed concerns about the 2006 shooting programme and the availability of a sufficient end of season surplus, Mr Lewis chose to provide reassurance in his representations.
The Lord Ordinary also accepted that the representation had induced Mr Erskine to choose to enter into the lease.
Was the representation of a continuing nature?
The law relating to the effect of representations upon a contract proceeds on the basis that a representation made in the course of pre contractual discussions may produce a misapprehension in the mind of the other party which continues so as to have a causative effect at the time when the contract is concluded.
It is on that basis that a misrepresentation may lead to the setting aside of the contract as being vitiated by error or fraud.
The capacity of a representation to have a continuing effect was noted by Lord Cranworth, when rejecting what he described as a very desperate argument that a representation could not justify the setting aside of a bond because it was made some time before the bond was executed, in Smith v Kay (1859) 7 HL Cas 750, 769: It is a continuing representation.
The representation does not end for ever when the representation is once made; it continues on.
The pleader who drew the bill, or the young man himself, in stating his case, would say, Before I executed the bond I had been led to believe, and I therefore continued to believe .
A similar explanation can be found in the judgment of Lord Wright MR in With v OFlanagan [1936] Ch 575, which was another action for the rescission of a contract.
Under reference both to English authorities concerned with the law of contract, and to a Scottish authority concerned with the law of reparation (the case of Brownlie v Miller (1880) 7 R (HL) 66; Brownlie v Campbell (1880) 5 App Cas 925, which I shall discuss shortly), his Lordship observed at p 584 that a representation made as a matter of inducement to enter into a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation, and added at pp 584 585: This question only occurs when there is an interval of time between the time when the representation is made and when it is acted upon by the party to whom it was made, who either concludes the contract or does some similar decisive act; but the representation remains in effect and it is because that is so, and because the court is satisfied in a proper case on the facts that it remained operative in the mind of the representee, that the court holds that under such circumstances the representee should not be bound.
The law relating to reparation for harm suffered as a result of the conclusion of a contract in reliance upon a misrepresentation made in the course of pre contractual discussions proceeds in this respect upon the same basis.
As Smith J observed in the Australian case of Jones v Dumbrell [1981] VR 199, 203: When a man makes a representation with the object of inducing another to enter into a contract with him, that other will ordinarily understand the representor, by his conduct in continuing the negotiations and concluding the contract, to be asserting, throughout, that the facts remain as they were initially represented to be.
And the representor will ordinarily be well aware that his representation is still operating in this way, or at least will continue to desire that it shall do so.
Commonly, therefore, an inducing representation is a continuing representation, in reality and not merely by construction of law.
As Smith J indicated by his use of the words ordinarily and commonly, whether a representation should be treated as continuing depends upon the facts of the individual case (see also Macquarie Generation v Peabody Resources Ltd [2000] NSWCA 361, paras 3 22, per Mason P).
Where a misrepresentation does not have a continuing effect, for example because it is withdrawn or lapses, or because the other party discovers the true state of affairs before the contract is concluded, it cannot induce the other party to enter into the contract and therefore cannot affect its validity or give rise to a remedy in damages for any loss resulting from its conclusion.
As Lord Brougham observed in Irvine v Kirkpatrick (1850) 7 Bell App (HL) 186, 237 238, in order that the misrepresentation may be of any avail whatever, it must inure to the date of the contract.
If the other party discovers the truth before he signs the contract, the misrepresentation and the concealment go for just absolutely nothing.
Whether the remedy sought is reduction of the contract or damages for the loss suffered as a result of entering into it, in either case a representation may therefore be treated by the law as having a continuing effect, rather than as being an event whose legal consequences are necessarily fixed at the time when the statement in question was made.
The continuing effect of a pre contractual representation is reflected in a continuing responsibility of the representor for its accuracy.
Thus a person who subsequently discovers the falsity of facts which he has innocently misrepresented may be liable in damages if he fails to disclose the inaccuracy of his earlier representation: Brownlie v Miller (1880) 7 R (HL) 66, 79; Brownlie v Campbell (1880) 5 App Cas 925, 950 per Lord Blackburn.
The same continuing responsibility can be seen in the treatment of representations which are true when made, but which become false by the time the contract is entered into: see, for example, Shankland & Co v Robinson & Co 1920 SC (HL) 103, 111 per Lord Dunedin.
The law is thus capable, in appropriate circumstances, of imposing a continuing responsibility upon the maker of a pre contractual representation in situations where there is an interval of time between the making of the representation and the conclusion of a contract in reliance upon it, on the basis that, where the representation has a continuing effect, the representor has a continuing responsibility in respect of its accuracy.
In the present case, the representation contained in the critical email was undoubtedly of a continuing nature so long as Mr Erskine remained the prospective contracting party.
The question then arises whether, in the circumstances of this case, the representation continued after the identity of the prospective contracting party changed, and, if so, whether the respondents assumed a responsibility towards the appellant for the accuracy of the representation.
Did the representation, and responsibility for its accuracy, continue after the identity of the contracting party changed?
In principle, the possibility that a representation may continue to be asserted, and may have a causative effect so as to induce the conclusion of the contract, is not necessarily excluded where, as in the present case, the contracting parties are not the original representor and representee.
In such a case, it is possible that the inference can be drawn from the parties conduct that they proceeded with the negotiation and conclusion of the contract on the basis that the accuracy of the representation continued to be asserted by the representor, implicitly if not expressly, after the identity of the prospective contracting party had changed.
In such circumstances the representation may have continued to have a causative effect, so as to induce the conclusion of the contract.
Where the inference to be drawn is that a representation continued to be made until the contract was concluded, it may also be inferred that the risk of harm being suffered as a result of reliance upon it, in the event that it was inaccurate, continued to be foreseeable.
In such circumstances, the representor may be taken to have assumed responsibility for the accuracy of the representation towards the contracting party who relied upon it, even though that person was not the original representee.
No authority has been cited in which the court has considered the liability of a contracting party for a representation inducing the conclusion of the contract by someone other than the original representee.
The decision of the House of Lords in Briess v Woolley [1954] AC 333 is however relevant.
The case concerned a fraudulent misrepresentation made in the course of pre contractual discussions by a shareholder in a company.
He was subsequently authorised by the other shareholders to continue the negotiations as their agent, and in due course a contract was concluded.
The shareholders were held liable in damages to the other contracting party, notwithstanding that the representation had been made by the shareholder before he began to negotiate on their behalf.
Lord Reid stated at p 349: The misrepresentations were continuing representations intended to induce the other party to make the contract, and when that party made the contract to his detriment, a cause of action arose, and in my opinion it arose against both the agent and the principal.
The agent continued to be fraudulent after he was appointed.
It was his duty, having made false representations, to correct them before the other party acted on them to his detriment, but he continued to conceal the true facts.
Lord Tucker added at p 354: the duty of the agent, who has made the misrepresentation, to correct it cannot be regarded as only a personal obligation.
If he has in the meantime been appointed agent with authority to make representations for the purpose of inducing a contract he, in his capacity as agent, is by his conduct repeating the representations previously made by him.
The same principle should also apply in the converse situation, where the representation is made to (rather than by) the agent prior to the commencement of his agency.
In such a situation, depending of course on the facts, the representor can equally be taken to be, by his conduct, implicitly repeating the representation previously made, and can therefore owe a duty in respect of the accuracy of the representation towards the agents principal.
The case of Briess v Woolley concerned a misrepresentation which was fraudulent rather than negligent; and it preceded the case of Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465.
Once it is accepted that a negligent misrepresentation can give rise to a remedy in damages, however, there is no reason why the approach adopted in Briess should not apply to negligent as well as to fraudulent misrepresentations which are made in order to induce the representee to enter into a contract.
A negligent misrepresentation is equally capable of having a continuing effect up until the time when the contract is concluded, where the person by whom the representation is made, or to whom it is addressed, becomes the agent of the person by whom the contract is concluded.
In the present case, the change in the identity of the prospective contracting party did not affect the continuing nature of the representation, or the respondents continuing responsibility for its accuracy.
It appears from the Lord Ordinarys findings that the negotiations which had been under way between Mr Erskine and the respondents, in the course of which the critical email was sent, simply continued after it had become apparent that a limited liability partnership was to be used as a vehicle for Mr Erskines investment.
Neither party drew a line under the previous discussions, after the appellant was formed, in order to begin afresh.
Neither party disclaimed what had previously been said in the course of their discussions, or sought assurances that it could be relied upon as between the appellant and the respondents.
The seeking of such an assurance would no doubt have appeared to those involved to be an unnecessary formality.
As the Lord Ordinary found, the representation made in the critical email remained operative in the mind of Mr Erskine after he began to act in the capacity of an agent of the appellant, up until the time when the lease was executed on behalf of the appellant.
The appellant was thus induced to enter into the contract by that representation.
In continuing and concluding the contractual negotiations with the appellant, through its agent Mr Erskine, without having withdrawn the representation earlier made to Mr Erskine as an individual, the respondents by their conduct implicitly asserted to the appellant the accuracy of that representation; and they did so in a situation where it continued to be foreseeable that the representation would induce the other party to the negotiations to enter into a contract.
They therefore assumed a responsibility towards the appellant for the accuracy of the representation.
They therefore owed the appellant a duty of care, which they failed to fulfil.
The recovery of damages where a party to a contract was induced to enter into it
by a negligent misrepresentation
The law in Scotland governing the recovery of damages, where a party to a contract was induced to enter into it by a negligent misrepresentation made by or on behalf of another party to the contract, involves a consideration of section 10 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 and of the authorities in which that provision has been discussed.
Following the decision of the House of Lords in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465, the Scottish courts accepted the general principle that damages could be recovered for economic loss suffered as a result of reliance upon a negligent misrepresentation, where the relationship between the person making the representation and the person relying upon it was of a kind which gave rise to a duty of care.
The salient feature of that case, and of later analogous cases such as Smith v Eric S Bush [1990] 1 AC 831, which gave rise to such a duty, was identified by Lord Bridge of Harwich in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605, 620 621: The salient feature of all these cases is that the defendant giving advice or information was fully aware of the nature of the transaction which the plaintiff had in contemplation, knew that the advice or information would be communicated to him directly or indirectly and knew that it was very likely that the plaintiff would rely on that advice or information in deciding whether or not to engage in the transaction in contemplation.
In these circumstances the defendant could clearly be expected, subject always to the effect of any disclaimer of responsibility, specifically to anticipate that the plaintiff would rely on the advice or information given by the defendant for the very purpose for which he did in the event rely on it.
So also the plaintiff, subject again to the effect of any disclaimer, would in that situation reasonably suppose that he was entitled to rely on the advice or information communicated to him for the very purpose for which he required it.
Where a representation is made by one person to another in relation to the subject matter of a contract which they are contemplating entering into, the circumstances may plainly be of the kind described by Lord Bridge.
Nevertheless, in a number of decisions at first instance, the Scottish courts treated such cases as an exception to the principle established by Hedley Byrne, on the basis that the doctrine of precedent required them to follow the decision of the Inner House in Manners v Whitehead (1898) 1 F 171.
It had been held in that case, in the words of the headnote, that A person who is induced to enter into a contract by misrepresentations is not entitled to damages from the person making the representations, unless they are fraudulent.
The decision reflected the view of the law then prevailing both in Scotland and in England (see Le Lievre v Gould [1893] 1 QB 491): a view from which the House of Lords departed in Hedley Byrne.
This exception to the Hedley Byrne principle was illogical and unjust.
It resulted in a situation where it was accepted that A could sue B where Bs negligent misrepresentation induced A to enter into a contract with C, provided there was a special relationship between A and B, but not where it induced A to enter into a contract with B himself (see, for example, Twomax Ltd v Dickson, McFarlane & Robinson 1982 SC 113).
The Scottish Law Commission responded by recommending legislative reform.
Its Report on Negligent Misrepresentation (Scot Law Com No 92, 1985) contained a draft Bill, which was enacted as section 10 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985.
Section 10(1) provides: A party to a contract who has been induced to enter into it by negligent misrepresentation made by or on behalf of another party to the contract shall not be disentitled, by reason only that the misrepresentation is not fraudulent, from recovering damages from the other party in respect of any loss or damage he has suffered as a result of the misrepresentation; and any rule of law that such damages cannot be recovered unless fraud is proved shall cease to have effect.
Section 10(1) is drafted in a negative form.
It does not provide that a party to a contract who has been induced to enter into it by negligent misrepresentation made by or on behalf of another party to the contract is entitled to recover damages: it provides that such a person shall not be disentitled by reason only that the misrepresentation is not fraudulent, and that any rule of law that such damages cannot be recovered unless fraud is proved shall cease to have effect.
Whether such a person is entitled to damages therefore depends on the common law, modified by section 10(1) only to the extent that recovery is not excluded by reason of the absence of fraud.
The consequence is that entitlement to damages depends upon establishing the breach of a duty of care, since at common law it is the breach of a duty of care which renders a negligent misrepresentation wrongful.
This approach reflects the Commissions identification of the mischief in the existing law as being the rule in Manners v Whitehead, as it was described: that is to say, the requirement to establish fraud.
It considered, and rejected, the possibility that the Scottish legislation should be modelled upon section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967: a complex provision which has the effect of dispensing with the need to establish a duty of care in English law where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party to the contract, and as a result has suffered loss.
The Commission considered that, in Scotland, the common law should continue to govern the question whether the circumstances were such as to give rise to a duty of care (para 3.2).
The Commission noted that the relationship between parties in pre contractual discussions was one where the proximity between them, and the foreseeability of reliance upon representations, were particularly apparent (para 2.3), but considered that the existence of a duty of care should continue to be governed by the common law (para 3.2).
There are indeed a variety of circumstances in which a duty of care might be absent: for example, where the representation was accompanied by an effective disclaimer of responsibility, or where the representation was subject to a time limit which had lapsed, or where reliance upon the representation was not reasonably foreseeable, or where the parties by their contract effectively excluded liability for negligent pre contractual representations, or where the contract itself governs the subject matter of the representation.
Section 10(1) does not therefore impose a statutory liability for careless misrepresentations which have induced a party to enter into a contract, but removes the barrier which previously existed to the recovery of damages where a party had been induced to enter into a contract by a misrepresentation made in breach of a duty of care.
This point does not emerge altogether clearly from the two authorities in which section 10(1) has been considered.
In the first, Hamilton v Allied Domecq plc 2001 SC 829, the Lord Ordinary, Lord Carloway, was not assisted by the fact that he was not referred to any Scottish authorities on the subject of negligent misrepresentation but was instead referred to section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967.
His Lordship stated at para 17 that, as a result of section 10(1) of the 1985 Act, there was no need to enter into the field of Hedley Byrne type special relationships and whether a duty of care was owed: the statute provided the remedy, and its practical effect was that one contracting party had a duty to the other not to make negligent misrepresentations which induced the other to contract.
That approach was followed by Lord Glennie in BSA International SA v Irvine [2010] CSOH 78.
He stated at para 15 that, as a result of the section, it was enough to found a claim for damages that the representation was negligent: there was no need to import into the relationship of intending contractual parties concepts that had developed in the law of tort and delict to identify other situations in which a party might owe a duty of care to another as regards the accuracy of statements made by him.
Lord Glennie added at para 16 that the issue was likely to be almost entirely academic, since the criteria for the imposition of a duty of care would invariably be satisfied when the misstatement was an operative misrepresentation, in the sense in which that expression had been used by Prof J M Thomson in his article, Misrepresentation, 2001 SLT 279: that is to say, an inaccurate statement of fact made in pre contractual discussions which induced the misrepresentee to enter into the contract and which would have induced a reasonable person to do so.
I sympathise with the view that this issue will often be academic, for the reason given by Prof Thomson and adopted by Lord Glennie.
The law does not impose a general duty of care in the conduct of contractual negotiations, reflecting the fact that each party is entitled, within the limits set by the law, to pursue its own interests.
As the Supreme Court of Canada has observed, the prospect of causing deprivation by economic loss is implicit in the negotiating environment (Martel Building Ltd v Canada [2000] 2 SCR 860, para 51).
It is also possible that a contract entered into between the parties may limit or exclude the scope for finding a duty of care in respect of pre contractual representations.
Nevertheless, it has long been accepted that the relationship between the parties to contractual negotiations may give rise to such a duty in respect of representations which the representor can reasonably foresee are likely to induce the other party to enter into the contract, unless circumstances negativing the existence of such a duty, such as those mentioned in para 38, are present.
It is therefore unnecessary in most cases to go back to the fundamental principles governing the existence of a duty of care, as set out in the tripartite test adopted in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605, or to undertake an assessment of whether a special relationship existed.
Questions as to the circumstances in which the relationship between parties negotiating a contract gives rise to a duty of care in respect of representations inducing the contract are not now of such a novel character as normally to require consideration from first principles.
As I have explained, however, that does not mean that liability will necessarily exist where a party to a contract has been induced to enter into it by a negligent misrepresentation made by or on behalf of another party to the contract.
Since section 10(1) does not create a statutory liability, the question whether the misrepresentation was made in breach of a duty of care still has to be answered, even if the answer may sometimes be obvious.
In the present case, it is plain, on the Lord Ordinarys findings of fact, that a duty of care was owed by the respondents to Mr Erskine in respect of the representation contained in the critical email.
For the reasons I have explained, a duty of care was also owed by the respondents to the appellant, when they negotiated and concluded the contract on the basis of the discussions previously held with Mr Erskine.
The respondents acted in breach of that duty of care, and are therefore liable in damages for any loss suffered by the appellant as a result.
The case will therefore have to return to the Court of Session for further procedure.
Conclusion
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal.
LORD TOULSON
I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of Lord Reed.
I add my own shorter judgment because the case is in some respects novel.
However, its solution requires no new principle.
Once properly identified, the application of the relevant principles becomes straightforward, but they were perhaps obscured rather than illuminated by the way in which the case was presented below.
The claim was for the reduction (ie setting aside) of the lease entered into between the claimant Cramaso, acting through the agency of Mr Erskine, as lessee, and the respondent trustees, as lessor, and for repayment of Cramasos associated expenses.
Cramaso was created by Mr Erskine for the purpose of taking the lease, and he was its controller or, as the Lord Ordinary described him, its directing mind.
The ground of Cramasos claim was that it had been induced to enter into the lease by a misrepresentation made either fraudulently or negligently by an agent of the trustees to Mr Erskine.
The representation was made before Cramasos creation.
The Lord Ordinary found that Mr Erskine had been induced to enter into the lease on behalf of Cramaso by a misrepresentation.
He rejected the allegation that the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently, but he found that it had been made negligently.
However, he granted absolvitor (ie dismissed the proceedings) on the ground that Cramaso had not come into the picture at the time when the misrepresentation was made to Mr Erskine.
For that reason he concluded that (a) no duty of care was owed by the trustees to Cramaso at the time when the misrepresentation was made, and (b) Cramaso therefore had no cause of action against the trustees and no right to reduction of the lease.
I part company with the Lord Ordinary, and the Second Division which upheld his judgment, at stage (b).
In the courts below attention was concentrated on the legal position at the time of the representation, and this was regarded as decisive.
In this court Mr Dewar QC refocused the argument in response to questions and comments from the bench.
He switched from focusing on the time of the misrepresentation, and the question whether at that time the trustees duty of care might be defined so as to encompass a category of affected persons capable of including Cramaso on its later formation, to the different issue whether the absence of a duty of care owed to Cramaso at the time of the misrepresentation was fatal to its claim on the facts as found by the Lord Ordinary.
The change of tack took Mr Sandison QC by surprise, but he fairly and properly accepted that there was no injustice in the court addressing the issue.
Logically the first issue to consider is the challenge made by the trustees to the Lord Ordinarys finding that there was a negligent misrepresentation to Mr Erskine.
The question was essentially one of fact on which the Lord Ordinary was entitled to find as he did.
However, Mr Sandison did raise one point of law.
He submitted that it was necessary for Cramaso to show that at the time of Mr Lewiss email dated 29 September 2006 to Mr Kennedy he knew or ought to have known that there was a high degree of probability that Mr Erskine would be sent the email and would rely upon it.
Mr Sandison based that submission on passages in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 from the speeches of Lord Bridge at pp 620 621, Lord Oliver at p 638 and Lord Jauncey at pp 660 661.
The submission is ill founded.
In Caparo the court was considering the familiar situation in which it is alleged that D, the defendant, was negligent in a statement made to C, the claimant, upon which C relied in entering into a transaction with T, a third party.
It is readily understandable that in that type of situation cogent grounds are needed to explain why D ought to have had C in his contemplation as somebody entitled to rely on Ds statement when considering whether to enter into a transaction with T.
The situation where a statement is made during contractual negotiations by one prospective contracting party to another is quite different.
Here, the statement made by Mr Lewis was intended for the attention of Mr Erskine in relation to the very transaction about which they were negotiating.
Since Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon [1976] QB 801, 820, it has been established that the principle in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 is capable of applying to pre contractual representations.
Lord Denning MR stated the principle as follows: if a man, who has or professes to have special knowledge or skill, makes a representation by virtue thereof to another be it advice, information or opinion with the intention of inducing him to enter into a contract with him, he is under a duty to use reasonable care to see that the representation is correct, and that the advice, information or opinion is reliable.
If he negligently gives unsound advice or misleading information or expresses an erroneous opinion, and thereby induces the other side to enter into a contract with him, he is liable in damages.
This is not necessarily an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which a duty of care may arise in connection with a statement made in a pre contractual context.
However, where the principle in Esso v Marden applies, there is no need for a court to go into issues of the kind discussed in Caparo and the various other authorities relied on by Mr Sandison, including Smith v Eric S Bush [1990] 1 AC 831, White v Jones [1995] 2 AC 207, Al Saudi Banque v Clark Pixley [1990] Ch 313 and Customs & Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc [2007] 1 AC 181.
Those were all cases where C claimed to have entered into a transaction with T in reliance on a representation by D and the courts wrestled with the problem how to determine whether D owed C a duty of care in relation to that transaction.
In particular, the courts struggled with the question how the putative duty was to be defined so as to avoid, in Cardozo CJs memorable expression in Ultramares Corporation v Touche (1931) 174 NE 441, 444 liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.
No comparable problem arises in considering whether the trustees owed a duty of care to Mr Erskine when making a representation to him about the grouse moor which they were hoping that he would lease.
Even, if Mr Sandisons primary submission on the Caparo point were right, it would in any event be immaterial what Mr Lewis may have considered to be the degree of probability that Mr Kennedy would pass on his email to Mr Erskine, since Mr Lewis invited Mr Kennedy to consider passing it on, which Mr Kennedy unsurprisingly did.
It was marketing information provided by the trustees, through Mr Lewis, to their agent with a view to its being used in the lease negotiations.
I turn to the point on which Cramasos claim foundered in the courts below.
The issue is whether it is fatal to Cramasos claim that the negligent misrepresentation was made before Cramaso was formed or even mentioned.
The formation of Cramaso made no difference to the subject matter of the negotiations or to the people involved in conducting them.
What changed was the role of Mr Erskine.
From being himself the prospective lessee, he became the agent of a company created and controlled by him for the purpose of taking the lease.
The question which arises in these circumstances is whether the earlier misrepresentation is to be regarded as water under the bridge, a matter about which Cramaso could have no cause for complaint albeit that its factual effect was to induce Mr Erskine to go ahead with the transaction which was concluded by the execution of the lease, or whether the misrepresentation is to be regarded as having continued up to the time of the execution of the lease so as to entitle Cramaso to complain of it.
As a matter of general principle, a representation made during contractual negotiations for the purpose of inducing a contract will ordinarily be regarded as continuing until the contract is actually concluded because it will generally be reasonable for the representee to continue to rely on it.
There may be exceptions, for example where there has been a material change of circumstances which would make the representation irrelevant, but I can see no reason to depart from the general principle in the present case.
It is unnecessary for me to refer to all the authorities to which Lord Reed has drawn attention.
However, Briess v Woolley [1954] AC 333 is particularly relevant to the present case because of the part played at the time of the representation by a person who became the agent of one of the parties after the representation was made but before the contract was made.
The plaintiffs entered into a contract to buy the shares of company X as a result of a fraudulent representation by R, who was Xs managing director.
At the time of making the false representation R had no authority to negotiate a sale of the shares.
He was subsequently authorised by Xs shareholders to act on their behalf in the matter.
The plaintiffs sued the sellers.
The plaintiffs won at first instance, lost in the Court of Appeal but won in the House of Lords.
They lost in the Court of Appeal because it was held, at [1953] 2 QB 218, 222, that the misrepresentation had been made once and for all before R became the sellers agent for the purposes of the sale.
The Court of Appeal also held that there was no ratification of Rs earlier conduct.
Its conclusion on the latter point was upheld by the House of Lords, but the appeal succeeded on the basis that the false representation was to be regarded as a continuing representation.
Mr Gerald Gardiner QC on behalf of the plaintiffs presented a simple argument.
He submitted at p 335: If one effects a sale by ones agent, who signs the contract, one cannot ratify the contract and take the money payable under it while at the same time disclaiming the way in which the contract was brought about.
Cramasos argument in the present case is essentially the same, namely that the trustees cannot disclaim the way in which the contract was brought about by their agent.
Mr Gardiners submission was echoed in the speech of Lord Reid at p 349.
He rejected: the contention that a principal can disclaim responsibility for fraudulent misrepresentations made by his agent which, although made before the agency commenced, to the agents knowledge continued to influence the other party after his appointment as agent and finally induced the other party to enter into the contract which the agent had been authorised to make and did make on behalf of his principal.
The misrepresentations were continuing representations intended to induce the other party to make the contract, and when that party made the contract to his detriment, a cause of action arose, and in my opinion it arose against both the agent and the principal.
Lord Tucker at pp 353 354 approved the statement of the trial judge that the law regarded the representations as continuing during the whole period between the time the representations were made and the time when they were finally acted upon.
He said: It was contended by counsel for the respondents that when once the representations were made the wrongful act was complete although no action for damages would lie until the representee suffered damage.
He argued that the representations were not continuing but the consequences of the original representation continued, and accordingly, provided that the representor was not the agent of the respondents when the original representation was made, they could not be held responsible because the consequences of that representation took effect at a time when the representor had become their agent.
No authority for this proposition was cited, and it is, in my view, founded upon error.
The tort of fraudulent misrepresentation is not complete when the misrepresentation is made.
It becomes complete when the misrepresentation not having been corrected in the meantime is acted upon by the representee.
Damage giving rise to a claim for damages may not follow or may not result until a later date, but once the misrepresentation is acted upon by the representee the tortious act is complete provided that the representation is false at that date.
If false when made but true when acted upon there is no misrepresentation.
In Spencer Bower on Actionable Misrepresentation, 2nd ed, p 77, article 73, it is stated: It is commonly said that the representation must be shown to have been false when made.
But this is not quite correct.
The only real issue is was it true or false when it was acted upon? In Halsburys Laws of England, 2nd ed, vol XX111, p 29, para 44, it is stated: Where there is an appreciable interval between the two dates above mentioned [ie date when made and date when acted upon], and the representation relates to an existing state of things, the representor is deemed to be repeating his representation at every successive moment during the interval, unless he withdraws or modifies it by timely notice to the representee in the meantime.
I do not think the accuracy of these statements can be challenged.
It is true that there does not appear to be any express authority which can be quoted as an example of the application of this principle to a case of principal and agent where the agency commences after the making of a representation which is allowed by the agent to continue uncorrected with knowledge of its falsity until acted upon.
I agree, however, with Barry J, that the duty of the agent, who has made the misrepresentation, to correct it cannot be regarded as only a personal obligation.
If he has in the meantime been appointed agent with authority to make representations for the purpose of inducing a contract he, in his capacity as agent, is by his conduct repeating the representations previously made by him.
Although that was a case of a fraudulent misrepresentation, I cannot see that it makes a difference to the continuing nature of the representation whether it was fraudulent or negligent.
It is, of course, true that a negligent misrepresentor is unlikely to be aware that he has been negligent, whereas the maker of a deliberately false statement will know what he has done.
However, that does not affect the general proposition stated in Halsburys Laws which Lord Tucker cited with approval, and it is logical that it should not do so.
What matters is the continuing potency of the representation as an inducing factor.
The potency and duration of a representation do not depend on the honesty or dishonesty of its maker.
In Briess v Woolley R was the representor, whereas in the present case Mr Erskine was the representee.
But I do not see why that distinction should make any difference to the principle.
The proper conclusion is that the representation was a continuing representation, which operated as an inducing factor on the mind of Mr Erskine after he became Cramasos agent, and Cramaso was entitled to rely on it, just as Cramaso (on the authority of Briess v Woolley) would have carried responsibility for the ongoing effect of a prior misrepresentation by Mr Erskine to the trustees.
On that reasoning I would hold that the decisions of the lower courts were wrong.
","Lord Reed begins by questioning whether the way the case has been approached by the courts below and in the parties printed cases is correct [5 7].
Instead of viewing the representation as an event whose legal consequences were fixed at the time when the statement was made, Lord Reed concludes that the case in fact concerns a continuing representation capable of remaining in effect until the contract is concluded [31].
The representation contained in the critical email was undoubtedly of a continuing nature so long as Mr Erskine remained the prospective contracting party [24].
In principle, the possibility that a representation may continue to be asserted, and may have a causative effect so as to induce the conclusion of a contract, is not necessarily excluded where, as here, the contracting parties are not the original representor and representee.
The inference can be drawn from the parties conduct that they proceeded with the negotiation and conclusion of the contract on the basis that the accuracy of the representation continued to be asserted by the representor, implicitly if not expressly, after the identity of the prospective contracting party had changed.
In such circumstances, the representation could continue to have a causative effect, so as to induce the conclusion of the contract [25].
Where the inference to be drawn is that a representation continued to be made until the contract was concluded, it may also be inferred that the risk of harm being suffered as a result of reliance upon it, in the event that it was inaccurate, continued to be foreseeable.
In such circumstances, the representor may be taken to have assumed responsibility for the accuracy of the representation towards the contracting party who relied upon it, even where he is not the original representee [26].
Just as a representation may continue up to conclusion of the contract when made by a companys agent prior to the commencement of his agency, it may have the same effect where the person to whom it is addressed becomes the agent of the contracting party [27 28].
In this case, the negotiations simply continued after it became apparent that an LLP was to be used as the vehicle for Mr Erskines investment.
Neither party drew a line under the previous discussions, disclaimed what had previously been said or sought assurance that it could be relied upon as between the contracting parties [30].
In continuing and concluding the contractual negotiations with Cramaso, through its agent Mr Erskine, without having withdrawn the representation earlier made to him as an individual, the respondents by their conduct implicitly asserted to Cramaso the accuracy of that representation.
It continued to be foreseeable that the representation would induce the other party to the negotiations to enter into a contract.
The respondents therefore assumed a responsibility towards Cramaso for the accuracy of the representation and owed it a duty of care, which they failed to fulfil [31].
Cramaso is entitled to recover damages for any loss suffered as a result, under section 10 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 [32 43].
In a concurring judgment, Lord Toulson rejects the respondents argument that it was necessary for Cramaso to show that, at the time of the critical email, Mr Lewis knew or ought to have known that there was a high degree of probability that Mr Erskine would be sent the email and would rely upon it.
The situation where a statement is made by one party to another, who in turn relies upon it in entering a contract with a third party is different to the present situation, where a statement was made during contractual negotiations by one prospective party to another in relation to the very transaction about which they were negotiating [51].
Lord Toulson agrees with Lord Reed that the fact the representation was negligent rather than fraudulent does not affect its continuing nature; what matters is its continuing potency as an inducing factor [63].
The case will have to return to the Court of Session for further procedure in relation to remedies [44].
