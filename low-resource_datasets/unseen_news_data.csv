The space agency, working alongside the local authorities had secured the area and retrieved the debris for further analysis, as per a CBS report. As of the last update, there had been no report of casualties.

According to the KSA, the object is a metallic ring roughly eight feet in diameter that crashed into Mukuku village in the Makueni county. ""Preliminary assessments indicate that the fallen object is a separation ring from a launch vehicle,"" the agency said.

Notably, a separation ring is a part of a spacecraft and since rockets typically come in stages, each part drops away when it has fulfilled its role in the launch of the vehicle.

""We want to assure the public that the object poses no immediate threat to safety,"" the KSA said.

""Our experts will analyze the object, use existing frameworks to identify the owner, and keep the public informed of the next steps and outcomes.""

The incident might be isolated in the sense it has taken place for the first time in Kenya but in the last few years, the menace of space debris has started to affect people on Earth. Last year, NASA was slapped with a lawsuit by an American family when a piece of falling metal pierced their Florida home.

Chinese officials say that hydropower projects in Tibet will not have a major impact on the environment or on downstream water supplies but India and Bangladesh have nevertheless raised concerns about the dam.

During the PM’s visit, the Indian government had said that the green diamond “reflects the chemical and optical properties of earth-mined diamonds” and that it “embodies eco-friendliness” as it was crafted using sustainable resources “like solar and wind power.

Calling the diamond a ‘beacon of responsible luxury’, the government had said it ‘symbolises India’s 75 years of freedom and commitment to sustainable international relations’.

Regarding Biden’s gift, the Indian government had said that it was a meticulously handcrafted sandalwood box, with ‘das danam’; (10 donations). Created by a master craftsman from Jaipur, the sandalwood box featured intricately carved flora and fauna patterns. The sandalwood was sourced from Mysore.

What happened?

The Tesla Cybertruck driven by Livelsberger exploded outside the Las Vegas hotel owned by US President-elect Donald Trump, killing the Army soldier and injuring seven others on Thursday.

Inside the Cybertruck were fireworks, gas tanks, and camping fuel, which were connected to a detonation system controlled by the driver, according to CNN.

Who was Matthew Livelsberger?

Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners, the US Army said in a statement.

He had served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo.

, opens new tab reported its first fall in yearly deliveries on Thursday as lucrative year-end incentives for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker's aging lineup and the new Cybertruck pickup failed to lure customers wary of high borrowing costs.
Musk had earlier predicted ""slight growth"" in 2024 deliveries and offered a range of promotions including interest-free financing and free fast-charging to boost sales.
But reduced European subsidies, a shift in the United States toward lower-priced hybrid vehicles and tougher competition especially from China's BYD (002594.SZ)
, opens new tab hurt Tesla.
The U.S. EV maker's shares closed about 6% lower.
""Lower deliveries reduces Tesla's growth and lowers the total addressable market for the company's ancillary services, including autonomous driving software, charging, and insurance,"" Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said in a note.
""The slight decline highlights that the current vehicle lineup is nearing market saturation,"" he added.
As demand for EVs slows, Musk has pivoted his focus on building a self-driving taxi business that is expected to boost Tesla's value.
He also backed President-elect Donald Trump with millions of dollars in campaign donations and analysts expect easier regulations from the new administration to help Tesla in the long run.
But with self-driving technology still under development and years away from commercialization, analysts have said Tesla would have to rely on its promised cheaper versions of current cars and the success of Cybertruck to achieve Musk's target of 20% to 30% sales growth in 2025.
The truck, known for its futuristic design, has been showing signs of weakness in demand.
Tesla is yet to disclose the delivery numbers for its Cybertruck. The company said on Thursday it handed over 471,930 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and 23,640 units of other models, including the Model S sedan, Cybertruck and Model X premium SUV.
Overall, Tesla delivered 495,570 vehicles in the three months to Dec. 31, missing estimates of 503,269 units, according to 15 analysts polled by LSEG. It produced 459,445 vehicles in the period, down about 7% from a year earlier. Deliveries for 2024 totaled 1.79 million, 1.1% lower than the prior year and below estimates of 1.806 million units, according to 19 analysts polled by LSEG.
Tesla's 2024 deliveries were ahead of BYD, which reported a 12.1% rise in sales of battery-electric vehicles to 1.76 million in 2024, thanks to competitive prices and a stronger push into Asian and European markets.
In China, its second-largest market, Tesla bucked its global trend with record-high sales of more than 657,000 cars, up 8.8% from 2023, as it extended discounts to entice consumers in the world's largest auto market. 
TRUMP BET
Tesla shares are coming off a strong 2024, in which they rose more than 60% after Trump's election with strong support from Musk.
Musk has said he plans to leverage his promised role as a government-efficiency czar under the Trump administration to advocate for a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles to replace the current state-specific laws, which he described as ""incredibly painful"" to navigate.
Tesla's Autopilot and ""Full Self-Driving"" technologies, which are not yet fully autonomous, have been under scrutiny due to lawsuits, U.S. traffic safety regulator probe and a Department of Justice criminal investigation.
Tesla is also under pressure from legacy automakers. Its October registrations in Europe fell 24%, due to a tight race from Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE)

""What was interesting is that their sell-through also declined in the year, even though people know that there's a tax credit elimination coming potentially in 2025,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.
""That didn't seem to accelerate anything, that may be telling.""","Elon Musk-led Tesla reported first full-year drop in sales in its history as a public company. Tesla deliveries for 2024 were 1.79 million, 1.1% lower than a year ago.

The explosion occurred right outside the front gate of the hotel, killing one person and injuring at least seven.

The New York Post reported that Livelsberger rented the pickup truck in Colorado. He drove up and down Las Vegas before stopping outside the hotel.

The FBI is investigating whether there is a link between the Las Vegas explosion and the New Orleans rampage in which a truck ran over a crowd before opening fire and killing 15 people. The suspect in the New Orleans incident, 42-year-old Shamsud Din-Jabbar, is also a US Army veteran who served in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010.

Police released video evidence showing charred gasoline canisters and firework mortars in the bed of the burned cybertruck. 

Meanwhile, Tesla founder Elon Musk claimed the explosion outside the Trump hotel was an ""act of terrorism"". He said the electric vehicle's design minimised the blast's impact, sparing the hotel from significant damage.

The top-level resignations, in a way, started with the exit of co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Ankit Bhati in 2019 and reached a crescendo with Chatterjee's departure. In the last couple of months, however, at least 500 employees, each earning over Rs 50 lakh/annum, have resigned.

Ola Group has no chief people officer since N Balachandar quit, people aware of the matter told NDTV Profit. It does not have a company secretary either. The company's head of product strategy and service head have moved on. The head of sourcing is on his notice period while the vice president of production has been asked to go on garden leave.

Individuals aside, entire teams are getting laid off , including those involved in engineering programme management, product planning and customer quality assurance.

Shares of Ola Electric closed 3.68% lower at Rs 90.09 apiece on the BSE, compared to a 0.3% advance in the benchmark Sensex.","Ola Electric Chief Marketing Officer Anshul Khandelwal and Chief Technology & Product Officer Suvonil Chatterjee have resigned from their roles, with effect from December 27.

6m3caecn-1,"Osamu Suzuki, former chairman of Japan's Suzuki Motor, has died, the company announced Friday. He was 94 years old. Suzuki led the company for more than 40 years, until he stepped down as chairman in 2021, transforming the Shizuoka-based company into a global automaker.

Born Osamu Matsuda on January 30, 1930, in Gero, Gifu Prefecture, Japan, Suzuki was the fourth son in a farming family. While his early aspirations leaned toward politics, his career trajectory took a dramatic turn when he married into the Suzuki family, joining the automaker that would come to define his legacy.

Suzuki's journey began with humble roots. While pursuing a law degree at Chuo University in Tokyo, he worked as a junior high school teacher and night guard to support himself. After graduating in 1953, he initially worked at a bank before his marriage brought him into the Suzuki family business. This pivotal moment marked the start of a career that would span over six decades.
Taking over as president in 1978, Suzuki led the company through a period of significant expansion. He leveraged Suzuki Motor’s expertise in minicars and motorcycles to carve out a unique niche in the global market. Under his leadership, the company forged strategic alliances with General Motors and Volkswagen, enabling Suzuki to enter the competitive North American and European markets. In India, his focus on affordable, small vehicles positioned the company as a market leader, a status it retains today.

Suzuki’s vision for India was particularly impactful. RC Bhargava, Chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, expressed deep sorrow at his passing, saying, “Without his vision and foresight, his willingness to take a risk that no one else was willing to take, his deep and abiding love for India, and his immense capabilities as a teacher, I believe the Indian automobile industry could not have become the powerhouse that it has become. Millions of us in this country are living better lives because of Osamu San.”

Bhargava also highlighted Suzuki’s influence on Indo-Japanese relations, noting, “He won and enjoyed the trust of several Prime Ministers. He had a very close understanding with the present Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Osamu San’s contribution to the Indian economy, and for building bridges between India and Japan, was acknowledged by the conferment of the Padma Bhushan on him.” 
Suzuki’s leadership philosophy was characterised by decisiveness and a relentless drive to keep moving forward. “If I were to listen to everybody, it would make things too slow,” he wrote in his 2009 memoir, I’m a Small-Business Boss. “Never stop, or else you lose.” This approach earned him the distinction of being the longest-serving head of a global automaker, with more than 28 years as president across two terms.
Even after stepping down as president in 2000, Suzuki remained deeply involved in the company’s operations, assuming the roles of chairman and CEO. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, he returned as president at the age of 78 to address the company’s first profit decline in eight years. Reflecting on his decision, he wrote, “In the face of an extremely difficult business environment, I have to stand at the forefront. In the past 30 years, a sense of complacency has spread throughout the company. As the one who brought the company to where it is, I have to correct this and lead the company until the economy improves.”

Despite his many achievements, Suzuki’s tenure was not without challenges. In 2016, Suzuki Motor admitted to using unapproved methods for testing vehicle fuel efficiency in Japan, sparking a scandal that led to a sharp decline in the company’s stock and management changes. Suzuki publicly apologised, acknowledging the company’s “top-down culture” that discouraged junior employees from voicing concerns. He stepped down as CEO, accepted a 40% pay cut, and continued as chairman until 2021.

At his retirement, Suzuki expressed satisfaction with the company’s management and assured stakeholders of his ongoing availability for advice. “I’m full of life,” he remarked, highlighting his continued vitality by sharing that he had played golf 47 times the previous year.

Osamu Suzuki passed away on December 25, 2024, at the age of 94, succumbing to lymphoma. He is survived by his wife and three children.","Osamu Suzuki, who led Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor for several decades, passed away at the age of 94 due to lymphoma, the Japan-based automaker said. Osamu, who had served as Suzuki Motor's CEO and Chairman, was the longest-serving head of the company. Born as Osamu Matsuda, he is known for introducing the Maruti 800 in India."

bx8akpke-1,"Brazilian authorities have rescued 163 workers from conditions similar to ""slavery"" at a construction site for a factory of Chinese electric vehicle company Build Your Dreams (BYD) in Camacari, Bahia.
The workers, employed by the outsourced company Jinjiang Group, faced degrading living and working conditions, including inadequate lodging, poor sanitation, and withheld wages.
The site and accommodations have been shut down until compliance is ensured, the Public Labour Prosecutor's Office (MPT) said.
In a statement issued on Monday, MPT said, ""The rescue of 163 workers who were being held in conditions analogous to slavery and the closure of the lodgings and parts of the construction site of the plant where the car manufacturer Build Your Dreams (BYD) is installing a factory in the municipality of Camacari, in the metropolitan region of Salvador, was communicated on Monday morning to the company and to Jinjiang Group, one of the contractors hired to carry out the work. The rescued workers will remain in the lodgings, but will not be able to work and will have their employment contracts terminated.""
""The embargoed accommodations and construction sites will also remain inactive until they are fully regularised with the agencies that make up the task force,"" the statement added.
During the series of inspections, which began in mid-November and will continue over the next few days, 163 workers were identified in conditions analogous to slavery at the outsourced company Jinjang, a service provider for BYD.
""These workers were distributed across four main lodgings, two located on Rua Colorado and two on Rua Umbus, in the municipality of Camacari. A fifth lodging, intended for workers in administrative roles, was also inspected, but despite identifying some irregularities, no workers were rescued,"" the MPT said.

It further said, ""The conditions found in the lodgings revealed an alarming picture of precariousness and degradation. In the first lodging on Colorado Street, the workers slept on beds without mattresses and had no lockers for their personal belongings, which were mixed in with food supplies. The sanitary situation was especially critical, with only one bathroom for every 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 am to form a line and be ready to leave for work at 5:30 am.""
All the accommodations shared serious infrastructure and hygiene problems. The bathrooms, in addition to being insufficient, were not separated by sex, did not have adequate toilet seats and presented poor hygiene conditions.
The situation in some of the food courts was equally precarious. The kitchens operated in alarming conditions, with no adequate cupboards for food storage.
The MPT added, ""The conditions at the construction site also revealed serious irregularities. The cafeteria at the workplace used coolers to serve meals, without ensuring minimum hygiene conditions. The chemical toilets, only eight for approximately 600 workers, were in a deplorable state, without toilet paper, water or adequate maintenance, in addition to not respecting the minimum distances established by regulation.""
The workers were also exposed to intense solar radiation, showing visible signs of skin damage.
In addition to the degrading conditions, the situation constituted forced labour, due to several indicators found during the inspections. ""The workers were required to pay a deposit, had 60 per cent of their wages withheld (receiving only 40 per cent in Chinese currency), faced excessive costs for terminating their contracts, and had their passports withheld by the company. Early termination of the contract implied the loss of the deposit and the amounts withheld, in addition to the obligation to pay for the return ticket and reimburse the cost of the outward ticket,"" the MPT said.
BYD was established in February 1995, headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, with its business spanning four major industries -- automobile, rail transit, renewable energy, and electronics.","About 163 workers were rescued from ""slave-like"" conditions at construction site for factory of China's BYD.

gaw2iyxl-1,"Stellantis has reportedly reversed its decision to lay off about 1,100 employees at its Ohio Jeep plant. The shift in the decision comes after the resignation of CEO Carlos Tavares. Employees are said to return to work after the new year. Stellantis has now reportedly decided to issue a worker adjustment notice instead, which will allow employees to return to their jobs. As per a report of Reuters, Stellantis has changed its decision about laying off around 1,100 workers at a Jeep factory in Ohio. The development came after the unexpected resignation of CEO Carlos Tavares. According to reports, the board was not pleased with Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares due to his tough goals for sales and cost reductions, as well as his relationships with the company's suppliers, dealers, and unions. Last month, Stellantis has revealed its intention to lay off its employees at the Toledo South Assembly Plant, where the Jeep Gladiator is produced. The decision was a part of their strategy to enhance efficiency and lower the amount of unsold stock in their North American operations. The layoffs were supposed to start on January 5, but now they have been put on hold for an indefinite period. Instead of job cuts, Stellantis is said to provide a notice for worker adjustment, and employees will be able to come back to work as expected after the New Year. Previously, Stellantis announced that 400 employees at an automotive parts plant in Detroit would lose their jobs for an indefinite period. In August, the company stated that it would be laying off as many as 2,450 employees at a factory in Michigan due to the discontinuation of production for the Ram 1500 Classic truck. UAW President Shawn Fain has reportedly warned of a potential nationwide strike at various facilities, claiming that Stellantis has not fulfilled the commitments it made to the union. As the company has decreased its salaried workforce through voluntary buyouts, the job losses affecting manufacturing workers who are part of the United Auto Workers union have drawn attention from politicians.","Stellantis has reversed its decision to lay off about 1,100 employees at an Ohio Jeep plant less than three weeks after the abrupt resignation of chief executive officer Carlos Tavares, the Franco-Italian automaker said late on Saturday.

gue0h5uk-1,"Imagine a future where your electric vehicle is not just powered by electricity but by the very sunlight that hits its surface. Well, if all goes well with the ground-breaking technology by Mercedes Benz, this could soon become a reality.
Mercedes-Benz Develops Solar Paint for Electric Vehicles, Turning Every Inch into an Energy Source

The company is currently working on a technology to apply solar paint to electric vehicles (EVs), which would turn every inch of its exterior into an energy-harvesting machine, whether parked or driving!

The paint is made of a thin, flexible photovoltaic material that weighs only 50 grams per square meter and is just 5 micrometres thick. Mercedes envisions that an average midsize SUV could harvest enough energy to travel up to 7,456 miles annually under ideal conditions, though the actual amount will depend on sunlight exposure.

This solar paint, unlike traditional solar panels, can bend around the curves of a car which would offer more coverage than rigid glass panels. The paint is part of a multi-layer coating, including a solar-active material, insulation, and a top layer resembling a butterfly’s wing, which is highly translucent and filled with nanoparticles. This allows for different car colours while still enabling sunlight absorption.

The energy harvested would be directed to the EV’s battery, and in some sunny areas like Los Angeles, it could cover the entire daily driving distance.

Mercedes’ Eco-Friendly Solar Paint for EVs Aims to Address Charging Concerns and Boost Consumer Adoption

This solar paint, unlike the conventional solar panels, won’t use rare earth metals or toxic materials, making it more environmentally friendly and easier to recycle. It would also address common EV charging concerns, reducing reliance on charging networks and home installations. Mercedes hopes this technology will boost consumer acceptance of EVs.

Though still in development, the company is confident it will eventually make solar paint a cost-effective and viable option for EVs, enhancing their appeal and functionality.","Mercedes-Benz is developing solar paint for electric vehicles (EVs) that turns the car's exterior into an energy source.

The Delhi High Court on Friday cleared the way for the Serious Fraud Investigation Office to continue its investigation against Hero Electric Vehicles Pvt., over a purported FAME-II EV subsidy fraud.

During the last hearing on Dec. 4, the high court had granted Hero Electric a chance to settle with the Union Ministry of Heavy Industries on or before Dec. 12.

Today, the high court was informed that the settlement talks between Hero Electric and the ministry have failed and that the government has rejected the settlement proposal put forth by the company.

On Dec. 2, NDTV Profit reported that India’s Serious Fraud Investigation Office had conducted search operations at the premises of Hero Electric, Okinawa Autotech and Benling India over FAME-II violations. 

These cases arose from the fraudulent availing of EV subsidy amounting to Rs 297 crore. Of this, Rs 133.5 crore was claimed by Hero Electric alone. 

The SFIO investigation has revealed that several restricted parts under the phased manufacturing programme were either directly or indirectly imported from China, in violation of the FAME-II guidelines.

The scheme of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase-II was launched in 2019 and ran until March 2024 to promote electric and hybrid vehicles, in what is now the world’s third largest automotive market. It stipulated manufacturing of some key components in India, for the vehicle to be eligible for subsidy.","Delhi High Court has allowed the Serious Fraud Investigation Office to continue its investigation against Hero Electric Vehicles in an alleged FAME-II EV subsidy fraud.

yzenwptk-1,"Rural poverty in India saw a significant decline in 2023-24, with the poverty ratio falling below 5 per cent for the first time, according to an analysis by SBI Research. The sharp increase in rural spending contributed to this reduction, bringing the rural poverty rate down to 4.86 per cent from 7.2 per cent in the previous year, and from 25.7 per cent in 2011-12, as per the latest SBI report.


In urban areas, the decline in poverty was more gradual, with the poverty rate standing at 4.09 per cent in FY24, down from 4.6 per cent the previous year.

""It is possible that these numbers may be subject to slight revisions once the 2021 census is completed and updated rural-urban population data is released. We anticipate that urban poverty could decline further. At a national level, we estimate poverty rates in India are now between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent, with extreme poverty nearly eliminated,"" stated SBI Research.

The report noted that improvements in physical infrastructure were boosting urban mobility, helping to narrow the gap between rural and urban areas while reducing rural income inequality. Additionally, the growing impact of government schemes, such as Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), has played a key role in closing the rural-urban divide.

“Around 30 per cent of the Rural MPCE is explained by factors that are endogenous to the rural ecosystem. Such endogenous factors are mostly due to the initiatives the government has taken in terms of DBT transfers, building Rural infrastructures, augmenting farmer’s income, improving the rural livelihood significantly,” it said.

MPCS, or monthly per-capita consumer expenditure, is a key indicator used to assess the economic level of a family.

The rural-urban consumption gap decreased to 69.7 per cent in 2023-24, down from 71.2 per cent in the previous year and 83.9 per cent a decade ago.

The report also highlighted that changes in food item consumption, despite their declining share in overall spending, had a notable impact on overall consumption. Higher inflation led to a reduction in consumption across all sectors, with the effect being more pronounced in rural areas, particularly in low-income states.

On the other hand, middle-income states were primarily responsible for sustaining consumption demand.

India's inflation remained above 5 per cent in November, prompting the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to keep interest rates unchanged in its December meeting for the eleventh consecutive time. The MPC is set to meet again in February.

According to the SBI report, even with the new CPI basket, inflation would have remained at 5 per cent, compared to an estimated 5.5 per cent under the old series.","Rural poverty in India dipped below 5% for the first time to stand at an estimated 4.86% in FY24, according to a report by SBI Research. The decline from 7.2% in FY23 was driven by higher consumption growth and significant government support. Urban poverty also declined to 4.09% in FY24 from 4.6% in FY23."

If the deal goes through, Minimalist would have seen its valuation increase from around Rs 630 crore (about $75 million) to Rs 3,000 crore ($350 million) in a span of about three years, largely on the back of increasing revenues and a stable profit profile. It will also be one of the largest deals in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) space in recent years, especially in the skincare industry.

In FY24, Minimalist generated a revenue of Rs 350 crore, an increase of 89 percent from Rs 184 crore clocked in FY23. During the same period, it also saw its profit more than double from Rs 5 crore to Rs 11 crore. Minimalist has been profitable for at least four years, data showed.

As things stand currently, Minimalist is commanding a revenue multiple of about 10X, significantly higher than 4-6X that similar direct-to-consumer (D2C) startups get during similar deals, thanks to its financial discipline.

The inspection, which took approximately three hours on New Year's Eve, saw uniformed officers board the yacht with their equipment. Meanwhile, a stewardess guided them through the vessel during the search.

A source revealed that the customs search was simply “routine.” Interestingly, Jeff Bezos was nowhere to be found on Koru during the turmoil. Despite the officers' presence, the guests' mood seemed largely undisturbed. At one point, however, a stewardess was spotted in conversation with Lauren Sánchez, likely briefing her on the situation.

Sánchez seemed unconcerned, enjoying the company of friends, including her ex-boyfriend, Tony Gonzalez with whom she shares a 23-year-old son, Nikko. The former NFL star, looking remarkably fit, even took a refreshing dip in the ocean while the search was underway.

Jeff Bezos' party in Aspen

The sunny yacht day followed a snowy celebration for Lauren Sánchez and Jeff Bezos, 60, in Aspen, Colorado, where their winter getaway sparked wedding rumors. Whispers of a lavish $600 million New Year’s Eve wedding made the rounds, but Bezos was quick to shoot down the speculation with a firm denial on X.

“This whole thing is completely false — none of this is happening,” Bezos wrote on X. “The old adage ‘don’t believe everything you read’ is even more true today than it ever has been. Now lies can get ALL the way around the world before the truth can get its pants on,” he continued, adding, “So be careful out there folks and don’t be gullible.”

Trump’s oldest daughter Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner also joined the fun as they were spotted holding hands while exiting Matsuhisa, a sushi hotspot rumoured to be tied to the supposed wedding plans. Meanwhile, Yellowstone star Kevin Costner made an appearance at Bezos’ Aspen party, fresh from sharing drinks with Jennifer Lopez at Kemo Sabe. The high-profile gatherings kept the holiday season anything but quiet.","Amazon Founder and the world's second-richest man Jeff Bezos' $500 million yacht 'Koru' was raided by customs officers in a surprise search that lasted three hours on New Year's Eve.

b9re4kjq-1,"The NPCI has removed the user limit for onboarding on WhatsApp Pay, granting the platform the ability to provide UPI services to its entire user base in India.

    Previous Restrictions: WhatsApp Pay’s UPI user base was capped at one million in 2020, later raised to 100 million by 2022.
    Reason for Cap: The restrictions were imposed to ensure a phased rollout and prevent banking infrastructure overload.

With the UPI ecosystem now stabilized, NPCI has decided to lift the cap entirely. WhatsApp Pay will continue adhering to UPI guidelines and circulars for Third-Party Application Providers (TPAPs).
Broader UPI Context

The NPCI, under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), oversees UPI—a critical retail payment framework in India.

Recent updates in the UPI landscape include:

    Market Share Caps Delayed:
        The central government has postponed the enforcement of market share caps for UPI transactions to December 2026.
        This delay provides relief to dominant players like PhonePe (47.8% market share) and Google Pay (37%), which together processed 13.1 billion transactions in November 2024.
    Rising Competition:
        Competitors in the UPI space include Paytm, Navi, Cred, and Amazon Pay, alongside WhatsApp Pay’s expanding footprint.
mplications for WhatsApp Pay

The lifting of user limits positions WhatsApp Pay as a strong contender in the Indian UPI market. With its integration into the widely-used messaging app, WhatsApp Pay can leverage its massive user base to challenge established platforms like PhonePe and Google Pay.
Outlook

As the UPI ecosystem grows, the entry of a fully-enabled WhatsApp Pay could further intensify competition, benefiting users through enhanced services and innovations in the digital payments space.","WhatsApp Pay has received clearance from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to expand its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) services to all users across India.

Your words and guidance have always inspired me to strive for excellence and make the nation proud. I promise to continue delivering my best moves on 64 squares and outside of it. Thank you Hon. Sports Minister @mansukhmandviya Ji for your constant support.""

D Gukesh's chess accomplishments

Gukesh won the World Chess Championship last month beating Ding Liren in the 14th round in Singapore on Thursday.  The Chennai resident broke the previous record set by the legendary Garry Kasparov, who was just 22 when he beat then-champion Anatoly Karpov in 1985 to become world champion.

Gukesh also broke the record of becoming the youngest-ever winner of the FIDE Candidates tournament in April. He topped the points table with nine points in the eight-player competition, becoming only the second Indian to qualify for a World Championship final after five-time World champion and his mentor Viswanathan Anand. 

He also became the youngest player to beat Magnus Carlsen at the Aim Chess Rapid tournament, since the Norwegian became World Champion. Carrying the momentum into 2023, Gukesh became the youngest-ever player to reach a rating of 2750. He soon surpassed Viswanathan Anand as the top-ranked Indian player for the first time in 37 years. ","World Chess Champion D Gukesh is all set to make history after being selected for Khel Ratna Award. At 18 years, 7 months, and 20 days, Gukesh will break the record currently held by Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, who received the award at the age of 19 years, 11 months, and 2 days. Bindra had won gold in Beijing."

wdcoiw1r-1,"New information from a reputed data miner claims Valve has already started playtesting Half-Life 3. If everything goes well, an announcement may also come in 2025.
Half-Life 3 is among one of the most anticipated games, and a new rumour suggests that people might finally get a first look at the game next year. The report comes from a recent video from popular data miner Gabe Follower, who explains their reasoning why 2025 might be the year Valve finally announced Half-Life 3.

Gabe Follower has been on the trailer for Half-Life 3 for the last few months and have reportedly found various pieces of evidence pointing towards a new Half-Life game. It’s been almost two decades since the last mainline entry in the Half-Life franchise was released, and the term “HLX” has been floating around for a while.
“According to my information, in the last few months, Valve has started active HLX playtests. Now not only with people from other teams, but also friends and family members,” Gabe Follower said. To back his statement, Gab Follower also mentions that Valve has been hiring a lot of character artists, environment artists and devs.

When is Half Life 3 releasing?

There were a lot of rumours regarding what may be present inside Half-Life 3 but as usual, anything related to the release remains a huge mystery. A few weeks back during the Game Awards, there were rumours that Valve may announce the game, but that did not happen.

“If it survives the New Year holidays and there are no serious problems during these playtests with the close circle of people, then the development will continue at the right pace, and the announcement in 2025 may turn out to be quite possible,” the video further added.

As per Gabe Follower, Source 2 is also being upgraded heavily integration of CUDA cores, DLSS and other things. Along with that, Valve might also be adding some innovative gameplay mechanics relating to altered gravity. The setting for the Half-Life series is already in a sci-fi world, so this does make sense.","Half-Life 3 is among one of the most anticipated games and after over a decade long wait, new rumour suggests that people might finally get a first look as soon as next year.

q4jkbgkk-1,"Stardew Valley is undoubtedly one of the most popular cosy games. In a recent update on the official website, it was revealed that the game sold over 10 million copies in 2024 which is quite impressive. The game might also be the reason why Steam year-end review revealed most players spent their time playing older games this year.

The majority of the players are on PC (presumably Steam) while the rest were from various platforms including Nintendo Switch. “As of December 2024, Stardew Valley has sold over 41 million copies across all platforms, with over 26 million copies sold on PC, and 7.9 million copies on the Nintendo Switch,” the update revealed.

Released back in 2016, Stardew Valley was developed by a single developer named ‘ConcernedApe’. The 10 million-plus sale count came after a previous update early this year revealed that the game surpassed 30 million copies in sales back in February. The actual sales count for this year may be well over 11 million in reality.

Stardew Valley now outselling Hogwarts Legacy

With a massive sales number, Stardew Valley has now surpassed some of the most notable game releases. These include Hogwarts Legacy, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Diablo III and a lot of popular Call of Duty games. What’s impressive is that all of these games mentioned are multi-platform, although Stardew Valley is more multi-platform with releases for iOS, Android and even Linux.

A simple reason is the pricing for the game, as it is available for $15 and less much of the time. However, that isn’t the only thing, as the biggest factor is how fun and relaxing the gameplay is. Players can also play the game in co-op with up to three friends. The game is constantly updated, so it may not be surprising to see it reach close to Terraria in sales numbers in the next few years.","One of the most popular cosy games, 'Stardew Valley', released back in 2016, has achieved a new milestone of 41 million sales as revealed by the creator in his official statement.

yini5fgc-1,"On Monday, December 30, AC Milan appointed Sergio Conceicao as their new manager after sacking Paulo Fonseca from the job, following their 1-1 draw against Roma at the San Siro in the Serie A. Sergio Conceicao, who is the former midfielder for Lazio, Parma, and Inter Milan before managing Porto in his second coming in football, has signed an 18-month deal to take the helm of the footballing affairs on the pitch at AC Milan.
During his managerial tenure with FC Porto, which lasted for a whopping six years, Sergio Conceicao won 11 trophies at the Portuguese club including multiple league titles. After leaving them at the end of last season, the 50-year-old has a tough task at hand to bring AC Milan back into the title contention as they are currently struggling in eighth place in Serie A with just 27 points in 17 matches, finding themselves 14 points behind leaders Atalanta and Napoli.
The first game in-charge of AC Milan for Portuguese manager Sergio Conceicao is set to happen on January 3 next year when they take on Juventus in the first leg of the Italian Super Cup semi-final at the King Saud University Stadium in Saudi Arabia. In this high octane Italian club football clash, Sergio Conceicao of AC Milan will be pitted against his own son Francisco Conceicao, the 22-year-old, who is an integral part of Juventus currently.
Moreover, Paulo Fonseca, who was appointed as manager of AC Milan in place of Stefano Pioli, didn’t have a great time helming the prestigious club in the league and Europe. While their Serie A form has been quite disappointing over the last five months, AC Milan have done a bit better in the UEFA Champions League this season, winning four and losing two out of six matches, to find themselves in 12th place in a 36-team tournament.

oxn4elph-1,"As the official reveal window for the Nintendo Switch 2 draws closer, more information is now surfacing about the device. A new Nintendo patent is now making rounds suggesting that the Switch 2 will likely have features like AI based upscaling tech, with mention of Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) which one of the upscaling techs.

Most recently, an image for the Switch 2 motherboard revealed an Nvidia chip, which further confirms the feature. Shared by industry insider Laura Kate Dale, the patent was originally filed back in July 2023 and was made public on December 31, 2024.

The patent also mentions upscaling images up to 4k, which is a massive feat. Although the tech will likely help running games with lower hit on the device or not at all as pointed by Laura in a follow-up post. The upscale feature is not running while the device is running games on the regular screen of the console, but uses upscaling when connected to an external display.
There is could be a good reason behind this. The Nintendo Switch 2 will likely not have a 4k display, as it’s a handheld console. However, since users can connect the device to an external display to play on a big screen, this feature could come in handy.

Nintendo Switch 2 shaping up to be an incredible release

With so many leaks floating around, revealed what kind of hardware, Switch 2 seemingly have improved significantly over its predecessor. Some rumours even claim that the device will match PS4 Pro in terms of performance, which is yet to be confirmed.

Although it will likely not be available anywhere else as they plan to compete within domestic borders.

As reported by HBR, Anton Gorelkin, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy revealed that the gaming console will be built on an Elbrus processor and will also use other domestic components for manufacturing. However, the competition is currently not even close, as the processors in talks are still far from matching current generation consoles like PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

“I hope that my colleagues will approach this task with full responsibility and come up with something truly breakthrough. After all, it is obvious to everyone: Elbrus processors are not yet at the stage of development that would ensure equal competition with PS5 and Xbox, which means that the solution must be non-standard,” said Anton Gorelkin, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy.
Can Russia compete with Xbox and PlayStation?

The processor was originally designed for defence and infrastructure applications in Russia. Gorelkin clearly mentioned that these aren’t ready for gaming, but they are working on improving the performance. It is very unlikely that the console will be able to match the Xbox or PlayStation any time soon. 

Apart from the gaming console, there is also a cloud gaming console in development as purported by rbc.ru.

bu8xsuxb-1,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has reportedly found evidence of anti-competitive conduct by Apple in relation to its App Store operations in the country.

The conclusion was reached after investigating the tech giant's app store processes, sources familiar with the matter told Mint.

The CCI is yet to announce its final decision on the matter but has shared a confidential version of its investigation report with Apple and Apple Distribution International Ltd.
CCI's investigation confirms violation of competition law

The CCI's investigation report has confirmed a breach of India's competition law provisions prohibiting abuse of dominance.

The probe into Apple's App Store practices was launched in December 2021, after concerns over the mandatory use of Apple's in-app payment solution for paid apps and in-app purchases.

This requirement was viewed as restricting developers' freedom to choose their preferred payment processing system, and thus anti-competitive.
Allegations against Apple's in-app payment solution

The allegations against Apple revolved around its in-app payment solution, In-App Purchase (IAP), for distributing paid digital content.

The tech giant was also slammed for the commission it charges, which can go as high as 30% for app purchases and in-app purchases.

These practices were considered by the CCI as 'unfair' and violating India's competition law.


Apple's previous regulatory issues in the European Union

Apple has already been subjected to a similar regulatory action in the European Union.

Back in March 2024, the European Commission had fined Apple over €1.8 billion for ""abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps to iPhone and iPad users through its App Store.""

The Commission had found that Apple placed restrictions on app developers, preventing them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

Apple's defense and CCI's confidentiality principle

In response to CCI's 2021 order to initiate the probe, Apple had said its App Store review guidelines were neither unfair nor arbitrary.

The tech giant claimed these measures were put in place to ensure a safe and secure platform for consumers to discover and download apps as well as purchase digital content.

Sharing the confidential version of CCI investigation report with Apple is in line with principles of confidentiality and fairness under Indian law.","A probe by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has found that Apple violated India's antitrust laws, The Mint reported.

pyaeto5w-1,"Wi-Fi will be available on Air India’s Airbus A350, Boeing 787-9, and select Airbus A321neo aircraft. The in-flight internet works on two kinds of technology: air-to-ground system and satellite-based Wi-Fi system
Passengers of Air India domestic flights will now be able to browse internet, check social media and text on WhatsApp while flying above 10,000 feet, the Tata-owned airline has announced. The free Wi-Fi service is enabled for both iOS and Android mobile phones, laptops and tablets.

The service follows an initial pilot programme on Air India’s international routes, including flights to New York, London, Paris, and Singapore, it said in the release.

Which Air India Planes Have Onboard Wi-Fi?

Wi-Fi will be available on the airline’s Airbus A350, Boeing 787-9, and select Airbus A321neo aircraft. The airline was already offering Internet connectivity on board international flights operated by these aircraft as part of an ongoing pilot programme.

Besides the new A350 aircraft, the other planes are understood to be those of erstwhile Vistara, which merged with Air India in November. All these aircraft are equipped with special hardware required to offer Internet connectivity on board. Vistara had been offering Internet on select international flights prior to the merger.

On Vistara aircraft, the service was provided by another Tata Group company, Nelco, in partnership with Panasonic Avionics Corporation. The same is being provided to Air India domestic flights, as per a report by The Indian Express.

How To Access Air India Wi-Fi

Here’s how passengers can access Wi-Fi aboard Air India flights:

• Enable Wi-Fi on your device and go to Wi-Fi settings

• Select the ‘Air India Wi-Fi’ network

• Once redirected to the Air India portal in your browser, enter your PNR and last name

How In-Flight Internet Works?

The in-flight internet systems are based on two kinds of technology. The first is an air-to-ground system. Here, an antenna on board the aircraft will pick up signals from the nearest tower on the ground. Up to a certain altitude, the connection will remain seamless, unless the aircraft passes over an area without ground towers.

Basically, the ground towers project signals upwards. Also, the on-board antennas used in this case are fitted beneath the airplane.

The second is the satellite-based Wi-Fi system, which is more popular now. Internet from ground stations is transmitted to aircraft through satellites, using antennae mounted on top of the aircraft’s body. This form of connectivity offers wider coverage, and is particularly useful in providing connectivity when the aircraft is flying over regions without ground towers.

The data is transmitted to the passenger’s personal device through an on-board router, which is connected to the aircraft’s antenna. When the aircraft reaches an altitude of 3,000 metres, the on-board antenna will switch to satellite-based services.

The in-flight Wi-Fi is typically much slower than on the ground.

How Expensive Is The In-Flight Wi-Fi?

Airlines have to bear the initial cost of installing antennae on aircraft. They are of the view that installing equipment on the new aircraft is much easier for them rather than taking planes out of service for retrofitting.

For Air India, which is has taken up a $400-million retrofit programme to refurbish its legacy narrow-body fleet, it might make sense to equip its older planes with Internet connectivity equipment as part of that exercise.

It is worth noting that the aircraft on which the airline is currently offering Wi-Fi are significantly newer than much of the carrier’s legacy fleet, and came installed with the necessary equipment.

Most international airlines offer a limited volume of free Internet before asking the customer to buy a data pack, which is expensive. Some carriers provide limited or unlimited Internet to members of their loyalty programmes, and business class and first-class passengers.

Why Mobile Data Is Prohibited On Planes?

According to the Civil Aviation Authority, “scientific research has shown that mobile phones can interfere with the normal operation of aircraft equipment and can also cause interference in pilot’s headsets"".

The radio waves that certain electronic devices emit can significantly impact the pilot’s navigation and radar tools, connectivity with ground control and even collision avoidance technologies.

“While most mobile phones don’t emit strong radio waves, devices including Kindles, iPods, laptops and even handheld gaming consoles all also give off radio waves, especially in a compact space,"" Laura Lindsay, Skyscanner’s travel expert told Conde Nast.

Can Phone Calls Be Made In Flight?

In 2022, Europe approved phone calls and data use during flights. By 2023, European airlines introduced 5G onboard, enabling passengers to make calls and send texts.

To support this, the EU allocated specific frequencies (4.2–4.4 GHz) for in-flight 5G, distinct from land-based 5G (3.4–3.8 GHz), ensuring no interference with aircraft systems.

Additionally, EU regulations mandate the installation of “pico cells"" on planes. These devices manage phone signals, preventing them from disrupting aviation communication systems.

The US Federal Communications Commission in 2020 scuttled plans to allow in-flight voice and data services via mobile wireless frequencies, saying that there was strong opposition including from airline pilots and flight attendants on safety and national security grounds, as per a report by Bloomberg.","In-flight Wi-Fi is based on two kinds of technology.

Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, and it continues to be an important public health issue in low- and middle-income countries. In India, cervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality, accounting for 18.3% of all cancers and 18.7% of female cancer deaths in 2020, as stated in a report by BioMed Central. Despite the availability of effective screening methods, including Pap smears and HPV testing, the disease is still killing hundreds of thousands every year. However, AI is emerging as a transformational tool in the early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer. So, let’s explore how AI is revolutionizing the future of cervical cancer detection in India, which will highlight its potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of early diagnosis and collaboration necessary to realize this potential.

The Growing Burden of Cervical Cancer in India

Cervical cancer remains a major public health issue in India, where the lack of widespread access to quality healthcare and screening programs exacerbates the problem. India accounts for a significant proportion of the global burden of cervical cancer, with an incidence rate that continues to rise, particularly in rural and underserved areas. The disease is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 16 and 18. Although HPV vaccines are available, their uptake remains limited due to various socio-cultural and infrastructural barriers. Early detection through screening and timely treatment is critical in reducing mortality rates. Still, challenges such as limited access to healthcare resources, inadequate awareness, and a shortage of skilled professionals hinder effective screening efforts.
The Promise of Artificial Intelligence in Cervical Cancer Detection

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare, particularly in diagnostics, has the potential to overcome many of these barriers. AI, which includes machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and other computational techniques, has already shown great promise in various medical fields, and its application in cervical cancer detection is no exception. The advantages of AI in this context are manifold. AI algorithms can process vast amounts of data—such as cervical cell images, genomic data, and patient histories—with high accuracy and speed. This capability enables the automation of image interpretation, which can significantly reduce the workload of pathologists and increase the efficiency of screening programs.
AI as a Complementary Tool in HPV Testing and Cytology

HPV testing combined with cervical-vaginal cytology forms the basis for cervical cancer screening in every country. Such tests allow for early diagnosis but bear inherent limitations, especially within low-resource contexts. Usually, HPV testing necessitates costly equipment and expert personnel that most cannot afford. While cytology-based methods can sometimes fail to identify minor cellular anomalies or are susceptible to inter-observer variability, which in turn diminishes the effectiveness of screening programs. AI is increasingly proving to be a robust supplementary tool that can overcome these limitations by making cervical cancer screening more precise, efficient, and accessible.

AI is emerging as a powerful complementary tool to overcome these challenges by enhancing the precision, efficiency, and accessibility of cervical cancer screening. AI algorithms are being trained to detect intricate patterns in cytology samples and HPV test results, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy. In cytology, AI can analyze cell morphology in Pap smear slides with remarkable precision, identifying abnormal cells indicative of precancerous or cancerous changes that might otherwise be missed by human observers. This capability not only reduces diagnostic errors but also helps streamline laboratory workflows. 

In HPV testing, AI can assist in interpreting complex data, such as viral load and genotyping results. This allows for a more nuanced risk assessment, enabling clinicians to prioritize patients with high-risk HPV types for closer monitoring or early intervention. Moreover, AI-powered systems can process large volumes of samples efficiently, making them ideal for scaling up screening programs in resource-constrained settings. 

By addressing the limitations of traditional methods, AI has the potential to revolutionize cervical cancer screening. It promises not only to enhance accuracy but also to make these life-saving tests more accessible and cost-effective, thereby contributing to the global fight against cervical cancer.
Overcoming the Limitations of Current Screening Methods

Despite the benefits of AI in cervical cancer detection, there are still challenges to be addressed. One of the primary limitations of existing screening methods is the variability in test results due to human error or the subjective nature of interpretation. While AI has the potential to reduce this variability, the technology is not without its challenges. For instance, AI algorithms must be trained on large and diverse datasets to ensure that they are generalizable and accurate across different populations. In countries like India, where demographic and genetic factors may vary, AI models must account for these differences to avoid biases in detection.

Moreover, the use of AI in cervical cancer detection raises important regulatory and ethical considerations. The deployment of AI-based diagnostic tools must be carefully regulated to ensure that they meet safety and efficacy standards. Additionally, there is a need for transparent and explainable AI systems, where healthcare providers can understand how AI algorithms arrive at their conclusions. This is especially important in the medical field, where decisions based on AI recommendations can have life-or-death consequences.
Collaborative Efforts for a Sustainable Future

The integration of AI into cervical cancer detection and treatment necessitates robust collaboration among healthcare providers, researchers, policymakers, and technology companies. In India, initiatives like the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution India, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, are paving the way for accelerated cancer interventions, including the use of AI. Such collaborative frameworks are vital to address challenges such as infrastructure gaps, limited access to advanced technologies, and insufficient training for healthcare professionals in resource-limited settings.

tfkgq5vn-1,"Apart from being helpful to the general population, in carefully selected scenarios, wearables serve as an important support system even for doctors in treating their patients.

In the medical field, wearables can be useful for Diagnostic purposes, Monitoring purposes, and; to some extent, be a part of treatment modalities for certain diseases.

The history of wearables can be dated back to centuries ago when human beings tried to use wristwatches and hearing aids. The first advanced scientific wearable was seen around the year 1970 in the form of calculator wristwatches. Real momentum for wearables picked up after the introduction of smartwatches around 2013. Since 2013, smart watches, smart glasses, and smart wristbands have been the most commonly used wearables by the population for their health care needs.

The Covid pandemic provided valuable insights regarding improvements and advancements needed in the existing smartwatches. The current generation of smartwatches has features that include monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, ECG, sleep quality, step count, and calorie count. With multiple parameters being added to the current generation of smartwatches, the concepts of QUANTIFIED SELF, BODY HACKING, or SELF SURVEILLANCE are gaining recognition. Let us understand how wearables can have an impact on healthcare; both positive and negative.

The biggest advantage of using wearables is that it inculcates a sense of responsibility in a person towards his health. Being aware and obsessed about one’s own health parameters helps a person plan his or her lifestyle goals. Wearables also serve as a medium to impart some basic health care information to a common man as to what are the normal ranges for various health parameters of the human body. In many cases, it helps a person to seek medical help when required. Apart from being helpful to the general population, in carefully selected scenarios, it serves as an important support system even for doctors in treating their patients. We discuss a few important health conditions and how wearables can serve for the betterment of patients.
Impact on Cardiovascular Health

Monitoring of Heart rate is very important for patients suffering from cardiac problems. Wearables help detect abnormalities in heart rate and help alarming the person to seek medical attention on time. In advanced smart watches, heart rate when combined with ECG monitoring can help diagnose life-threatening arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm) and can be lifesaving in such scenarios. Blood Pressure monitoring is a feature available in the current generation of smartwatches which is very useful to patients suffering from Hypertension. Round-the-clock blood pressure control helps prevent heart attacks, strokes (paralysis), and renal failure in the future. Understanding the blood pressure patterns of a patient can help the doctor time the medicine intake for the patient.
Impact on Diabetes

Diabetes Mellitus is the modern global pandemic. Glucose monitoring is central to understanding and planning the treatment needs of any patient. Glucose fluctuations are also very common in diabetic patients. Glucose monitoring through wearables can be a great boon to both; the patient and the doctor. Blood sugar patterns can help doctors give accurate insulin dosage to the patient. Tight sugar control can prevent blindness by preventing diabetic retinopathy; also reduces the chances of suffering from kidney failure and heart attacks in the future. Smartwatches and Microneedle-based skin patches are two available wearables for blood glucose monitoring.
Impact on Lung Diseases

During the COVID-19 pandemic, blood oxygen saturation monitoring gained importance in the minds of common people. A pulse oximeter was widely used during the pandemic for self-monitoring of blood oxygen levels (saturation). The current generation of smartwatches have oxygen saturation measuring capacities. It can help detect low blood oxygen levels and seek medical care on time. For patients suffering from chronic lung diseases, it can help in deciding the quantum of oxygen supplementation required at home for the patient.

This can help improve the quality of life of the patient and also prevent heart attacks due to low oxygen levels. Smart Masks help in detecting oxygen and carbon dioxide levels of the exhaled air, as well as levels of inflammatory markers in the exhaled air; allowing us to quantify the disease load in the lungs.
Impact on Eye Diseases

Wearable lenses are a breakthrough in managing certain eye diseases. Smart lenses have inbuilt microelectronic processing units that measure the intraocular pressure. This is very helpful in treating Glaucoma and improving the quality of life of the patient with Glaucoma.
Impact on Brain Disorders

Seizure Alerting Wearable is another research product in the pipeline. Complex data regarding brain activity are collected and analyzed using the seizure alerting wearable. A timely alert message or SOS message is sent to the patient, relative, or the treating doctor alerting before the onset of the seizure. Real-time EEG recording can also be possible by these devices. This helps in preventing the seizure by intervening in time. Wearable caps are also devised for patients with Parkinsonism. Continued data collection by the wearable from the brain of Parkinson’s patients can be useful to the doctor in planning the treatment modalities for the patient. Extensive feedback data collected from the wearables in bedridden patients can be utilized to create an improved quality of life for these patients.
Impact on Psychiatric Disorders

Virtual Reality (VR) based wearable devices are being successfully used for treating PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). The creation of different scenarios by VR headsets is used for the above process. VR devices are also useful for relaxing the mind and decreasing stress levels thus improving mental health.

There are certain drawbacks of wearables that are worth understanding. The quality of software used, standardization of the hardware and software, and accuracy of the data collected can vary in cases. False diagnoses and false alarms can also be a problem. Device failures can cause missing out on valuable health information. People should realize that wearables are to be used as a support system for health improvement and not as a replacement for classic human-human interaction between a doctor and a patient. They are just one of the many devices that are present in today’s healthcare system. Ultimately a human touch is always needed for healing.","The biggest advantage of using wearables is that they foster a sense of responsibility toward personal health. Being aware and even obsessed with health parameters can help individuals plan and achieve their lifestyle goals. Wearables also act as a tool to educate users about normal health parameter ranges, making healthcare more accessible to the average person."
jhnnkevl-1,"India’s groundwater crisis demands urgent action, with over-extraction and pollution threatening water security, agriculture, and ecosystems. Sustainable practices, strong regulations, and innovation are essential to protect this critical resource for future generations.

'Groundwater' is often referred to as the hidden lifeblood of our planet, essential for sustaining agriculture, industry, and communities. However, beneath this essential resource lies a growing crisis: the rapid depletion of groundwater reserves. In India, this problem has reached alarming levels, jeopardizing water security, ecosystems, and livelihoods.

Excessive groundwater extraction for irrigation, drinking, and industrial use has led to a steady decline in the water table, challenging well access. India, home to 16% of the global population but with just 4% of the world’s freshwater, is at a crucial point in managing this limited resource.

The issue is deeply rooted in the agricultural boom of the Green Revolution, which prioritized groundwater for irrigation. Today, over 60% of India’s irrigated agriculture and 85% of rural domestic water needs are met by groundwater. According to the Central Groundwater Board, 17% of India’s groundwater blocks are classified as over-exploited, with extraction far exceeding natural recharge rates- a situation worsened by climate change and pollution.
Key Drivers of Groundwater Depletion

1. Agricultural Demand and Water-Intensive Crops

Agriculture dominates groundwater consumption, especially with high water-demand crops like paddy and sugarcane. Farmers continue to favor these crops for financial returns, even in arid regions, leading to excessive extraction.

2. Energy Subsidies Fuel Over-Extraction

Power subsidies in agriculture have incentivized unregulated pumping, adding to groundwater depletion.

3. Weak Regulation

With insufficient policies governing groundwater usage, both urban and rural areas face unchecked extraction. The lack of stringent regulations on private groundwater ownership has further deepened the crisis.

4. Green Revolution Legacy

High-yield crops introduced during the Green Revolution remain prevalent, adding pressure to already vulnerable regions.

5. Groundwater Contamination

Contaminants such as arsenic, nitrate, fluoride, and salinity compromise groundwater quality. Pollution from fertilizers, industrial waste, and poor waste management has impacted nearly 60% of Indian districts.

Common Groundwater Contaminants and Their Effects

    Nitrates from fertilizers and sewage contribute to health risks like methemoglobinemia.

    Pathogens from poor sanitation lead to waterborne diseases.

    Trace Metals from industrial activities, such as lead and cadmium, pose carcinogenic risks.

    Inorganic Compounds degrade water quality, affecting human health and water hardness.

    Organic Compounds from pesticides and industrial discharges harm ecosystems and health.

Initiatives to Address Groundwater Depletion

India has launched several programs targeting groundwater conservation:

    National Water Policy (2012) promotes efficient water use across all sectors.

    Bureau of Water Use Efficiency (BWUE) develops standards for water-efficient products and practices.

    Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) regulates large-scale groundwater extraction.

    Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) aims to provide safe drinking water for every rural household.

    Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) focuses on monsoon water conservation, with the current theme emphasizing women’s role in water management.

    Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABY) encourages water-efficient practices in water-scarce areas.

Strategies for Sustainable Groundwater Management

To address the ongoing challenge of groundwater depletion and contamination, it is crucial to implement a multifaceted approach. The following strategies can help ensure the sustainable use and management of groundwater resources.

1. Strengthening Groundwater Regulations

To protect groundwater resources, it is essential to enforce stricter regulations on industrial waste disposal and agricultural practices that contribute to over-extraction and contamination. A comprehensive permit system for groundwater extraction should be introduced, where quotas for usage are based on the rate at which aquifers can naturally recharge. This would help prevent over-exploitation and ensure long-term water availability.

2. Promoting Sustainable Agricultural Practices

Shifting towards sustainable farming methods is key to reducing the strain on groundwater resources. Farmers should be encouraged to adopt precision agriculture techniques, which optimize the use of water and fertilizers. Subsidies and training programs can be provided to support the adoption of efficient irrigation systems like drip irrigation, as well as practices that minimize water wastage, such as crop diversification and proper soil management.

3. Investing in Water Infrastructure

Increased investment is needed in wastewater treatment infrastructure to prevent untreated sewage from contaminating groundwater sources. Expanding and upgrading sewage treatment plants, along with establishing effective wastewater recycling systems, can help reduce the harmful impact of urban and industrial waste on water quality.

4. Decentralized Water Management

Empowering local communities is critical for effective water management. Establishing participatory models like Water User Associations (WUAs) can enable communities to take responsibility for groundwater planning, monitoring, and regulation at the local level. This approach fosters greater ownership and accountability, leading to more sustainable water use practices.

5. Encouraging Blue Credit Schemes

Financial incentives, such as Blue Credit programs, can encourage water conservation efforts in both domestic and industrial sectors. These incentives could support rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and the adoption of water-saving technologies, providing a sustainable financial model for water conservation.

6. Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a transformative role in groundwater management. By analyzing large datasets on water quality, usage trends, and aquifer conditions, AI can help predict contamination risks, monitor water resources more efficiently, and design targeted interventions. AI-powered tools could also assist in optimizing water usage and improving the accuracy of water resource management decisions.

These strategies, when implemented collectively, have the potential to create a more sustainable and resilient approach to groundwater management in India, securing the future of this essential resource for generations to come.","India's groundwater crisis demands urgent action, with over-extraction and pollution threatening water security, agriculture, and ecosystems.

ozeq2xlv-1,"Many young people suddenly collapse with a heart attack while playing cricket, dancing at weddings or family gatherings, celebrating garba dance, and many other occasions!

It was once thought that heart attacks and cardiac conditions only affected “seniors,” but in recent years, young people—particularly those under 40—are reporting more heart disorders than ever before. During the holiday season, there have been startling reports of young people—roughly in their 20s and 30s—having heart attacks while having fun. Many young people suddenly collapse with a heart attack while playing cricket, dancing at weddings or family gatherings, celebrating garba dance, and many other occasions! Medical research indicates that heart attacks are more common in the winter, especially around Christmas and New Year’s. 

On Holidays routines are disrupted; we may tend to eat and drink more and exercise and relax less. We also may not be listening to our bodies or paying attention to warning signs, thinking it can wait until after the new year. All of these can be contributors to increasing the risk of heart attack at this time of the year.

Dr. Hemant Khemani, Senior Cardiologist from Apex Group of Hospitals in Borivali said, “While the holidays can be the most wonderful time of the year, they can also be one of the most stressful—especially for the heart. In festivals many people munch fatty & oily (fast food), sweets and higher quantities of alcohol, which can do more damage to your body, especially causing heart problems, also busy holidays can cause you to skip medications, forgetting them when away from home or not carrying them. Excess consumption of salt and alcohol can lead your heart to beat irregularly and cause palpitations, which if ignored can lead to serious heart issues, including heart failure and stroke.”

Dr. Khemani further added, “Many festivals celebrated with loud music especially New Year celebrations in banquets, party hall, clubs & hotels but when a person who is already facing heart issues and exposed to loud music, his or her heartbeat increases rapidly, just as it goes up while jogging or doing physical exercises. An irregular heartbeat is called atrial fibrillation (AFib) and due to this, there are dangers like heart attack, brain stroke and blood clots. Scientists believe that any activity that increases blood pressure can trigger fibrillation and the same happens with loud noises. The longer you are in atrial fibrillation, the more chance there is to form a stroke, or to develop heart weakness or heart failure from having such a rapid heartbeat.”","During holiday season, there have been reports of young people having heart attacks while having fun.

twrkmibp-1,"Stress can be both acute and chronic. Both may result in a variety of negative consequences, but long-term stress can have detrimental impacts on one’s health.

These days, the term “stress” is rather common. But is diabetes brought on by stress? No! Although it can impact your blood sugar levels, it doesn’t cause diabetes. Though stress cannot be avoided, we can control it by learning how it functions and how to deal with it. 
Mechanism of stress

The adrenal glands produce two key stress hormones: adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline helps increase heart rate and blood pressure and provides a surge of energy. Cortisol, the main stress hormone, boosts blood sugar levels, supports brain function by improving glucose use, and aids in tissue repair by making necessary resources more accessible.

Additionally, in a fight-or-flight scenario, cortisol slows down processes that would be dangerous or unnecessary. It alters the immune system’s reaction and inhibits the development of the reproductive and digestive systems. Moreover, this complex natural alarm system affects the brain that controls our emotions and feelings. 
How our body manages stress

Generally speaking, the body’s stress response mechanism is self-limiting. Hormone levels return to normal after a perceived threat has passed. Your blood pressure and heart rate return to normal when your cortisol and adrenaline levels decline. 

Other systems resume their normal operations. However, that fight-or-flight response remains activated when there are constant stressors and you constantly feel attacked. 
Impact of chronic stress on hormones

Prolonged activation of the stress response system and excessive exposure to stress hormones like cortisol can cause disruptions in nearly every bodily function.
Known as insulin-resistant, these two hormones can make insulin less effective by preventing the pancreas from producing insulin cells. Stress can trigger the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Higher cortisol and reduced sex hormone levels are two examples of the hormonal alterations that may result from this. Insulin levels depend on these hormone levels. Stress causes some people to overeat, which can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes. 
Long-term effect of stress on diabetes

Stress can be both acute and chronic. Both may result in a variety of negative consequences, but long-term stress can have detrimental impacts on one’s health. The primary hormonal reaction to stress is mediated by catecholamines and glucocorticoids (GC). These hormones don’t have any negative consequences right away, but over time, they might cause problems with glucose homeostasis. Insulin resistance and type II diabetes may result from this disruption of glucose homeostasis, which can cause persistent hyperglycemia.
Symptoms of stress

Anxiety, depression, headaches, muscular tension, heart disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep disturbances, weight gain, memory and concentration troubles, and hormonal imbalances are among the many of the health issues that stress can exacerbate.

A person’s waist-to-hip ratio may increase if their hormone levels are out of balance. When there is a greater waist-to-hip ratio, the waist is bigger than the hip. This poses a significant risk for both diabetes and heart disease. 
Managing Stress 

Individuals respond differently to stressful situations because of things like heredity and life experiences. Comprehending your individual stressors is crucial. It is possible to safeguard both your physical and mental well-being in difficult conditions. The following rules will help you deal with stress:

    Maintaining a healthy diet, having adequate water and engaging in regular exercise, along with proper rest can help you control stress.
    Including relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing, and massage will help to soothe and calm your stress hormones. 
    Adopting a habit of writing journal.
    Adding some leisure time in your daily schedule, making time for music or reading before bed, or watching your preferred television program or film. 
    Engaging in conversation with loved ones, and friends. Taking up volunteer work in your society or community. 
    Reaching out to a counselor or physician if needed. 
    Avoiding unhealthy stress-reduction techniques including abusing drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or overeating. ","Stress is common, but it doesn't cause diabetes, though it can affect blood sugar levels. While stress can’t be avoided, it can be managed by understanding its effects. Both acute and chronic stress can lead to negative outcomes, with long-term stress having particularly harmful impacts on overall health. Learning to cope with stress is essential for well-being."

Mary Kenneth Keller, a member of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, holds a remarkable place in history as the first woman in the United States to earn a PhD in computer science. Her extraordinary achievements demonstrate how barriers of gender, profession, and faith can be transcended to contribute significantly to the world. This is her story.
Early Life and Education

Born on December 17, 1913, in Cleveland, Ohio, as Evelyn Marie Keller, her early life remains a mystery, with even her year of birth debated. She joined the Sisters of Charity in 1932, taking her vows in 1940. An academic at heart, Keller pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics (1943) and a Master’s in Mathematics and Physics (1953) from DePaul University. Her educational pursuits set the stage for her pioneering role in computer science.
Contributions to Computer Science: Shaping Accessibility

Keller’s journey into computer science took her through prestigious institutions like the University of Michigan, Purdue, and Dartmouth. At Dartmouth College, despite the male-dominated environment, she contributed to developing the BASIC programming language. BASIC transformed computing by enabling individuals without advanced mathematical training to write code. Her doctoral dissertation, titled “Inductive Inference on Computer Generated Patterns”, focused on algorithms for analytic differentiation in CDC FORTRAN 63, marking her as an icon in computational research.
Founding Clarke College's Computer Science Department

In 1965, after earning her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Keller established the computer science department at Clarke College (now Clarke University) in Iowa. Under her leadership for two decades, the department became popular for integrating computer education into broader learning frameworks. Keller envisioned a future where computers enhanced accessibility to knowledge for people from all walks of life, a reality that has become indispensable in modern education.

Advocacy for Women in Computing

Keller championed the inclusion of women in computing, a field traditionally dominated by men. She co-founded the Association of Small Computer Users in Education (ASCUE), a platform dedicated to promoting technology in education. Her advocacy extended beyond words—through her work, she inspired generations of women to pursue careers in STEM.
Legacy and Recognition

Keller’s enduring legacy is commemorated through initiatives like the Keller Computer Center and Information Services at Clarke University and the Mary Kenneth Keller Computer Science Scholarship. 

Mary Kenneth Keller’s life was one of perseverance, vision, and breaking barriers. As an educator, advocate, and pioneer, she not only expanded the frontiers of computer science but also paved the way for inclusivity and accessibility in education and technology.","Mary Kenneth Keller, a member of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, holds a remarkable place in history as the first woman in the United States to earn a PhD in computer science.

ryi4bygz-1,"Dayle Haddon was everything from model to actor, and a trailblazing activist. But her greatest legacy, perhaps, would be helping open up the fashion industry to ‘older’ models and pushing against age limits. Haddon, a former Sports Illustrated model who created waves by reentering the industry as a widow, has died in a Pennsylvania home from what authorities believe was carbon monoxide poisoning.

Authorities in Bucks County found Haddon, 76, dead in a second-floor bedroom Friday morning after emergency dispatchers were notified about a person unconscious at the Solebury Township home. A 76-year-old man police later identified as Walter J. Blucas of Erie was hospitalized in critical condition.

Responders detected a high level of carbon monoxide in the property and township police said Saturday that investigators determined that “a faulty flue and exhaust pipe on a gas heating system caused the carbon monoxide leak.” Two medics were taken to a hospital for carbon monoxide exposure and a police officer was treated at the scene.

Haddon's daughter, Ryan, said in a social media post that her mother was “everyone’s greatest champion. An inspiration to many.”

“A pure heart. A rich inner life. Touching so many lives. A life well lived. Rest in Light, Mom,” she said.
Dayle Haddon's early modelling career

Haddon was born in Toronto in 1948 and began modelling as a teenager to pay for ballet classes. According to her website, she began her career with the Canadian ballet company Les Grands Ballet Canadiens, sometime in the 60s. Modelling soon followed.

As a model, Haddon appeared on the covers of Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle and Esquire in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1973 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. She also appeared in about two dozen films from the 1970s to 1990s, according to IMDb.com, including 1994’s “Bullets Over Broadway,” starring John Cusack.
How Dayle Haddon revolutionised the industry

Haddon left modelling after giving birth to her daughter, Ryan, in the mid-1970s but then had to reenter the workforce after her husband's 1991 death. This time, she found the modelling industry far less friendly: “They said to me, ‘At 38, you’re not viable,’” Haddon told The New York Times in 2003.

Working a menial job at an advertising agency, Haddon began reaching out to cosmetic companies, telling them there was a growing market to sell beauty products to ageing baby boomers. She eventually landed a contract with Clairol, followed by Estée Lauder and then L’Oreal, for which she promoted the company's anti-ageing products for over a decade. She also hosted beauty segments for CBS’s The Early Show. ""I kept modeling, but in a different way,"" she told The Times, “I became a spokesperson for my age.”

In 2008, Haddon founded WomenOne, an organization aimed at advancing educational opportunities for girls and women in marginalized communities, including Rwanda, Haiti and Jordan.'","Dayle Haddon, an actor and a former model, died of a suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at the age of 76 at her daughter's Pennsylvania home.

Isak Andic, the founder of Spanish clothing retailer Mango, one of Europe's largest fashion groups, with nearly 2,800 stores worldwide, died Saturday in an accident, the company said.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was among the first to pay tribute to the businessman's ""entrepeneurial vision"".

While the company did not provide further details, Spanish media reports said the 71-year-old died after falling down a ravine while hiking in the mountains near Barcelona with several family members.

""It is with deep regret that we announce the unexpected death of Isak Andic, our non-executive chairman and founder of Mango,"" the Barcelona-based company's CEO, Toni Ruiz, said in a statement.

""Isak has been an example for all of us. He dedicated his life to Mango, leaving an indelible mark thanks to his strategic vision, his inspiring leadership and his unwavering commitment to values that he himself imbued in our company,"" he added.

Sanchez wrote on social network X that Andic had ""turned this Spanish firm into a world leader in fashion"" with his ""great work and entrepreneurial vision"".

The head of Catalonia's regional government, Salvador Illa, hailed Andic as ""a committed businessman who, with his leadership, has contributed to making Catalonia great and projecting it to the world.

""He leaves an indelible mark on the Catalan and global fashion sector,"" he added in a post of social network X.

The media-shy entrepreneur was one of Spain's richest men. Forbes estimates he and his family have a net worth of $4.5 billion.

Under his watch, to help boost sales the company hired big stars such as British model Kate Moss, Spanish actor Penelope Cruz, and French footballer Antoine Griezmann for its marketing campaigns.

""His legacy reflects the achievements of a business project marked by success, and also by his human quality, his proximity and the care and affection that he always had and at all times conveyed to the entire organisation,"" Ruiz said, adding ""his departure leaves a huge void"".

Born in 1953 in Istanbul, Andic moved to Barcelona in Spain's wealthy northeastern Catalonia region with his family when he was 14. 

He opened his first shop on the Paseo de Gracia, Barcelona's famous shopping street in 1984 with the help of his older brother Nahman. It was hugely successful.

Spain had just emerged from a decades-long dictatorship that ended with the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975, and consumers were hungry for more modern clothes.

One name, one brand

Andic quickly opened dozens of more stores in Spain and then abroad, starting in neighbouring Portugal and France, all under the name Mango.

He ""realised that having the same name, having the same brand in all the shops, would make the concept much stronger"", said De Vicente.

The company's versatile offerings, which encompasses both professional and casual styles, have been a hit with consumers, with Mango selling nearly 160 million items of clothing and accessories a year.

It has consolidated its position as one of the leading international fashion groups, with a major presence in more than 120 markets and 15,500 employees worldwide, according to its website. 

The retailer closed 2023 with a turnover of 3.1 billion euros.

Like its main domestic rival Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer and owner of the popular Zara brand,  Mango strives to quickly adjust its production to the latest fashion trends while offering affordable prices.

Mango does not own any factory, outsourcing its production mainly to lower-cost Turkey and Asia.

m0bpby07-1,"In an unprecedented move highlighting the shifting dynamics of the world’s largest smartphone market, Apple Inc. has announced significant price cuts on its flagship iPhone devices in China, as the tech giant grapples with intensifying competition from resurgent local manufacturers and cautious consumer spending.
Market pressures force a strategic shift

The four-day promotion, beginning January 4, offers discounts of up to 500 yuan ($68.50) on Apple’s premium devices, including the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models. This marks a notable departure from Apple’s traditionally rigid pricing strategy, reflecting growing pressure in a market where domestic brands are gaining momentum.

“Apple’s strategy has changed to adapt to the change in Chinese consumers’ shopping behavior,” explains Will Wong, senior research manager at IDC. “The value-seeking trend has made price discounts more attractive to consumers. Apple may fall behind other competitors if it doesn’t adopt such a pricing strategy.”
Huawei’s remarkable comeback

The pricing adjustment comes as Huawei, Apple’s primary domestic competitor in the premium segment, has slashed prices on its high-end devices by up to 20%. The Shenzhen-based company has demonstrated remarkable resilience, posting over 40% sales growth in the third quarter of 2024 despite ongoing U.S. restrictions. Its successful return to the premium smartphone market in August 2024 has significantly altered the competitive landscape.
Market dynamics and economic context

Recent market data reveals a shifting competitive landscape:

    Vivo emerged as China’s leading smartphone manufacturer in Q3 2024
   Apple’s sales declined by 0.3% during the same period
    Huawei’s sales surged by more than 40%
    Apple briefly dropped out of China’s top five smartphone makers before recovering its position

Government intervention and consumer behavior

The Chinese government has actively worked to stimulate consumer spending, recently expanding its trade-in program to include mobile devices, tablets, and wearables. This initiative, coupled with broader economic challenges, has created an environment where even premium brands must adapt their pricing strategies to maintain market share.

“We’ve seen market competition increase with almost everyone launching a flagship last quarter,” notes Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, highlighting the increasingly competitive nature of China’s smartphone market.
Looking ahead

As Chinese consumers become increasingly value-conscious amid economic uncertainties, Apple’s rare discount strategy signals a potential shift in how global tech giants approach the world’s largest smartphone market. The success of this promotion could set a precedent for future pricing strategies in the region.","Apple has launched rare iPhone discounts in China, offering up to 500 yuan off premium models like the iPhone 16 Pro.

kskjmyel-1,"Final Fantasy 14 players are worried that lack of repeatable content might result in player count dropping below 1 million following mixes reviews for Dawntrail.

The latest expansion for Final Fantasy 14 ‘Dawntrail’ launched to a mixed review as players complained of a weak story that most people completed within a week. One of the latest patches to further improve on player complaints is also proving unhelpful as players are leaving in droves, leaving the player count on the verge of dropping below 1 million.

As revealed in a report from LuckyBancho, shared by Reddit user Impressive_Wafer_287, following the Stormblood expansion for Final Fantasy 14, this is the first time the game has seen a dip. The new raids, Cloud of Darkness and Echoes of Vana'diel, were quite impressive, but the main demand from fans remains for repeatable content instead of stories and dungeons that can be completed fairly quickly.

Final Fantasy 14 is ultimately an MMO game, and MMO players demand grind and loot in order to properly enjoy the game. Repeatable content further gives players incentive to come back; however, they also need to be fun at the same time.

“Far too much content in this; do it once, maybe a few times if it's fun, and then never interact with it again. It doesn't help that achievements are not interesting to do, like in Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft. Achievements in this game are just milestones for doing X tedious activity Y amount of times,” one user explained.

Player count may drop below 1 million

Final Fantasy 14 Dawntrail brought in 1.4 million players, but the latest patch only saw 1.1 million players return. The retention of the returning players in the latest patch was less than 50%. If this continues, it won’t be long before the numbers reach below a million for the first time in a while.

With a new year dawning, game director and producer Naoki Yoshida revealed that the next two major updates are under development. Patches 7.2 and 7.3 are set to bring more content to the game, like job updates and new raid challenges. The update pattern remains the same, so it’s hard to tell if there will be any improvement in the player count. And while the news was interesting, many are confident that it will recover.","Following a mixed reception of the 'Dawntrail' expansion, Final Fantasy 14 players are worried that lack of repeatable content might result in player count dropping below 1 million.

Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Dragon Ball franchise, a statement made by producer Akio Iyoku during an interview hinted at more Dragon Ball announcements in 2025. While he simply said that there may be some announcements this year, he did not give much regarding what, and fans believe there may be related to movies and games.

This came during a late-night interview at a Japanese radio show, “All Night Nippon,” where they talked about the franchise in general and other things as revealed in a translation shared by ‘peraperayume’. His response regarding the announcement came when he was asked about upcoming this like movies and games.

“There ‘may’ be some announcements coming this year,” Iyoku told during the interview, which could mean a lot of things. Dragon Ball is one of the biggest franchises, and most recently, Frieza got his new form, so the hype regarding more details is very high.

Big year for Dragon Ball fans?

Now that Iyoku has confirmed that there will be new announcements, it’s just a matter of what those will be. Two movies in the series are currently rumoured to be in production, so perhaps fans will get an announcement for them.

On top of that, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero was also quite successful and reportedly the biggest launch across all Dragon Ball video games. The game already have plans for DLC bringing content from Dragon Ball Super and DAIMA, so it’s hard to tell if gamers will also get something exciting.

As of now, an announcement for the movie or anime series looks much more reasonable with the ongoing rumours and the fact that it came from the producer. However, the gaming community does not need to lose hope that easily. As the success of Dragon Ball, Sparking Zero may encourage the development of a completely new game.","In a recent interview celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Dragon Ball franchise, producer Akio Iyoku revealed that fans 'may' get some fresh announcements this year.

0c9kvev9-1,"Arup Ghosh learned to prepare seeds and saplings of high-yielding Tennis Ball marigold variety in Thailand. It produces bright, firm flowers that sell at a premium. He sells over 4 crore saplings apart from flowers and seeds, clocking Rs50 lakh a month.

After understanding the basics, he visited Hyderabad’s Gudimalkapur Flower Market, which procures marigold strings, tube roses (rajnigandha) and other flowers from Kolaghat.
In Hyderabad, he took up a job at one of the shops. “I worked for Rs3500 per month. Though the salary was low, it was a good learning opportunity,” says 33-year-old Arup. 
He learned about the quality and type of flowers, which fetched good money. Once back in Kolaghat, he began to sell marigold strings and gladiolus to flower shops in other cities.

“I would purchase them at Rs120 per string and sell at Rs140 to Rs150, making a profit of Rs2,000 to Rs3,000 on 100 strings. It was during this time that he realised the margins in commercial flower cultivation or floriculture. So he took one bigha (0.25 acre) of land on lease and decided to grow marigolds. “In 2011, I bought marigold saplings of the local Kolkata variety. It resulted in small-sized flowers and I suffered a loss,” he recollects.

After that loss, he decided to visit Thailand, which is home to one of the biggest flower markets in the world – the Bangkok Blossom Market. There, he saw high-quality flowers including the Tennis Ball Marigold variety, which produces bright, round flowers.

They are suited for long-distance shipping as the dense flowers don’t crush easily. The yields are high and there is a big market for this variety. 
The local variety, however, sells for Rs35 to Rs40 per kg. That is why many nursery owners now sell fakes of Thailand variety at high rates to make money. They, however, yield small flowers. 
 In Thailand, Arup met a farmer, who took him to a local nursery. He spent three months in that country and learned how to prepare seeds and saplings of the Tennis Ball Marigold variety. 

In 2012, Arup harvested a good amount of marigold flowers and sold them in the Kolaghat market at Rs100 per kg. “The local farmers began asking me for plants. Then I expanded to six bigha (1.5 acres) and started making saplings and seeds for others,” he says.


 The floriculture business

Today, people from across India buy Thai marigolds from his farm-cum-nursery in Kolaghat. “I have expanded cultivation to 63 bighas (21 acres). Every year, I sell four crore saplings and 1500 kg of seeds of the Thai variety,” he says.
 While he sells one lakh saplings for Rs40,000 (40 paise per plant), a kg of seeds cost Rs25,000. So his income from saplings is around Rs1.6 crore (4 crore X 40 paise) annually while seeds bring in Rs3.7 crore (1500kg X Rs25,000). 
Arup also sells marigold flowers for five months in a year. The rest of the time, the flowers are used to make seeds.
""I harvest around 800 kg to 1,000 kg marigold flowers daily, clocking Rs50,000 per day (Rs75 lakh in five months). The production dips during extremely cold weather,"" he adds.
The saplings are ready for sale around October. ""The plants are sold across India till mid- February. The maximum sales come from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (Pushkar and Ajmer),"" says Arup, adding that people have to place orders in advance.
Marigold seeds also sell out by January or early February every year, he adds. Flowers are dried, and their base is opened to collect the seeds, which resemble black and brown threads. These seeds are air-dried and are then ready for sale. ""One marigold flower gives around ten seeds,"" Arup points out.
He employs 80 workers on his farm who help in the preparation of saplings and seeds and also in harvesting and packaging of flowers. They are involved in every stage of flower cultivation and seed production.

""I give them higher-than-market wages,"" he adds.","Arup Ghosh learned to prepare seeds and saplings of high-yielding Tennis Ball marigold variety in Thailand. It produces bright, firm flowers that sell at a premium in the Indian market. He set up his farm and nursery in Kolaghat, West Bengal and now sells marigold saplings, flowers and seeds, clocking ₹50 lakh a month."

As per the video, initially, it seemed like the big cats were not going to attack, but within moments, one of the animals suddenly approached him, and he was heard calling its name “Simba”, telling it to stay quiet. Iriskulov then went ahead to stroke the big cat's mane.

After a few moments, he flipped his camera to show his face and stroked one of the animals that came near him. However, things took a horrifying turn once the lion attacked him, and he kept on shouting, ""Be quiet, be quiet.” He unintentionally captured his last moments on camera.

“Blood transfusion is the new era of maintaining young cells in your system especially when it comes from your own son or daughter,” Los Angeles resident Marcela Iglesia told the New York Post. Reportedly, she is a self-proclaimed “human Barbie”.

“There can be many benefits from the cells of a younger donor, especially if the donor is my own son,” she said, adding that she came to know about this treatment after she “tried stem cell therapy”.
How blood transfusion procedures work

Iglesias told the Sun, ""Blood transfusions bring fresh red blood cells to carry oxygen through your body,” adding, ""Plasma carries proteins and clotting factors, perfect for helping with bleeding or healing.” However, there is limited clinical evidence that “blood transfusions from a younger person can make you younger.”
Is it dangerous?

The Food and Drug Administration reportedly warned against plasma infusions from “young donors” in 2019. In an alert, the FDA wrote that the procedure carries “significant public health concerns.”

“The conditions range from normal aging and memory loss to serious diseases like dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease or post-traumatic stress disorder,” the alert said.

wig9tip1-1,"In a consumer-driven world of fast fashion, viral trends, and next-day deliveries, some millionaires and high-income earners are taking a markedly different approach to wealth accumulation. Instead of indulging in luxury, they are opting for an ‘underconsumption’ lifestyle, keeping discretionary spending minimal and focusing on long-term financial goals.

This growing trend, which has gained traction on social media platforms like TikTok, centres on frugal habits such as batch cooking, shopping second-hand, and avoiding unnecessary purchases. For the individuals interviewed by Fortune, these practices have not only bolstered their bank balances but also enabled flexible working schedules and the prospect of early retirement.

Shang Saavedra, a 39-year-old author and entrepreneur, credits her multi-million-dollar net worth to lessons in frugality learned during her childhood. Residing with her family in a rented four-bedroom home in suburban Los Angeles, Saavedra and her husband own a 16-year-old second-hand car and primarily shop at budget supermarkets like Aldi, focusing on frozen groceries to save costs.

Her two sons, aged five and two, wear hand-me-down clothes, play with toys sourced from Facebook Marketplace, and enjoy free activities rather than expensive outings like trips to Disneyland.

While Saavedra’s life bears hallmarks of a high-income household—such as her children attending private school and her ownership of a property in New York—these expenditures align with her financial philosophy: prioritising investments in education and assets that further philanthropic goals.

Saavedra, who held corporate roles at CVS and Victoria’s Secret before becoming an entrepreneur, told Fortune that she and her husband drastically reduced their expenses early in their careers. Living in a rent-controlled apartment in New York with unreliable plumbing, they saved one of their two incomes in preparation for starting a family.

“Underconsumption has to have a purpose,” Saavedra explained. “If you just do it for the sake of saving, you’ll burn out. For us, the goal was financial freedom and family, which made it worthwhile. Of course, I’m tempted by luxury items, and occasionally we indulge in a nice date night, but understanding the ‘why’ behind your choices keeps you grounded.”

Saavedra’s underconsumption habits extend to the festive season, during which her expenses rise only due to philanthropic gifting, a stark contrast to the 58% of Americans who report financial stress during the holidays, according to a Harris Poll.

Annie Cole, a 36-year-old personal finance expert and researcher, has also embraced a minimalist lifestyle despite owning assets worth over a million dollars and earning a six-figure income. By cutting monthly household expenses to under $4,000—well below the US average of $6,440 in 2023—Cole has significantly advanced her financial independence.

She sold her car, batch cooks meals, and shops for clothes three times a year at Goodwill, with her last new purchase being a gift card-funded item over a year ago. Holidays are funded through air miles accrued during her previous corporate role, and leisure activities include free pursuits such as hiking and swimming.

Cole has pencilled in retirement for her early 40s but acknowledges that her current part-time work already feels like semi-retirement. “Knowing that I could retire is a financial cushion in itself,” she said. “I’m living the flexibility now, working less and doing the things I love—it’s a blessing.”

For Robert Chin, a dentist in Las Vegas, the shift to an underconsumption lifestyle was driven by rising costs and a desire to align spending with long-term financial goals. Chin and his partner, Jessica Pharar, who run a dental practice together, now limit dining out to once or twice a month and buy groceries in bulk from Costco to mitigate inflation.

The couple prioritise durability in their purchases, choosing clothing brands with lifetime guarantees, and rent their home to retain flexibility for future property investments. “In five years, we hope to bring in another practitioner to allow us more time off,” Chin said. “As business leaders, it’s challenging to take breaks because if we’re not working, the practice doesn’t generate income.”

The underconsumption trend has also gained momentum on platforms like TikTok, where users share their frugal habits as a counter-narrative to the rampant consumerism often displayed online. Popular practices include setting no-buy challenges, decluttering spaces, and sharing cost-effective shopping tips.","Underconsumption lifestyle, a concept that has gained popularity, revolves around reducing discretionary spending and adopting habits like shopping second-hand, cooking at home, and avoiding unnecessary purchases. It's not about depriving oneself, but about making conscious choices that prioritise financial stability and future growth. A growing number of high-income earners are adopting it."
lgdvgk4w-1,"A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don’t tend to uphold their New Year’s resolutions much past the first month.

In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It’s called the ’Winter Arc.’

Here’s what to know.
What is the Winter Arc?

The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.

For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.

It’s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it’s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.

Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed “CEO of Glowup Series,” posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to “walking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.”

“I found it very transformative both mentally and physically,” Galebe says. “The consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.”

How can you participate?

Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it’s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.

“If you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,"" Rothstein says, “you will have an easier time adhering to the program.”

He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. “Recognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,” he says. “You should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.”

Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness “cozy and convenient” in the cold winter months.

“If the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,” she says. “Another tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.”

To recap:

    Set realistic, attainable goals.
    Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.
    Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.
    Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.

What’s the point?

Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide “positive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.”

When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. “Putting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It’s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.”

Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that’s not necessarily true.

“If the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,” Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way.","Winter Arc is a goal-setting challenge created online by fitness and wellness influencers.
